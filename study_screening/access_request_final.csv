Pesticides may easily reach and contaminate surface waterbodies mainly through drainage 7 and spray drift, and hence are currently viewed as a major contamination issue. Following recent discussion on the ability of adjuvant chemicals added to marketed formulations to contribute for pesticide toxicity, this study focuses the acute and chronic toxicity of the insecticide Lannate (R) and the herbicide Stam Novel Flo (R), as well as that of their active ingredients Methomyl and Propanil, to the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna. Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients. Chronic exposures can provide additional information on chemicals' toxicity in reproductive endpoints, which is of particular relevance when considering that pesticides are often repeatedly applied within a single agricultural season. Life-history endpoints assessed under mixture exposures indeed indicated higher Iona-term. 17 C, than short-term toxicity, and showed a distinct pattern of joint action when compared to acute toxicity assessments. These results suggest that long-term exposures can provide relevant complementary information on mixtures' toxicity that should be taken into account within pesticide risk assessment procedures.",2009,18,1281,1288,NA,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,paper not accessible,YES,PAPER,jpereira@bio.ua.pt,YES,YES,n/a

This means that nanoformulations aim to comply with the safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) concept, as a part of (re)designing to reduce their risks. However, the toxic effects of nanoformulations, particularly to non-target organisms, are poorly known, and even more so at the mechanistic level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of toxicity of atrazine when delivered as a nanoformulation of atrazine (nano_ATZ), a commercial atrazine-based formulation (Gesaprim), and the pure a.i. (ATZ). A high-throughput gene expression microarray (4 x 44 K) was used to assess transcriptomics in Enchytraeus crypticus (non-target species). Organisms were exposed, in soil, to equitoxic reproduction effect concentrations (EC10 and EC50) for 3 and 7 days. Results showed activation of genes involved in both general and well-known mechanisms of detoxification (e.g. cytochrome P450 and GST) for all the atrazine forms. Unique effects of nano_ATZ on transcripts linked to secretion, translocation and vesicle trafficking suggested that differentiated - nano-specific - uptake and/or cellular transport might be taking place.

Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of the lipophilic moiety on droplet spread; surfactant phytotoxicity, and surfactant enhancement of herbicide phytotoxicity. Six different lipophilic moieties and two herbicides were evaluated on four plant species. Each lipophilic moiety was represented by two surfactants: one with a low hydrophilic:lipophilic balance (HLB) value, near 12.0, and one with a high HLB value, near 16.0. Droplet spread was greater with low than high HLB surfactants and was greatest with trimethylnonanol ethoxylate (TMN); intermediate with secondary alcohol ethoxylate (SAE) and octylphenol ethoxylate (OPE), and least with linear alcohol ethoxylate (LAE), nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE), and oxysorbic (TWN). Surfactant enhancement of droplet spread was less on redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) than on barley (Hordeum vulgare), green foxtail (Setaria viridis), or kochia (Kochia scoparia). Isopropylamine salt of glyphosate [N- (phosphonomethyl)glycine] and the ammonium salt of imazethapyr {2- [4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl-5-oxo-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-5-ethyl-3- pyridinecarboxylic acid} had little effect on droplet spread. Lipophilic chemistry and HLB affected surfactant phytotoxicity to green foxtail, kochia, and redroot pigweed but not to barley. Foliar injury ranged from 1 to 23% with green foxtail, 0 to 17% with kochia, and 0 to 14% with redroot pigweed. Injury to barley was similar for all surfactants and ranged from 3 to 8%. Injury generally was greater with low than high HLB surfactants. However, SAE and OPE caused greater injury to green foxtail at high than low HLB. Green foxtail was the only plant species injured more than 8% by high HLB surfactants. Droplet spread did not correlate with surfactant phytotoxicity regardless of plant species. Glyphosate phytotoxicity generally was enhanced most by high HLB LAE to barley, green foxtail, and kochia and by high HLB TWN to redroot pigweed. Imazethapyr phytotoxicity was generally greatest when applied with high HLB SAE to barley and redroot pigweed, with high HLB LAE to green foxtail and with low HLB LAE to kochia.

Because of routine practice in various forms of conservation tillage, paraquat (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride) has increasingly been used for weed control in agricultural fields and in supporting management practices. Though highly adsorbed by soil and foliage, paraquat may gain increased notice as an agrichemical potentially impacting wetlands which surround much of the farmland across the country; consequently, amphibian toxicity evaluations may be incorporated into wildlife hazard assessments conducted for chemicals finding increased use in conservation tillage. Using amphibians representative of two anuran families, early life stage toxicity tests (96-h modified FETAX) were performed. Acute and subacute exposures were completed, and toxicity endpoints (mortality and teratogenicity) were evaluated for exposures to technical-grade and formulation-grade paraquat. These preliminary toxicity assessments suggested that acute and subacute endpoints for each form of paraquat may be significantly different, since the commercial formulation was three times as acutely toxic as the technical-grade chemical.

Invertebrate 48-h EC50’s (concentration immobilizing 50% of the test organisms) or LC50’s (concentration lethal to 50% of the test organisms) ranged from 2.4 μg/liter for amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) to 3, 200 μg/liter for larval midges (Chironomus plumosus).

Toxicities of the active ingredient to fishes were similar for the technical grade Imidan and the 50% wettable powder formulation. Toxicities to fish increased with the increasing temperature and decreasing pH, but were unaffected by water hardness. Eyed eggs and yolk-sac fry of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were more resistant to Imidan than were fingerlings. Aging of Imidan in water of 20 C and pH 7.2 decreased its toxicity. Four-day-old solutions were less than 0.04 as toxic as fresh solutions.

In this context, broad range bioassays have emerged providing economically viable and widely applicable alternatives due to their ability to detect the cumulative toxicity of mixtures of both known and unknown chemicals in a sample, thus allowing direct information about water quality. Here we present a low-cost, wide-range algae-based biosensor that is easy to assemble and operate by untrained users and provides direct readings. It was developed as a request of a peasant social movement organization to assess the toxicity of drinking water in rural communities affected by pesticide spraying. Two fresh water algae strains, Scenedesmus acutus and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, were immobilized in alginate beads and tested as bioindicators. After incubation with different pollutants for five days, naked eye analysis by several observers proved to be a successful method to survey algae's growth and establish the detection limits. Best detection limits were 10 ppm for technical-grade acid glyphosate, 15 ppm for glyphosate-based formulation, 50 ppb for atrazine formulation, 7.5 ppm for copper and 250 ppb for chromium. Absorbance measurements upon algae resuspension validated these results. The developed device was successfully tested in participatory workshops conducted at rural communities. Children, adults and elders with no scientific training were able to build the sensor and interpret the results, thus evaluating the quality of rain and well water used in their communities.

Unfortunately, the effects of such substances are still poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of the active neonicotinoid substance thiacloprid (TH) and the commercial product Calypso 480 SC (CA) (active compound 40.4% TH) on Mytilus galloprovincialis after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations.

The sublethal concentrations of both substances lead to abatement or completely stopping the byssal fibres creation. Biochemical analysis of haemolymph showed significant changes (P < 0.01) in electrolytes ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, S-phosphor), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity and glucose concentration following exposure to both substances.

The objectives were to determine the best tillage practice (conventional vs conservation tillage) in terms of grain yields and potential environmental risk, to assess insecticidal exposure using concentrations measured in soil and runoff water and sediments, to compare measured insecticidal concentrations with predicted concentrations from selected risk assessment exposure models, and to calculate toxicity benchmarks from laboratory bioassays performed on reference aquatic and terrestrial nontarget organisms, using individual active ingredients and the formulation. Corn grain yields were not significantly different based on tillage treatment. Similarly, field concentrations of insecticides were not significantly (p>0.05) different in strip tillage versus conventional tillage, suggesting that neither of the tillage systems would enable greater environmental risk from the insecticidal formulation. Risk quotients were calculated from field concentrations and toxicity data to determine potential risk to nontarget species.

Overall, alcohol ethoxylates may be potential alternatives for nonylphenol ethoxylates as they exhibited nearly comparative bioactivity against tested pests and toxicities to D. magna and B. rerio. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,204,44,50,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.04.034,YES,NO,YES,n/a,wasn't looking at ai vs formulation but ai + adjuvant.

However, the decrease of bee's population has been observed worldwide and besides other factors, this collapse is also related to the extensive use of pesticides. In this sense, studies involving the assessment of adverse effects and the uptake of pesticides by bees are of great concern. This work presents an analytical method for the determination of the insecticide abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris exposed via oral and topic to endpoints concentrations of active ingredients (a.i.) alone and in commercial formulations and the discussion about its mortality and uptake. For this purpose, QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged and Safe) acetate modified method was used for extraction and pesticides were determined by LC-MS/MS. The validation parameters have included: a linear range between 0.01 and 1.00 mu g mL(-1); and LOD and LOQ of 0.038 and 0.076 mu g g(-1) for abamectin and difenoconazole, respectively. The uptake of tested pesticides via oral and topic was verified by the accumulation in adult forager bees, mainly when the commercial product was tested. Mortality was observed to be higher in oral exposure than in topic tests for both pesticides. For abamectin in a commercial formulation (a.i.) no differences were observed for oral or topic exposure. On the other hand, for difenoconazole, topic exposure had demonstrated higher accumulation in bees, according to the increase of received dose. Through the results, uptake and the possible consequences of bioaccumulated pesticides are also discussed and can contribute to the knowledge about the risks involving the exposure of bees to these compounds.

scopus378,Guy,YES,Stephenson R.R.; Choi S.Y.; Olmos-Jerez A.,determining the toxicity and hazard to fish of a rice insecticide,Crop Protection,"The experiments described were carried out to establish whether the effects of the insecticide, Ripcord (active ingredient cypermethrin), on fish, would limit its use in rice. Laboratory and field experiments were carried out, and the effects of cypermethrin were compared with those of a 'standard insecticide', carbofuran, widely used for pest control in rice, and a 'positive control', chlorfenvinphos, expected to be toxic to fish in rice paddies at insecticidally effective rates. Acute toxicity tests in the laboratory with the technical materials on the fish Tilapia nilotica showed cypermethrin, with a 96 h LC50 value of 2 μg/ℓ, to be some 20 times more toxic than chlorfenvinphos, with a 96 h LC50 value of 39 μg/ℓ, and some 250 times more toxic than carbofuran with a 96 h LC50 of 480 μg/ℓ. The LC50 values obtained from laboratory tests with formulated products (cypermethrin EC, chlorfenvinphos granules and carbofuran granules) on T. nilotica and Cyprinus carpio were broadly in agreement with those obtained from the tests with the technical materials and confirmed C. carpio to have a similar susceptibility to that of T. nilotica. However, a field experiment carried out in paddy rice in Korea with commercial formulations and at commercial application rates showed that mortality of caged C. carpio was much less with cypermethrin (< 15%) than with chlorfenvinphos (97%) or carbofuran (67%). A second field experiment in Spain where cypermethrin was applied by air resulted in no mortality of caged C. carpio held in the paddy. It is concluded that the limited toxic effects of cypermethrin on fish in the field, when compared with those of chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran, make it acceptable for use in rice. The effects of cypermethrin were limited in comparison with those of chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran because only very low application rates of cypermethrin are needed to give pest control. The penetration of the liquid cypermethrin formulations into the water was also lower than that of the granular insecticides and, finally, cypermethrin was more rapidly lost from water. Together, these factors are sufficient to explain the minimal toxic effects of cypermethrin in the field when compared with chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran, despite its considerably higher acute toxicity determined in laboratory tests. © 1984.",1984,3,151,165,10.1016/0261-2194(84)90050-4,YES,NO,YES,n/a,old paper with no CIs.

Eighteen isolates, belonging to the genera Azotobacter Azospirillum, Bacillus, Enterobacter Pseudomonas and Serratia, were exposed to four active compounds at concentration ranges similar to those in field soil. The sulfonylureas chlorsulfuron and rimsulfuron inhibited the growth of one of two Azospirillum and one of four Pseudomonas strains, while the imidazolinones imazapyr and imazethapyr were effective on two out of five Bacillus isolates. Surfactants in commercial formulation significantly enhanced rimsulfuron toxicity. With the exception of one Azospirillum strain, the differential tolerance of rhizobacteria to these herbicides was related to a differential sensitivity of their target, the activity of the first enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). Greenhouse pot studies were performed to assess the occurrence of inhibitory effects on bacterial growth in field conditions. Maize seedlings were bacterized with the two strains which had shown in vitro sensitivity to sulfonylureas. Following the application to the soil of a commercial formulation of rimsulfuron at rates of 0, 0.2 and 0.5 mu mol a.i. kg(-1), significative differences in the resulting degree of bacterial root colonization were found. Moreover, upon co-inoculation with two strains, one tolerant and one sensitive to the herbicide, the presence of rimsulfuron significantly enhanced root occupancy by resistant bacteria, suggesting that shifts in the microbial community structure of crop rhizosphere could indeed result as a consequence of weed control by AHAS inhibitors.",1995,176,243,253,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011788,YES,NO,YES,BACTERIAL GROWTH,was looking at bacterial growth but the formulation work was not indicated.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the toxicity of glyphosate, its by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and two commercial formulations, Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and Roundup Allees et Terrasses (R) (R-AT), containing glyphosate as the active ingredient, on the early life stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h. Experiments involving both endpoints included range finding experiments for herbicide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100,000 mu g L-1. This range was then narrowed down in order to determine precise EC50 values. Actual concentrations of the herbicide were determined at the beginning and after 48 h (embryotoxicity) and 24 h (metamorphosis) to evaluate the potential temporal variation in the concentrations. During embryo-larval development, no mortalities were recorded at any of the concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, whereas no embryos or D-shaped larvae could be observed after exposure to 10,000 mu g L-1 of R-EX or R-AT. Compared with the controls, no effects on embryo-larval development were recorded between 0.1 and 1000 mu g L-1, regardless of the chemical tested. Above a threshold, which varied according to the chemical used, the gradient of herbicide concentrations correlated with a gradient of severity of abnormality ranging from normal larvae to arrested development (an old embryo stage). The EC50 values were 28,315 and 40,617 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and its metabolite, respectively, but much lowered values of 1133 and 1675 mu g L-1 for R-EX and R-AT, respectively. Metamorphosis tests also revealed a significant difference between molecules, as the EC50 values exceeded 100,000 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and AMPA but were as low as 6366 and 6060 mu g L-1 for the commercial formulations, which appeared relatively more toxic. Overall, the embryo-larval development of C. gigas was more sensitive to glyphosate-based herbicides compared to various endpoints studied in regulatory model organisms, and embryos and D-shaped larvae were more sensitive compared to pediveliger larvae.

SC-0224 is the trimethylsulfonium (TMS) salt of N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine (PMG), whereas glyphosate is commercially formulated as the isopropylamine (IPA) salt of PMG. Both formulated and technical grade forms of SC-0224 were found to be much more phytotoxic to duckweed than either formulated or technical grade forms of glyphosate. The growth inhibition caused by glyphosate was partially prevented by different combinations of the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp; whereas, the duckweed growth inhibition caused by SC-0224 could not be reduced by the same amino acid combinations. Trimethylsulfonium ion (TMS), the cationic constituent of the SC-0224 salt,and SC-0224 were found to be equally phytotoxic to duckweek indicating that the phytotoxic effects of TMS may be responsible for differences in the action of glyphosate and SC-0224 on duckweed. SC-0224 and glyphosate equally inhibited the production of anthranilate in the cell-free extract of K. pneumoniae, whereas TMS caused no inhibition.

Therefore, thorough assessment of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is a high-priority task. An enzyme inhibition-based assay is used in this study as a convenient and quick tool to study the effects of pesticides at the molecular level. The contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulations has been studied by analyzing effects of 7 active ingredients of pesticides (AIas) and 10 commercial formulations based on them (AIfs) on the function of a wide range of enzyme assay systems differing in complexity (single-, coupled, and three-enzyme assay systems). Results have been compared with the effects of AIas and AIfs on bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. Mostly, AIfs produce a considerably stronger inhibitory effect on the activity of enzyme assay systems and bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium than AIas, which confirms the contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulation. Results of the current study demonstrate that “inert” ingredients are not ecotoxicologically safe and can considerably augment the inhibitory effect of pesticide formulations; therefore, their use should be controlled more strictly. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of the enzymes used for assays do not show any changes in the protein structure in the presence of commercial pesticide formulations during the assay procedure.

Strategies are sought to reduce the toxicity of this fungicide and alternative treatments are welcome. An alternative could be the use of clove oil, which has Eugenol as its major compound, and has antifungal potential against G. cingulata, however, Eugenol is susceptible to degradation processes which may compromise its efficacy. The nanoencapsulation of Mancozeb and Eugenol is a possible strategy to overcome the limitations of toxicity, solubility and instability of these compounds. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop nanoemulsions containing Mancozeb (0.1 mg/mL) and Eugenol (33 mg/mL), isolated or associated, and evaluate the safety of these formulations through cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and ecotoxicity tests. Nanoemulsions were developed by the spontaneous emulsification method, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in healthy human cells through MTT, Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and Picogreen tests, and ecotoxicity assessment was carried out using the chronic toxicity test in springtails. After preparation, the physicochemical characterization of the nanoemulsions were performed which presented mean particle size between 200 and 300 nm, polydispersity index less than 0.3, negative zeta potential and acid pH.

In the ecotoxicity tests, both free Mancozeb and Eugenol forms presented high toxic potential for soil, whereas the nanoencapsulation of these compounds did not cause a reduction in number of springtails.

The biochemical pathway for aromatic amino acid synthesis (Shikimate pathway), which is specifically inhibited by glyphosate, is shared by plants and numerous bacterial species. Several in vitro studies have shown that various groups of intestinal bacteria may be differently affected by glyphosate. Here, we present results from an animal exposure trial combining deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial community with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolic profiling of aromatic amino acids and their downstream metabolites. We found that glyphosate as well as the commercial formulation Glyfonova (R) 450 PLUS administered at up to fifty times the established European Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI = 0.5 mg/kg body weight) had very limited effects on bacterial community composition in Sprague Dawley rats during a two-week exposure trial. The effect of glyphosate on prototrophic bacterial growth was highly dependent on the availability of aromatic amino acids, suggesting that the observed limited effect on bacterial composition was due to the presence of sufficient amounts of aromatic amino acids in the intestinal environment. A strong correlation was observed between intestinal concentrations of glyphosate and intestinal pH, which may partly be explained by an observed reduction in acetic acid produced by the gut bacteria. We conclude that sufficient intestinal levels of aromatic amino acids provided by the diet alleviates the need for bacterial synthesis of aromatic amino acids and thus prevents an antimicrobial effect of glyphosate in vivo. It is however possible that the situation is different in cases of human malnutrition or in production animals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The toxic effects of these chemicals were evaluated in the fish embryo acute toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio), while genotoxic effects were investigated in the comet assays with cells from zebrafish larvae and rainbow trout gonad-2 (RTG-2). GLY and AMPA caused no acute toxic effect, while ATN and POEA induced significant lethal effects in zebrafish (LC50-96 h 76.50 mg/L and 5.49 mg/L, respectively). All compounds were genotoxic in comet experiments with zebrafish larvae (LOEC 1.7 mg/L for GLY, ATN, AMPA and 0.4 mg/L for POEA). Unlike in vivo, only POEA induced DNA damage in RTG-2 cells (LOEC 1.6 mg/L), suggesting that it is a direct acting genotoxic agent. In summary, these data indicate that the lethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages can be ranked in the following order from most to least toxic: surfactant POEA > formulation ATN > active ingredient GLY approximate to metabolite AMPA.

Common waterhemp has become a key weed in midwestern crop production systems and is a good target for a bioherbicide that could be integrated into weed management systems. We investigated the direct effects of a range of chemical herbicides and adjuvants upon conidia of M. amaranthi and found that many herbicides and most adjuvants were strongly inhibitory to germination. On the other hand, M. amaranthi was compatible with a selection of post-emergence herbicides commonly used in midwestern weed management systems, including carfentrazone, chloransulam, and imazethapyr. Most glyphosate products suppressed or abolished germination of M. amaranthi conidia, but by testing adjuvants commonly used in glyphosate products and technical-grade glyphosate salts, it was revealed that this inhibition was due to formulation additives and not the active ingredient. When glyphosate and conidia of M. amaranthi were sprayed onto common waterhemp seedlings, the herbicide predisposed plants to infection by M amaranthi. When M. amaranthi was applied 1 to 3 d after glyphosate, the glyphosate rate required to control common waterhemp was reduced by half Similar results were observed on clones propagated from a common waterhemp plant resistant to glyphosate. When M. amaranthi was applied to seedlings 2 d before glyphosate, the efficacy of the herbicide was reduced. These findings demonstrate that positive interactions between herbicides and M. amaranthi exist but reveal practical difficulties that may limit the integration of the strategy in the field.",2006,54,532,537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-05-102R1.1,YES,NO,YES,n/a,frond germination of a fungi biopesticide.

However, concerns regarding its safety, side effects, and impact on other organisms have increased in recent years. This is the first study to analyze a large set of recent and historical Escherichia coli isolates varying in pathogenicity and beta-lactam resistance from different host species for their susceptibility to glyphosate isopropylamine salt (IPA), the active ingredient of the herbicide, and to a complete glyphosate-containing formulation (Roundup LB Plus). For this, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for 238 E. coli isolates by broth microdilution in Mueller Hinton I media followed by the statistical analyses using Mann-Whitney-U test, multivariable analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a multivariable proportional-odds ordinal regression model. While the overall MIC distribution was narrow and lacked a highly resistant sub-population for both substances, statistical analyses revealed small but significant associations between glyphosate resistance levels and different factors tested. Mean MIC values for the entire dataset showed a higher level of resistance to the complete glyphosate-containing formulation (40 mg/ml IPA) than to pure glyphosate (10 mg/ml IPA) in E. coli. Isolates that originated from poultry had significantly higher MIC values for both pure glyphosate and the complete formulation. Pathogenic and non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (non-ESBL) E. coli isolates each showed significantly higher MIC values compared to commensals and ESBL-producing E. coli in pure glyphosate, but not in the complete formulation. Recently sampled isolates showed statistically higher MICs than the isolates of the historic standard E. coli collection of reference in pure glyphosate, when tested by nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test, but not in the multivariable model. Further investigations are necessary to confirm whether these associations have a casual relationship with the glyphosate use or are the consequence of co-selection due to the increased application rates of antibiotics, heavy metals or other biocides. A possible accumulation of pathogenic bacteria in livestock animals fed with glyphosate-containing feed should also be considered. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

In order to evaluate the response of two filamentous cyanobacteria isolated from marine environment, Pseudanabaena sp. (MB.1007) and Leptolyngbya sp. (MB.1010) were exposed to different concentration of technical grades (5–100 μg.mL−1) and formulated commercial products (5–500 μg.mL−1) of cypermethrin and deltamethrin. Morphological parameters, growth rates, photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrates, lipids, ash, moisture, and protein contents were estimated. Cypermethrin at concentrations up to 20 μg.mL−1 stimulated growth rates, photosynthetic pigments, and biochemical parameters while deltamethrin showed inhibitory effects. Cypermethrin treated cells exhibited significant survivability as compared to those treated with deltamethrin. Analysis of recovered pesticides from the treated media showed the efficiency of both strains in pyrethroid removal. Pseudanabaena sp.

Acute and chronic intoxication of humans and animals, contamination of soil, water and food are the consequences of the current demand and sales of these products. In addition, pesticides such as glyphosate are sold in commercial formulations which have inert ingredients, substances with unknown composition and proportion. Facing this scenario, toxicological studies that investigate the interaction between the active principle and the inert ingredients are necessary. The following work proposed comparative toxicology studies between glyphosate and its commercial formulation using the alternative model Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms were exposed to different concentrations of the active ingredient (glyphosate in monoisopropylamine salt) and its commercial formulation. Reproductive capacity was evaluated through brood size, morphological analysis of oocytes and through the MD701 strain (bcIs39), which allows the visualization of germ cells in apoptosis. In addition, the metal composition in the commercial formulation was analyzed by ICP-MS. Only the commercial formulation of glyphosate showed significant negative effects on brood size, body length, oocyte size, and the number of apoptotic cells. Metal analysis showed the presence of Hg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb in the commercial formulation, which did not cause reprotoxicity at the concentrations found. However, metals can bio-accumulate in soil and water and cause environmental impacts. Finally, we demonstrated that the addition of inert ingredients increased the toxic profile of the active ingredient glyphosate in C. elegans, which reinforces the need of components description in the product labels.

As an example, testing on the formulated product is waived in Europe using an assessment of data for the constituent active substance(s). This is often not the case globally, because some countries require acute toxicity tests with every formulated product, thereby triggering animal welfare concerns through unnecessary testing. A database of 383 formulated products was compiled from acute toxicity studies conducted with northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (unpublished regulatory literature). Of the 383 formulated products studied, 159 contained only active substances considered functionally nontoxic (median lethal dose [LD50] > highest dose tested). Of these, 97% had formulated product LD50 values of > 2000 mg formulated product/kg (limit dose), indicating that no new information was obtained in the formulated product study. Furthermore, defined (point estimated) LD50 values for formulated products were compared with LD50 values predicted from toxicity of the active substance(s). This demonstrated that predicted LD50 values were within 2-fold and 5-fold of the measured formulated product LD50 values in 90% and 98% of cases, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that avian acute toxicity testing of formulated products is largely unnecessary and should not be routinely required to assess avian acute toxicity. In particular, when active substances are known to be functionally nontoxic, further formulated product testing adds no further information and unnecessarily increases bird usage in testing. A further analysis highlights the fact that significant reductions (61% in this dataset) could be achieved by using a sequential testing design (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 223), as opposed to established single-stage designs.

The toxicity of copper and dimethomorph alone and in combination, was assessed by growth inhibition of L. minor cultures after 96 and 168 h. Copper had a severe impact on growth (max. inhibition: 90 % at 1,000 mu g L-1) while dimethomorph (as pure ingredient or formulated as Forum) did not (inhibition < 45 % at 1,000 mu g L-1) after 168 h of treatment. When both chemicals were combined, synergism was observed after 96 h of exposure to copper and Forum. However, this interaction was a simple additivity after 168 h. Additivity was also observed when the pure active ingredient (dimethomorph) replaced Forum in the mixture of copper and dimethomorph at 96 and 168 h. L. minor showed an excellent performance in removing copper from the medium since after 96 h, 36, 60, and 76 % removal were reached for 10, 20, and 30 mu g L-1 of Cu respectively.

Accumulation of copper in plants was also increased by Forum but not by the active ingredient alone. Depuration of Forum by L. minor varied between 10 and 40 % after 96 h and it was generally more efficient than that of the pure ingredient.

While pesticides are used for the improvement of crop yields, they also present a burden for soil organisms. To understand the complex effects of pesticides on soil organisms, it is important to test these effects in soil exposures to include influences of the soil matrix on the toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission. The results show the potential hazards associated with the usage of the tested pesticides and the importance of evaluating the effects of commercial pesticide preparations for a more realistic insight into the adverse effects on the environment. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,13,NA,NA,10.3390/agriculture13020271,YES,NO,YES,n/a,request data and try and calculate LC50,YES,DATA,mirna.velki@gmail.com,YES,YES,n/a

The fungicide Pristine (R) and its active ingredients (25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) have been reported to have low acute toxicity to caged honey bee workers, but many sublethal effects at field-relevant doses have been reported and Pristine (R) was recently found to increase worker pollen consumption, reduce worker longevity and colony populations at field relevant concentrations (Fisher et al. 2021). To directly compare these whole-colony field results to more standard laboratory toxicology tests, the effects of Pristine (R), at a range of field-relevant concentrations, were assessed on the survival and pollen consumption of honey bee workers 0-14 days of age. Also, to separate the effects of the inert and two active ingredients, bees were fed pollen containing boscalid, pyraclostrobin, or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid, at concentrations matching those in the Pristine (R) treatments. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced pollen consumption across the duration of the experiment, and dose dependently reduced pollen consumption on days 12-14. Pristine (R) and boscalid significantly reduced pollen feeding rate on days 12-14. Boscalid reduced survival in a dose-dependent manner. Consumption of Pristine (R) or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid did not affect survival, providing evidence against strong negative effects of the inert ingredients in Pristine (R) and against negative synergistic effects of boscalid and pyraclostrobin. The stronger toxic effects of Pristine (R) observed in field colonies compared to this laboratory test, and the opposite responses of pollen consumption in the laboratory and field to Pristine (R), show that standard laboratory toxicology tests can fail to predict responses of pollinators to pesticides and to provide protection.",2021,226,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112841,YES,NO,YES,n/a,tested many concentrations but range was very small.

scopus3456,Guy,YES,Meredith A.N.; Harper B.; Harper S.L.,the influence of size on the toxicity of an encapsulated pesticide: a comparison of micron  and nano sized capsules,Environment International,"Encapsulation technology involves entrapping a chemical active ingredient (a.i.) inside a hollow polymeric shell and has been applied to commercial pesticide manufacturing for years to produce capsule suspension (CS) formulations with average particle sizes in the micron-scale. The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50μm. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2μm with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (~200nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (~250nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (~2200nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20μg a.i. L-1 technical λ-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016,86,68,74,10.1016/j.envint.2015.10.012,YES,NO,YES,n/a,No CIs reported.

Interestingly, DNA microarray analysis revealed that there were no significant gene expression changes in the medaka liver after exposure to glyphosate. Nevertheless, 78 and 138 genes were significantly induced by DA and the glyphosate/DA mixture, respectively. Furthermore, we identified five common genes that were affected by DA and glyphosate/DA mixture.

To investigate whether simultaneous exposure to another stress factor influences effects of the contaminants, we performed tests both in the presence or absence of predator chemical cues. We found that the surfactant had significant harmful effects on tadpoles; survival was lowered by the highest concentration of the surfactant in case of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo tadpoles it reduced survival already at medium concentrations. Body mass was significantly influenced by medium and high surfactant concentrations in both species. The presence of glyphosate did not have a significant effect by itself, but it slightly increased mortality in tadpoles exposed to medium concentrations of the surfactant in both species. The presence of chemical cues did not have an effect on the examined variables. Our study confirms that the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides is mainly due to the examined surfactant.

Analytical measurements were performed both by HPLC-UV and commercial ELISA methods. Loss rates of LASs were found different in these aqueous matrices, with decomposition rates higher for the neat surfactant mixture than for MOSPILAN 20 SG (nearly 2- and 9-fold in distilled water and in surface water from River Danube, respectively). Half-lives determined in surface water from River Danube were shown to be affected by the presence of neonicotinoid AIs thiacloprid > imidacloprid > acetamiprid (ACE), while clothianidin and thiamethoxam did not affect LAS decomposition. Aquatic toxicity of MOSPILAN 20 SG, along with that of its AI ACE and co-formulant LAS, as well as the mixture of ACE and LAS was also investigated in the 48-h acute immobilisation assay on the water flea (Daphnia magna) aquatic indicator organism. LAS appeared to be significantly (8-fold) more toxic in the D. magna test than ACE, and the toxicity of the formulated insecticide was found to be 1.3 and 19.6 times higher than explained by its AI and LAS content, respectively, indicating synergistic toxicity. The strongest synergy between ACE and LASs was observed, when the neat forms of the two substances were applied in combination at concentrations equivalent to those in MOSPILAN 20 SG.

Phytotoxicity assessments were conducted in the laboratory on the common green alga Selenastrum capricornutum using both the active ingredient of the herbicides and their formulated products (for MCPA and butylate). Endpoints determined after the 96 h exposure included algal population growth inhibition (IC50-cell counts), percent lethality (LC(50)-flow cytometry derived) and photosynthetic electron transport inhibition (EC(50)-fluorescence induction). Pesticide formulations had greater toxic effects than the active ingredient alone. The 96 h IC50 (50% Inhibition Concentration) and LOEC (Lowest Observable effects Concentration) using cell counts of S. capricornutum were 18.4 and 8.9 mg l(-1) respectively for MCPA-active ingredient and for MCPA-formulated, these were 0.62 and 0.0062 mg l(-1) respectively. Those for butylate-active ingredient were 61.0 and 8.3 mg l(-1) and for butylate-formulated 1.46 and 0.17 mg l(-1), respectively. The triazines active ingredient, which are photosynthetic inhibitors, had greater effects than either the MCPA or butylate. The IC50 for cyanazine and atrazine were 0.059 and 0.026 mg l(-1), respectively. By comparing the IC50 and LC(50) values for the tested active ingredients, it was found that the effects of atrazine were algicidal, whereas those of cyanazine, butylate and MCPA were algistatic.

Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max (TM) (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick (TM) (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49 mg L-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick (TM). Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period. The mobility of glyphosate in the soils proved very low thus risks to aquatic ecosystems due to application of glyphosate-based herbicides may occur rather in case of direct contamination of surface water.

The worldwide used neonicotinoid insecticides and their components can reach surface waters, due to their physico-chemical properties (e.g. water solubility) or improper application in chemical plant protection technology, and can adversely affect non-target aquatic organisms. Formulated pesticides were analysed for alkane sulphonate surfactants by using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. In acute immobilisation tests on Daphnia magna, differences were found among the toxicity of the investigated neonicotinoid AIs and formulations. The toxicity of a formulated insecticide (APACHE 50 WG (R) - AI: clothianidin) was found to be 46.5 times more toxic than explained by its AI, probably due to toxic effect of the formulating agents on D. magna. In contrast, two preparations (CALYPSO 480 SC (R) - AI: thiacloprid, ACTARA 240 SC (R) - AI: thiamethoxam) were 2-3 times less toxic than their AIs.

For this reason elevated concentrations are expected in aquatic environment. Despite this fact, there is still a lack of data available on its possible risk for the environment. In this study, the potential hazards of imidacloprid and its commercial product Confidor SL 200 to aquatic environment were identified by the acute and chronic toxicity assessment using bacteria Vibrio fischeri, algae Desmodesmus subspicatus, crustacean Daphnia magna, fish Danio, rerio and the ready biodegradability determination. We found out, that imidacloprid was not highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial product. Imidacloprid was found persistent in water samples and not readily biodegradable in aquatic environment. Due to increased future predicted use of commercial products containing imidacloprid and the findings of this work, we recommend additional toxicity and biodegradability studies of other commercial products with imidacloprid as an active constituent.

Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.",2019,209,1,12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.015,YES,YES,NO,MORPHOLOGY/BEHAVIOUR/DEVELOPMENT,n/a

Its market is growing steadily concurrently with the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant transgenic crops and emergence of weeds less sensitive to glyphosate. Ephemeral and lentic waters near to agricultural lands, representing favorite habitats for amphibian reproduction and early life-stage development, may thus be contaminated by glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs) residues. Previous studies on larval anuran species highlighted increased mortality and growth effects after exposure to different GBHs in comparison to glyphosate itself, mainly because of the surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine present in the formulations. Nevertheless, these conclusions are not completely fulfilled when the early development, characterized by primary organogenesis events, is considered. In this study, we compare the embryotoxicity of Roundup((R)) Power 2.0, a new GBH formulation currently authorized in Italy, with that of technical grade glyphosate using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay Xenopus (FETAX). Our results evidenced that glyphosate was not embryolethal and only at the highest concentration (50 mg a.e./L) caused edemas. Conversely, Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 exhibited a 96 h LC50 of 24.78 mg a.e./L and a 96 h EC50 of 7.8 mg a.e./L. A Teratogenic Index of 3.4 was derived, pointing out the high teratogenic potential of the Roundup((R)) Power 2.0. Specific concentration-dependent abnormal phenotypes, such as craniofacial alterations, microphthalmia, narrow eyes and forebrain regionalization defects were evidenced by gross malformation screening and histopathological analysis. These phenotypes are coherent with those evidenced in Xenopus laevis embryos injected with glyphosate, allowing us to hypothesize that the teratogenicity observed for Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 may be related to the improved efficacy in delivering glyphosate to cells, guaranteed by the specific surfactant formulation. In conclusion, the differences in GBH formulations should be carefully considered by the authorities, since sub-lethal and/or long-term effects (e.g. teratogenicity) can be significantly modulated by the active ingredient salt type and concentration of the adjuvants. Finally, the mechanistic toxicity of glyphosate and GBHs are worthy of further research.",2018,195,103,113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.12.007,YES,YES,NO,DEVELOPMENT,n/a

Tests were carried out with the active ingredients diuron and carbofuran and one of their commercial formulations, the Dittman Nortox (R) 500 SC and the Furadan (R) 350 SC, respectively. For carbofuran, the active ingredient was more toxic than the commercial product, whereas for diuron, the commercial product appeared more toxic. In addition, hormetic effects on fertility were recorded for intermediate diuron concentrations. Acute and chronic toxicity data indicated that C. silvestrii was among the most sensitive invertebrate species for both test compounds.

Factors contributing to the decline of mussel populations likely include pesticides and other aquatic contaminants: however, there is a paucity of data regarding the toxicity of even the most globally distributed pesticides, including glyphosate. to mussels. Therefore, the toxicity of several forms of glyphosate, its formulations, and a surfactant (MON 0818) used in several glyphosate formulations was determined for early life stages of Lampsilis siliquoidea, a native freshwater mussel. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were performed with a newly established American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard guide for conducting toxicity tests with freshwater mussels. Roundup's, its active ingredient, the technical-grade isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, IPA alone, and MON 0818 (the surfactant in Roundup formulations) were each acutely toxic to L. siliquoidea glochidia. MON 0818 was most toxic of the compounds tested and the 48-h median effective concentration (0.5 mg/L) for L. siliquoidea glochidia is the lowest reported for any aquatic organism tested to date. Juvenile L. siliquoidea were also acutely sensitive to MON 0818. Roundup, glyphosate IPA salt, and IPA alone. Technical-grade glyphosate and Aqua Star((R)) were not acutely toxic to glochidia or juveniles. Ranking of relative chronic toxicity of the glyphosate-related compounds to juvenile mussels was similar to the ranking of relative acute toxicity to juveniles. Growth data from chronic tests was largely inconclusive.

Despite evidence that glochidia and juvenile life stages are highly sensitive to some chemical contaminants, the effects of pesticides on early life stages of unionid mussels are largely unknown. In the United States, pesticide registration is based on toxicity data of the active ingredient, not formulations as they are sold and applied. Some pesticide formulations, however, are more toxic than their active ingredient (technical -grade pesticide) alone because of the presence of surfactants, adjuvants, or other ingredients in the formulation. The objective of the present study was to compare the toxicity of active ingredients of several current-use pesticides (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) to the toxicity of pesticide formulations to glochidia and juvenile life stages of a freshwater mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea). The atrazine formulation (Aatrex) was more toxic than technical-grade atrazine in chronic tests with juvenile L. siliquoidea. For other pesticides, acute and chronic toxicity of technical-grade pesticides were similar to the toxicity of pesticide formulations. Median effective concentrations for chlorpyrifos were 0.43 mg/L for glochidia at 48 h, 0.25 mg/L for juveniles at 96 h, and 0.06 mg/L for juveniles at 21 d. Atrazine and permethrin as well as their formulations did not cause significant acute toxicity in glochidia or juveniles at exposure concentrations approaching water-solubility limits.

Residue of the insecticide is frequently detected in trace to moderate concentration in food grains and in surface water of different freshwater ecosystems of the country. In this study, 96 h LC50 of the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus were determined as 90.0 and 42.0 mu g/L based on 2 h actual concentration of chlorpyrifos in water. About 96 h exposure to sublethal concentrations (0, 12.0 and 25.0 mu g/L) of the commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos reduced the level of hepatic glycogen, activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase, and catalase in liver and elevated the level of plasma glucose and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase in O. niloticus. About 28-day exposure to these sub-lethal concentrations caused anemia in fish, while 90 days exposure reduced growth of the fish and carcass concentration of crude protein and crude lipid as compared to control. It was concluded from this study that commercial formulation of chlorpyrifos (20% EC) was highly toxic to O. niloticus.

Nevertheless, information about the impact of pesticides on amphibian populations remains scarce. The present study sought to identify the effects of malathion, an organophosphorus insecticide, on 21(st) stage larvae of the marsh frog, Rana ridibunda, with an acute toxicity test using a static system. Each experimental group contained 10 healthy larvae and was exposed to different concentrations of technical and formulation grade malathion for 96 h. Concentrations of malathion that caused 50% mortality (LC(50)) at 96 h were estimated using a probit analysis program. The results showed that formulation grade malathion (LC(50) = 29 ppm) was more toxic than technical grade malathion (LC(50) = 38 ppm).

There is, however, a recent trend for the cultivation of cycloxydim-tolerant maize hybrids for use in maize production. We studied the acute toxic effects of the complementary herbicide Focus(A (R)) Ultra and its active ingredient cycloxydim on embryos and early-stage larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). The results indicate that the herbicide formulation is significantly more toxic than the active ingredient alone. Therefore, it is suggested that the added substances either solely or in a synergistic action with the active ingredient are responsible for adverse effects. The formulation was found to be moderately toxic to embryos but highly toxic to early larvae. Based on calculated teratogenic indices, both cycloxydim and Focus(A (R)) Ultra seem to be non-teratogenic and also the minimum Focus(A (R)) Ultra concentration to inhibit growth in embryos and larvae was close to the LC50 values. The data suggest that tests with the rainbow trout are not in all cases appropriate to assess the risk in aquatically developing anurans. This is demonstrated by 96-h LC50 values, which are for rainbow trout more than 50- to 20-fold higher than for early X. laevis larvae.

The shallow tidal creeks and ditches that directly drain agricultural fields are home to the young of the ecologically and economically important blue crab, Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896). Massive mortality observed by peeler crab fishers led us to investigate the acute toxicity of several commercial pesticide formulations and their active ingredients to blue crab megalopae and J1-J4 stage juveniles. Twenty-four hour acute toxicity assays were conducted with the organophosphate acephate (Orthene (R)), the carbamate aldicarb, the chloro-nicotinyl imidacloprid (Trimax (TM)), the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin (Karate (R) with Zeon Technology), and the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup (R) Pro. LC50 values ranged from 0.22 mu g/L for megalopae exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin to 316,000 mu g/L for juveniles exposed to Roundup. The acute toxicities of active ingredient insecticides to blue crabs followed the order: lambda-cyhalothrin > imidacloprid approximate to aldicarb > acephate. Megalopae were almost always more sensitive than juveniles and there was little difference between the LC(50)s of each commercial formulation and its active ingredient. Treatment of intermolt megalopae with LC20 levels of Roundup resulted in significantly reduced time to metamorphosis (TTM) compared to estuarine water controls, while no differences resulted from treatment with the four active ingredient insecticides. Treatment with acephate, aldicarb, imidacloprid, and Roundup significantly increased the frequency of juveniles that died within 6 h of molting. The sensitivity of molting blue crabs to these pesticides makes frequently molting juveniles particularly vulnerable to pesticides in estuaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The formulated herbicides tested were Eradicane® (EPTC), Fargo® (triallate), Lasso® (alachlor), ME4 Brominal® (bromoxynil), Ramrod® (propachlor), Rodeo® (glyphosate), Sencor® (metribuzin), and Sutan (+)® (butylate); the two surfactants were Activator N.F.® and Ortho X-77®. In addition, technical grade alachlor, metribuzin, propachlor, and triallate were tested for comparison with the formulated herbicides. The relative toxicity of the commercial formulations, based on percent active ingredient, varied considerably. The EC50 values ranged from 1.23 mg/L for Fargo® to 5,600 mg/L for Rodeo®. Fargo®, ME4 Brominal®, and Ramrod® were moderately toxic to midge larvae; Lasso®, Sutan (+)®, and Eradicane® were slightly toxic; and Sencor® and Rodeo® were practically non-toxic. The 48-hr EC50 values of the two surfactants were nearly identical and were considered moderately toxic to midges. For two of the herbicides in which the technical grade material was tested, the inert ingredients in the formulations had a significant effect on the toxicity of the active ingredients. Fargo® was twice as toxic as technical grade triallate, whereas Sencor® was considerably less toxic than technical grade metribuzin. A comparison of the slope function values indicated that the toxic action of all the compounds occurred within a relatively narrow range. Published acute toxicity data on these compounds for other freshwater biota were tabulated and compared with our results. In general, the relative order of toxicity to C. riparius was similar to those for other freshwater invertebrates and fish. Maximum concentrations of each herbicide in bulk runoff during a projected ""critical"" runoff event were calculated as a percentage of the application rate lost in a given volume of runoff.

For the Fl and F2 generations, LC50S were >0.37 mg a.s./kg dry soil for both compounds. Actara was more toxic towards reproduction in the F1 generation (EC50 0.16 mg a.s./kg dry soil) than pure thiamethoxam (EC50 0.23 mg a.s./kg dry soil). For generation F2, there was no significant difference in the toxicity of the compounds towards reproduction, with EC50S of >0.37 and 0.30 mg a.s./kg dry soil for Actara (R) and pure thiamethoxam respectively. These results suggest a slight decrease in the toxicity of the compounds throughout the generations tested. The similarity in the toxicity of pure and formulated thiamethoxam indicates that the ingredients in the formulation Actara (R) do not enhance toxicity.",2018,27,764,771,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1922-8,YES,YES,NO,REPRODUCTION,n/a

Aquatic ecosystems in the proximity of agricultural areas are particularly vulnerable to pesticides, which cause underperformance or extinction of non-target sensitive species. Once in the aquatic system, these chemicals can affect biological processes at multiple levels (molecular, individual, populational), causing ecosystem imbalance across multiple scales. In this study, the effect of a commercial formulation of a herbicide (Primextra (R) Gold TZ) and its main active ingredient (a.i., S-metolachlor) was studied on a freshwater cladoceran species (Daphnia longispina), at different levels of biological organization and temporal scales. S-metolachlor is used in many herbicide formulations applied in corn/maize cultures, which is a relevant culture worldwide. As a first step, the acute and chronic effects of both commercial formulation and a.i. were quantified, and both formulations negatively affected the cladoceran's survival and reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction, number of offspring and number of broods), as well as the population's rate of increase. Whilst acute effects were comparable, the commercial formulation was slightly more toxic (EC50 was two-times lower) than the a.i. in chronic exposures, being prejudicial to D. longispina populations above 4.0 mg/L of S-metolachlor. In a second experimental step, we focused on the potential multi-generational impacts of the exposure to the a.i. alone on biochemical (lipid biomarkers, namely fatty acids) and populational responses, because of the relevance of S-metolachlor as a biosynthesis inhibitor in many herbicidal formulations. The herbicide caused a significant decrease in Daphnia fecundity (in the size of the 1st clutch), but no concomitant alterations were found in fatty acid profiles of mothers or offspring. More important, this experiment showed that S-metolachlor did not cause effects in the subsequent generation, thus suggesting that biotic communities may recover after exposure to the xenobiotic.

As a side effect, however, these insecticides contaminate bodies of water, resulting in damage to aquatic organisms. The development of nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the control of agricultural pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing their toxicological effects. Based upon this, the present study has investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate chitosan nanoparticles (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on non-target organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM, as well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity was also evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT (NP + DMT), and commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and larvae of Danio rerio (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology, and behavior. The nanoparticle control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size values of 283 +/- 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 +/- 0.05 and a zeta potential of -31 +/- 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate, the nanoparticles showed 301 +/- 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 +/- 0.02, a zeta potential of -27.9 +/- 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 +/- 0.32%, with slow-release overtime (52% after 48 h). The AFM images showed that both types of nanoparticles showed spherical morphology. Major toxic effects on embryo larval development were observed in commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the technical pesticide, predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With regard to the toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an increase for LC50-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior of the larvae was not affected. The data obtained demonstrate that nanoencapsulated dimethoate reduces the toxicity of insecticides on zebrafish larvae, suggesting that nanoencapsulation may be safer for non-target species, by eliminating collateral effects and thus promoting sustainable agriculture.",2022,27,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.impact.2022.100408,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Glyphosate herbicides such as brands of Roundup, are known to be toxic to daphnids. However, published findings on acute toxicity show significant discrepancies and variation across several orders of magnitude. To test the acute effects of both glyphosate and a commercial formulation of Roundup (hereafter Roundup), we conducted a series of exposure experiments with different clones and age-classes of D. magna. The results demonstrated EC50 (48) values in the low ppm-range for Roundup as well as for the active ingredient (a.i.) isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (glyphosate IPA) alone. Roundup showed slightly lower acute toxicity than glyphosate IPA alone, i.e. EC50 values of 3.7-10.6 mg a.i./l, as compared to 1.4-7.2 mg a.i./l for glyphosate IPA. However, in chronic toxicity tests spanning the whole life-cycle, Roundup was more toxic. D. magna was exposed to sublethal nominal concentrations of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l for 55 days. Significant reduction of juvenile size was observed even in the lowest test concentrations of 0.05 mg a.i./l, for both glyphosate and Roundup. At 0.45 mg a.i./l, growth, fecundity and abortion rate was affected, but only in animals exposed to Roundup. At 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l of both glyphosate and Roundup, significant negative effects were seen on most tested parameters, including mortality. D. magna was adversely affected by a near 100 % abortion rate of eggs and embryonic stages at 1.35 mg a.i./l of Roundup. The results indicate that aquatic invertebrate ecology can be adversely affected by relevant ambient concentrations of this major herbicide.

Since aquatic and terrestrial stages of amphibians can be exposed to these substances, adverse effects cannot be excluded. We investigated acute aquatic and terrestrial effects of the herbicide formulation Focus (R) Ultra, its active substance cycloxydim, its co-formulants solvent naphtha and docusate as well as the stabilizing adjuvant Dash (R) E.C. on larval and juvenile Rana temporaria. Aquatic toxicity was determined as 96-h LC50 values. Cycloxydim was the least toxic and solvent naphtha the most toxic substance of the formulation. The addition of Dash (R) E.C. increased the formulation toxicity substantially. Terrestrial toxicity was determined as lethal effects after a 48-h exposure to contaminated soil with 100% of the recommended field rate (FR) and as sublethal effects after the exposure to 10% of the recommended FR. The exposure to solvent naphtha and docusate at 100% FR led tomortalities of 42-100% probably due to their inhalation toxicity and dermal as well as eye irritation, respectively. Cycloxydim, Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. did not lead to any mortality. Sublethal effects on juvenile locomotor activity (i.e. moved distance) were observed for cycloxydim and the combined exposure of Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. Juvenile body masses declined significantly for all substances except for cycloxydim. The present results show that aquatic sensitivity does not predict terrestrial sensitivity. It was shown that pesticide toxicity for amphibians can highly depend on the presence and amount of co-formulants and added adjuvants. Therefore, substances included in pesticide formulations which are known to be toxic by inhalation or harmful to eyes or skin should be specifically considered in the environmental risk assessment for amphibians.

Constant usage of pesticides presents a burden for soil and causes a decrease in its health, including the negative effects on earthworms which are indicators for soil quality. The objective of this research was the assessment of the effects of two insecticides and two herbicides on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Namely, the following active ingredients and respective commercial preparations were investigated: esfenvalerate (Sumialfa), thiacloprid (Calypso), dimethenamid-p (Frontier) and prosulfocarb (Filon). Lethal concentrations (48 h) of both active ingredient and commercial preparations were determined using the filter paper contact test. Results The results showed that Calypso and Frontier were significantly more toxic than the active ingredient. Therefore, all further measurements were performed after exposure of earthworms to the commercial preparations of the pesticides. Specifically, several enzymatic biomarkers and multixenobiotic resistance activity were assessed. Additionally, a fluorescence-based assay for the determination of oxidative stress was established. Significant changes were detected for catalase, carboxylesterase and multixenobiotic activities after 48-h exposures. Also, a significant change in oxidative stress parameters could be observed for both Calypso and Frontier. Conclusions The obtained results show that commercial preparations can be more toxic than the active ingredients, and the formulations being distributed in the environment can affect earthworms on a molecular level already after short exposures. This emphasizes the importance of a more integrated eco-toxicological assessment of commercial pesticide preparations not to underestimate their effects on the environment.",2021,33,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00455-5,YES,YES,NO,OXIDATIVE STRESS,n/a

Initially, the 96-h LC50 values of AzM and GUS were estimated for two different life stages of Xenopus laevis, embryos, and tadpoles. The actual AzM concentrations in exposure media were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. Also, the sub-lethal effects of these compounds to tadpoles were determined 24 h later at exposure concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/L using selected biomarker enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotrasferase. Differences in AChE inhibition capacities of AzM and GUS were evaluated under in vitro conditions between frogs and fish in the second part of this study. The AChE activities in a pure electrical eel AChE solution and in brain homogenates of adult Cyprinus carpio, Pelophylax ridibundus, and X. laevis were assayed after in vitro exposure to 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L concentrations of AzM and GUS. According to in vivo studies AChE, CaE and GST are important biomarkers of the effect of OP exposure while CaE may be more effective in short-term, low-concentration exposures. The results of in vitro studies showed that amphibian brain AChEs were relatively more resistant to OP exposure than fish AChEs. The resistance may be the cause of the lower toxicity/lethality of OP compounds to amphibians than to fish. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Phytotoxicity assessments were conducted in the laboratory on the common green alga Selenastrum capricornutum using both the active ingredient of the herbicides and their formulated products (for MCPA and butylate). Endpoints determined after the 96 h exposure included algal population growth inhibition (IC50-cell counts), percent lethality (LC(50)-flow cytometry derived) and photosynthetic electron transport inhibition (EC(50)-fluorescence induction). Pesticide formulations had greater toxic effects than the active ingredient alone. The 96 h IC50 (50% Inhibition Concentration) and LOEC (Lowest Observable effects Concentration) using cell counts of S. capricornutum were 18.4 and 8.9 mg l(-1) respectively for MCPA-active ingredient and for MCPA-formulated, these were 0.62 and 0.0062 mg l(-1) respectively. Those for butylate-active ingredient were 61.0 and 8.3 mg l(-1) and for butylate-formulated 1.46 and 0.17 mg l(-1), respectively.

These herbicides are frequently paired with a safener, which prevents herbicidal damage to the crop without diminishing weed control. Formulated herbicide products that include safeners and other ingredients are infrequently assessed for toxicity. Our goal was to understand the potential toxicity of safeners and herbicide + safener formulations relative to the toxicity of associated active ingredients. We quantified the concentration of safeners in commercially available formulations and tested effects on nontarget algae, Raphidocelis subcapitata, when exposed to individual herbicide active ingredients, safeners, and commercial formulations. The median effective concentrations (EC50s) causing 50% reduction in population growth for the herbicide active ingredients S-metolachlor and acetochlor were 0.046 and 0.003 ppm, respectively. The safeners benoxacor, AD-67, furilazole, and dichlormid were all substantially less toxic than the herbicides and were not toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations. The commercial formulations Dual II Magnum (R), Me-Too-Lachlor II (R), Harness (R), and Surpass EC (R) all resulted in EC50 values that fell within the 95% confidence interval of the associated active ingredient herbicide. Interestingly, a significant increase in cell size was observed when algae were exposed to all the formulations, herbicides (acetochlor and S-metolachlor), and safener (dichlormid). The safener furilazole caused a significant decrease in cell size, whereas benoxacor and AD-67 had no observed effect on algae cell size. Significant algae cell size effects all occurred at or above the EC50 concentrations for each chemical, suggesting that other morphological effects may be occurring.

The technical grade cypermethrin contained 92% active ingredient (a.i.) and the commercial formulation was an emulsified concentrate (EC) containing 10% a.i. (10% EC). Based on the actual concentration in water (2 h), the commercial formulation was found to be more acutely toxic to O. niloticus (96-h LC50 = 4.85 μg/L) than the technical grade cypermethrin (96-h LC50 = 9.74 μg/L). Exposure to sub-lethal concentrations (1.25, 2.5 μg/L) of commercial cypermethrin for 96 h produced stress on the fish, which was evident from the reduction of hepatic glycogen, reduction in the activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase and catalase in liver and elevation of plasma glucose level and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Exposure to these concentrations of cypermethrin for 14–28 days produced anaemia in fish. Long-term exposure (90 days) of the fish to these concentrations reduced the growth and deposition of protein and lipid in the body of fish as compared to control.It is concluded from this study that even minute concentration (1.25 μg/L) of cypermethrin (10% EC) in water can produce stress on fish.

Flow‐through acute toxicity testing with measured concentrations of technical‐grade fenvalerate and a 30% active ingredient emulsifiable concentrate (EC) of the insecticide was conducted. Steady‐state LC50 values were reached by 72 and 120 to 168 h, respectively, in tests with technical‐grade and EC formulations of this insecticide. Initially, technical‐grade fenvalerate was more toxic; the 96–h LC50s for technical‐grade fenvalerate and the EC were 0.69 and 0.99 μg/L, respectively. By 168 h, an LC50 of 0.75 μg/L was determined for the EC, indicating that the incipient lethalities of the two formulations were similar. Fenvalerate concentration factors and residue levels in fish showed no significant differences between formulations. Residue levels associated with mortality decreased slightly with increasing fenvalerate water concentrations and ranged (mean) from approximately 1,000 to 1,500 ng/g. Levels in fish that survived testing increased with increasing exposure concentrations and ranged from about 600 to 900 ng/g. Concentration factors of 187 to 1,860 were calculated, with a mean of 1,670, as determined from fish that survived testing. The time required to accumulate residues was greater with the EC and contributed to a significantly slower uptake rate. Slower fenvalerate uptake in the presence of emulsifiers seemingly resulted in the initially lower toxicity of the EC formulation.

The objective of the present study was to assess the tolerance to glyphosate (the active ingredient and a commercial formulation) of contrasting soils with (H) and without (NH) history of exposure. The hypothesis of a higher tolerance in H soils due to a sustained selection pressure on community structure was tested through the PICT approach. Results indicated that tolerance to glyphosate is not consistent with previous history of exposure to the herbicide either for the active ingredient or for a commercial formulation. Soils of H and NH sites were also characterized in order to determine to what extent they differ in their functional diversity and structure of microbial communities.

Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) indicated some differences in respiration of specific sources but functional diversity was very similar as reflected by catabolic evenness (E). These results support PICT assay, which ideally requires soils with differences in their exposure to the contaminant but minor differences in other characteristics.

PPP regulation also demands the assessment of putative interactions among formulants within each product recipe and consequent effects, but these results are often unavailable. Such a case is that of the herbicide Winner Top (Selectis (R), Portugal), which we selected as a model commercial formulation in the present study specifically aiming at (i) characterising its aquatic toxicity towards sensitive eco-receptors (Raphidocelis subcapitata, Chlorella vulgaris, Lemna minor and Lemna gibba), as well as that of its active substances (a.s.) nicosulfuron and terbuthylazine; (ii) comparing the ecotoxicity among the commercial formulation, the corresponding mixture of its a.s. and this a.s.'s mixture increasingly enriched with the formulants. Single chemical testing revealed that terbuthylazine was the strongest microalgae growth inhibitor and nicosulfuron was the strongest macrophyte growth inhibitor. On the other hand, the commercial formulation was consistently less toxic than the corresponding mixture of the a.s., suggesting that Winner Top formulants (72.9% of the commercial formulation) interact with the a.s., promoting less than additive effects in the selected non-target species. Importantly, this environmentally protective effect of the formulation can be apparent. Because macrophytes share most physiological features with the weeds targeted by the studied herbicide, it is likely that increased application doses are required to reach desired efficacy levels with the consequent detrimental increase of PPP residues load in edge-of-field freshwater ecosystems.",2018,27,945,955,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1939-z,YES,YES,NO,n/a,"two ais but they make a representative ai mixture, with the same ai concs as the formulation.

Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max (TM) (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick (TM) (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49 mg L-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick (TM). Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period. The mobility of glyphosate in the soils proved very low thus risks to aquatic ecosystems due to application of glyphosate-based herbicides may occur rather in case of direct contamination of surface water.

For this purpose, toxicity tests were performed with the single compounds (active ingredients and commercial formulations) and their combinations (only active ingredients). According to the results, the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations to R. subcapitata was similar. In the single exposures, both carbofuran and diuron inhibited significantly the it subcapitntn growth and caused physiological (chlorophyll a content) and morphological (complexity and cell size) changes in cells, as captured by flow cytometry single-cell properties. Regarding the mixture toxicity tests, data fitted to both reference models, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and evidenced significant deviations. After the CA fitting, dose-ratio dependent deviation had the best fit to the data, demonstrating synergism caused mainly by diuron and antagonism caused mainly by carbofuran. After fitting the IA model, a synergistic deviation represented the best fit for the diuron and carbofuran mixtures. In general, the two reference models indicated the occurrence of synergism in the mixtures of these compounds, especially when diuron was the dominant chemical in the combinations. The increased toxicity caused by the mixture of these pesticides could pose a greater environmental risk for phytoplankton.

The sensitivity range of P. caudatum to reference substance sodium chloride was established. A preliminary risk assessment of diuron and carbofuran for Brazilian water bodies was performed. The tests indicated that toxicity of pure diuron and its commercial formulation was similar, while the commercial product carbofuran was more toxic than its pure form. In acute tests, readings were carried out at 2, 3, 4 and 6 h and showed an increase of mortality with increasing exposure time. The sensitivity of P. caudatum to NaCl ranged from 3.31 to 4.44 g L-1, averaging 3.88 g L-1.

For medaka exposed in static non-renewal assays to quintozene for 17 d from the fertilized egg stage to yolk resorption at the fry stage, the LC50 for mortality was a nominal concentration of 707 mu g l(-1) and the effective concentration for 50% hatch (i.e. EC50) was a nominal concentration of 71 mu g l(-1). Eggs and fry showed developmental abnormalities, including ocular malformations and retarded development of the brain, notochord, organs and body segmentation, which were interpreted as teratogenic responses to exposure to PCNB.

In this study, the toxicity of the metals Cu, Pb and Zn, the herbicide glyphosate (active product and ATANOR® formulation) and their binary combinations, was assessed on two green algae species (the standard species Raphidocelis subcapitata and a native strain of Scenedesmus acutus isolated from Burgos Stream [Buenos Aires]). The bioassays were carried out applying a concentration range of 0.5 mg L - 20 mg/L, in incubations lasting 7 days after which the algal density was estimated. To obtain the effective concentrations inhibiting 10, 20 and 50% of the growth (EC10, EC20 and EC50) of individual substances and their combinations, the percentage of growth inhibition (%I) was modeled as a function of each concentration by a nonlinear fit. According to the EC50 obtained for each species, the toxicity of Cu and Zn was higher in R. subcapitata (7.47±2.14 and 6.51±2.26 mg/L, respectively) than in S. acutus (10.90±3.75 and> 20 mg/L), while Pb and glyphosate active compound were not toxic for neither of the two strains. ATANOR® glyphosate was toxic only to R. subcapitata (EC50=12.00±3.10 mg/L). According to the EC10 and EC20 values of the individual substances and the binary combinations, S. acutus showed higher sensitivity than R. subcapitata. From the analysis of toxic units (TU), the combinatios Cu+Zn, Cu+glyphosate ATANOR® and Zn+glyphosate ATANOR® showed antagonistic effects on R. subcapitata (according to the TU values obtained from EC20 and EC50), while the Cu+Pb and Cu+Zn combinations showed synergistic and antagonistic effects, respectively, on S. acutus (according to the TU values obtained from the EC20).

This phenomenon is demonstrated in the case of the herbicide active ingredient glyphosate. Due to its extensive application, this active ingredient was found in surface and ground water samples collected in Bks County, Hungary, in the concentration range of 0.540.98 ng/ml. The occurrence of glyphosate appeared to be somewhat higher at areas under intensive agriculture, industrial activities and public road services, but the compound was detected at areas under organic (ecological) farming or natural grasslands, indicating environmental mobility. Increased toxicity of the formulated herbicide product Roundup compared to that of glyphosate was observed on the indicator aquatic organism Daphnia magna Straus. Acute LC50 values of Roundup and its formulating adjuvant polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA) exceeded 20 and 3.1 _g/ml, respectively, while that of glyphosate (as isopropyl salt) was found to be substantially lower (690-900 _g/ml) showing good agreement with literature data. Cytotoxicity of Roundup, POEA and glyphosate has been determined on the neuroectodermal cell line, NE-4C measured both by cell viability test and holographic microscopy. Acute toxicity (LC50) of Roundup, POEA and glyphosate on NE-4C cells was found to be 0.0130.002%, 0.0170.009% and 6.462.25%, respectively (in equivalents of diluted Roundup solution), corresponding to 0.0220.003 and 53.118.5 mg/ml for POEA and glyphosate, respectively, indicating no statistical difference between Roundup and POEA and 2.5 orders of magnitude difference between these and glyphosate.

An herbicide (Montana (R)) and fungicide (Bravo500 (R)) formulations were investigated and results were compared to the isolated active substances of each formulation (glyphosate and chlorothalonil, respectively). Tests were performed using the invertebrate Folsomia candida as test species and an agricultural natural soil. Degradation rate tests were determined under aerobic conditions at 20 +/- 2 degrees C, using an ecologically relevant concentration of 5 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) of soil for both chemicals. Results demonstrated degradation half-lives (DT50) of 2.2 days forMontana (R) and 2.8 days when pure glyphosate was tested. Values of 1.1 and 2.9 days were registered for Bravo500 (R) and its active substance chlorothalonil, respectively. There were no effects on survival for the tested concentrations of both forms of the herbicide (up to 17.3 mg kg(-1)). However, reproduction was affected, but only by the herbicide formulation, with an estimated EC50 value of 4.63 mg (a.i.) kg(-1). Effects were most unlikely related to glyphosate. For chlorothalonil, both tested forms affected survival and reproduction.

For this reason elevated concentrations are expected in aquatic environment. Despite this fact, there is still a lack of data available on its possible risk for the environment. In this study, the potential hazards of imidacloprid and its commercial product Confidor SL 200 to aquatic environment were identified by the acute and chronic toxicity assessment using bacteria Vibrio fischeri, algae Desmodesmus subspicatus, crustacean Daphnia magna, fish Danio, rerio and the ready biodegradability determination. We found out, that imidacloprid was not highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial product. Imidacloprid was found persistent in water samples and not readily biodegradable in aquatic environment. Due to increased future predicted use of commercial products containing imidacloprid and the findings of this work, we recommend additional toxicity and biodegradability studies of other commercial products with imidacloprid as an active constituent.

The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of commercially available household pesticides to that of the active ingredient(s) alone. The toxicity of five household pesticides (three herbicides and two insecticides) was investigated using a bacterial cytotoxicity bioassay and an algal photosynthesis bioassay. The commercial products were up to an order of magnitude more toxic than the active ingredient(s) alone. In addition, two commercial products with the same listed active ingredients in the same ratio had a 600 x difference in potency. These results clearly demonstrate that additives in commercial formulations are significant contributors to the toxicity of household pesticides. The toxicity of pesticides in aquatic systems is therefore likely underestimated by conventional chemical monitoring and risk assessment when only the active ingredients are considered. Regulators and customers should require more clarity from pesticide manufacturers about the nature and concentrations of not only the active ingredients, but also additives used in commercial formulations.

Individual toxicity tests showed that C. silvestrii was more sensitive to both carbofuran and diuron than P. caudatum. In single exposures, both pesticides caused adverse effects to C. silvestrii in environmentally relevant concentrations (48 h EC50 = 0.001 mg L-1 and 8 d LOEC = 0.00038 mg L-1 for formulated carbofuran; 8 d LOEC < 0.05 mg L-1 for formulated diuron).

Acute and chronic exposures to diuron and carbofuran mixtures caused significant deviations of the toxicity predicted by the Concentration Addition and Independent Action reference models for both test species. For the protozoan P. caudatum, a dose-dependent deviation was verified for mortality, with synergism caused mainly by carbofuran and antagonism caused mainly by diuron. For protozoan population growth, however, an antagonistic deviation was observed when the active ingredient mixtures were tested. In the case of C. silvestrii, antagonism at low concentrations and synergism at high concentrations were revealed after acute exposure to active ingredient mixtures, whereas for reproduction an antagonistic deviation was found. Commercial formulation mixtures presented significantly higher toxicity than the active ingredient mixtures.

Pregnant animals were exposed to increasing doses of the herbicide (0.01, 0.1 and 100 mg/kg/d) during gestation days 0-9, after which animals were euthanized and their blood analyzed for catalase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Number of corpora lutea and uterine implantations and resorptions were also determined. Herbicide exposure did not cause any overt signs of maternal toxicity at any of the doses administered; neither did it cause an effect on developmental parameters. Catalase activity and TBARs were not modified by herbicide exposure although TAC was significantly decreased at 100 mg/kg/d of both pure and formulated compound. Thus, 2,4-D does not seem to induce oxidative stress during early pregnancy in mice at the doses administered, indicating that this mechanism is probably not involved in mediating herbicide toxicity at these dose levels. Furthermore, since no manifestations of developmental toxicity were observed after administration of the herbicide, it is also possible that 2,4-D may not produce any early developmental toxicity at the low environmentally relevant doses tested in this animal model.

Nanosized encapsulated pesticides offer a variety of enhanced features including controlled release and improved efficacy. Despite the presence of nanosized capsules in current-use pesticide formulations, the analytical and toxicological implications of encapsulation are uncertain. To explore this issue quantitatively, we fractionated the capsules of a commercially available encapsulated insecticide formulation (γ-cyhalothrin active ingredient) into two size ranges: a large fraction (LF), with an average hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) of 758 nm, and a small fraction (SF), with an average HDD of 449 nm. We developed a novel extraction method demonstrating a time-dependent inhibition of γ-cyhalothrin from capsules for up to 48 h. An acute immobilization test with a freshwater macroinvertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia) revealed that the SF was significantly more toxic than both the LF and the free γ-cyhalothrin treatment (EC50 = 0.18 µg/L, 0.57 µg/L, and 0.65 µg/L, respectively). These findings highlight that encapsulation of γ-cyhalothrin mitigates hydrophobic partitioning in a time-dependent manner and influences toxicity in a size-dependent manner. Recognizing the analytical and toxicological nuances of various nanosized capsules can contribute to innovation in pesticide formulations and may lead to more comprehensive pesticide regulation. © 2019 by the authors.

Carefully designed and un-confounded laboratory toxicity tests are crucial for accurate assessment of potential risks from the original formulation of Roundup ® to North American amphibians in aquatic environments. The formulated mixture of this herbicide as well as its components, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate and the surfactant MON 0818 (containing polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA)) were separately tested in 96h acute toxicity tests with Gosner stage 25 larval anurans. Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo fowleri, and Hyla chrysoscelis were reared from egg masses and exposed to a series of 11 concentrations of the original formulation of Roundup ® herbicide, nine concentrations of MON 0818 and three concentrations of IPA salt of glyphosate in static (non-renewal) aqueous laboratory tests. LC50 values are expressed as glyphosate acid equivalents (ae) or as mg/L for MON 0818 concentrations for comparison between the formulation and components. R. pipiens was the most sensitive of five species with 96h-LC50 values for formulation tests, for the five species, ranging from 1.80 to 4.22mg ae/L, and MON 0818 exposures with 96h-LC50 values ranging from 0.68 to 1.32mg/L. No significant mortality was observed during exposures of 96h for any of the five species exposed to glyphosate IPA salt at concentrations up to 100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). These results agree with previous studies which have noted that the surfactant MON 0818 containing POEA contributes the majority of the toxicity to the herbicide formulations for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and amphibians.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations. In summary, combining an active ingredient with a custom synergist appears to be a very promising approach for the development of effective new insecticide products.",2016,64,5148,5155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01512,YES,YES,NO,n/a,this is investigating a synergist so I don't think this should be included.

Adverse effects were analyzed by means of the isotoxicity curves for lethality, malformations, stage-dependent susceptibility, and ultrastructural features. For all experimental conditions, the CF was more toxic, up to 10 times, than the active ingredient, being the open mouth stage (S. 21) the most susceptible to the herbicide. For continuous treatment conditions, the early embryonic development was the most susceptible to 2,4-D and the LC50s for 96 and 168 h were 9.06 and 7.76 mg L(-1) respectively. In addition, both the active ingredient and the CF were highly teratogenic, resulting in reduced body size, delayed development, microcephaly, agenesis of gills, and abnormal cellular proliferation processes as the main adverse effects. According to US EPA, 2,4-D in agricultural scenarios may be up to three times higher than the NOEC values for teratogenic effects reported in this study. Therefore, they might represent a risk for amphibians. This study also points out the relevance of reporting the susceptibility of embryos at different developmental stages to both the active ingredient and the CF of agrochemicals in order to protect nontarget organisms.

Commercial insecticide formulations, however, contain a significant proportion (>90%) of so-called inert ingredients, which may alter the toxicity of the active ingredient(s). This study compares the sublethal toxicity of two insecticides, the pyrethroid bifenthrin, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil, to their commercial formulations, Talstar (R) and Termidor (R). Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff. We used larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), to determine effects on growth and swimming performance after short-term (24 h) exposure to sublethal concentrations of pure insecticides and the respective formulations. Significantly enhanced 7 d growth was observed at 10% of the 24 h LC10 (53 mu g L-1) fipronil. Swimming performance was significantly impaired at 20% of the 24 h LC10 (0.14 mu g L-1) of bifenthrin and 10% of the 24 h LC10 of Talstare (0.03 mu g L-1). Fipronil and Termidor led to a significant impairment of swimming performance at 142 mu g L-1 and 148 mu g L-1 respectively, with more pronounced effects for the formulation. Our data shows that based on dissolved concentrations both formulations were more toxic than the pure active ingredients, suggesting that increased toxicity due to inert ingredients should be considered in risk assessments and regulation of insecticides.

The 2,4-D (salt) was shown to be less toxic to C. vernalis than reported toxicity for Lepomis macrochirus. 3) The toxicity of the commercial formulations was not dependent on the active ingredient content. Amitrole-T with 20 percent active ingredient proved to be more toxic than reagent grade amitrole. The alkanolamine salt of 2,4-D was less toxic than 2,4-D (free acid) to an extent much greater than could be expected from the examination of the acid equivalent of 2,4-D (salt). 4) Each of the herbicides examined apparently exhibited more than one mode of toxic action.

Synchronous with breeding events (May-July), embryos and tadpoles were exposed, in situ and in the laboratory, to study site pond water for 2 to 3 weeks. Six pesticides commonly applied in apple orchards (Guthion(R) 50WP, Imidan(R) 50WP, Thiodan(R) 50WP, Dithane(R) DG, Nova(R) 40W, and Basudin(R) 500EC) and technical grade diazinon were also evaluated for direct toxicity to green frogs using continuous and discontinuous toxicity tests. Embryos and larvae exhibited poor hatching success and survival at some orchard sites during in situ assays, but no specific water source produced consistently poor developmental success. Reduced tadpole growth occurred at several study sites, showing no clear distinction between reference and orchard sites. Despite the collection of substantial environmental data, only surface water temperature appeared to be correlated with growth rates. Basudin 500EC, technical grade diazinon, and Dithane DG caused mortality, deformities, or growth inhibition during early development at environmentally relevant concentrations (<0.01 mg/L), whereas Imidan 50WP, Guthion 50WP, and Nova 40W produced survival or growth effects at much higher levels (5-10 mg/L). Dithane DG (mancozeb) was acutely toxic during prolonged exposures, and sublethal growth and deformity responses occurred at nominal concentrations greater than 0.01 mg/L. Diazinon was the most toxic to green frogs, with median lethal concentrations of 2.8 to 5 mu g/L and median effective concentrations of 6 to 14 mu g/L for formulation and technical grades, respectively.

Acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP (15 μg/mL) and POEA (45 μg/mL) reduced (p < 0.001) lifespan of female flies compared to untreated controls or glyphosate (100 μg/mL). Negative geotaxis responses in female flies were reduced (p < 0.05) following acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA whereas glyphosate did not significantly affect this response compared to untreated flies. Acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA elevated (p < 0.05) protein carbonyl levels while markedly (p < 0.01) inhibiting carbonyl reductase activity whereas glyphosate treatment did not significantly affect protein carbonyl levels or carbonyl reductase activity. Fecundity was reduced (p < 0.05) following exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA whereas glyphosate did not affect fecundity.

Chronic toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC on P. roseola survival and fecundity were also studied. The sensitivity of P. roseola to K2Cr2O7 ranged from 29.52 to 64.67 mg L-1, averaging 47.10 mg L-1. The 48-h EC50 were 13.36 +/- 2.63 mg L-1 for carbofuran and 89.32 +/- 6.52 mg L-1 for commercial form. Chronic toxicity tests showed that the survival of this rotifer was not affected by the carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC at the concentrations tested and that at 1.56 and 3.12 mg L-1 their fecundity was higher than in the absence of this commercial product, characterizing the hormesis phenomenon. The sensitivity profile of several species to carbofuran indicated that P. roseola is more susceptible to this pesticide than the fish Clarias batrachus, the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, although the acute toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC to P. roseola is much lower than that of active ingredient carbofuran.

Despite a number of recent studies examining the effects of glyphosate on amphibians, very few have aimed to understand the toxicological effects of glyphosate in combination with surfactants as it is commonly applied in the field. Land managers interested in making pesticide choices based on minimizing impacts to nontarget wildlife are hindered by a lack of published toxicity data. Short-term acute toxicity trials were conducted for glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt (IPA) alone and mixed with 2 surfactants: Agri-dex and Competitor with western toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] boreas) tadpoles. Glyphosate IPA mixed with Competitor was 6 times more toxic than glyphosate IPA mixed with Agri-dex, and both mixtures were more toxic than glyphosate IPA alone. The median lethal concentrations reported for 24-h and 48-h exposures were 8279mg/L (24h) and 6392mg/L (48h) for glyphosate IPA alone; 5092mg/L (24h) and 4254mg/L (48h) for glyphosate IPA mixed with Agri-dex; and 853mg/L (24h) and 711mg/L (48h) for glyphosate IPA mixed with Competitor.

For F. candida, acetamiprid and imidacloprid had different toxicities, with acetamiprid being 4 times more toxic to survival (median lethal concentration [LC50] 0.12 mg active substance [a.s.]/kg dry soil) and imidacloprid being 4 times more toxic to reproduction of the springtail (median effect concentration [EC50] 0.25 mg a.s./kg dry soil) than their commercial formulations. The most toxic compound to E. andrei was acetamiprid (LC50 0.80 and EC50 0.35-0.40 mg a.s./kg), and the most toxic to F. candida was clothianidin (LC50 0.07 and EC50 0.05 mg a.s./kg). Estimated risk ratios indicated that only one application/yr of clothianidin in the formulation Poncho (R) may pose a threat to the populations of springtails and earthworms.

The 96‐h LC50s for technical dinoseb were 0.058 mg/L for channel catfish and 0.088 mg/L for fathead minnows. Differences among Vertac General®, Vertac Selective®, Premerge 3®, Gebutox® and technical dinoseb did not affect dinoseb toxicity to either fish species. The 96‐h LC50s for technical MSMA were 2,390 mg/L for channel catfish and 1,210 mg/L for fathead minnows. Formulation had a measurable effect on MSMA toxicity, with the Daconate® and Daconate 6® formulations nearly an order of magnitude more toxic than technical MSMA and Bueno 6® to both fish species. The mixture or joint toxicity of technical dinoseb and technical MSMA was greater than additive (synergistic), with additive toxicity indices for channel catfish and fathead minnows of 0.51 and 5.78, respectively.

Toxicity studies have been performed for each herbicide individually, but there is a dearth of information concerning the toxicity of these herbicides in a mixture. The following study examined the toxicity of a mixture of these two herbicides in the red swamp crawfish, Procambarus clarkii. 96-hour acute toxicity assays were performed to determine whether surfactant significantly altered the toxicity of these herbicides individually or in combination. Markings additive index was calculated to identify the interactions of the herbicide mixture. Surfactant was observed to significantly increase the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the toxicity of the herbicide mixture. The herbicide mixture alone displayed half the toxicity of the individual herbicides, but the mixture with surfactant was twice as toxic as the individual herbicides. The synergistic action of surfactant may be attributed to increased pesticide absorption across biological membranes. 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and surfactant may also compromise gill function, increasing the sensitivity of the crawfish to herbicide toxicity. The antagonistic effects of the herbicide mixture in the absence of surfactant may be caused by competition of both herbicides for the same sites of activity.",2004,1,35,38,10.3390/ijerph2004010035,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Similar tests with ringed turtledoves (Streptopelia risoria) were conducted with five of the granular formulations to check for interspecific differences. The test chemicals were Amaze 15G (isofenphos), Counter 15G (terbufos), Dasanit 15G (fensulfothion), Diazinon 14G (diazinon), Di-Syston 15G (disulfoton), Dyfonate 20G (fonofos), Furadan 10G (carbofuran), Lorsban 15G (chlorpyrifos), Nemacur 15G (fenamiphos), Parathion 10G (parathion), Tattoo 10G (bendiocarb), Temik 15G (aldicarb), and Thimet 15G (phorate). Information is also presented on dose-response relations and their use in hazard assessment, granule size and hazard, response patterns, and toxic signs. The general conclusions were: (1) The organophosphates (fenamiphos and fensulfothion) and the carbamate (aldicarb) were the most toxic of the insecticides tested. (2) The granular formulation and its technical grade active ingredient were of equivalent toxicity, or the granular was significantly less toxic. (3) The dose-response curve enhances hazard assessment. (4) Ingestion of a single granule of Temik 15G was shown to be life threatening to bobwhite-sized birds, and ingestion of fewer than five granules could be lethal to sparrow-sized birds for Dasanit 15G, Diazinon 14G, Dyfonate 20G, Furadan 15G, and Nemacur 15G. (5) It is therefore suggested that the hazard associated with granular insecticides may be more dependent on which species (cf. size and feeding behavior) inhabit a treated area than on the actual application rate. © 1984.",1984,8,551,563,10.1016/0147-6513(84)90015-0,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Acute toxicity (48 h) and 21 d population studies were conducted. The hypothesis of this study was that these two compounds would have different toxicities. We conducted acute and chronic toxicity studies for each compound and compared the results to test this hypothesis. 48 h LC50s (95% CL) for chlorantraniliprole and Altacor(R) were 8.5 (6.6-11.5) and 6.0 (3.7-9.0) mu g chlorantraniliprole/L water, respectively. Therefore, chlorantraniliprole and Altacor(R) were equitoxic to C. dubia at LC50 based on overlap of the 95% CL. In the population study, chlorantraniliprole and Altacor(R) concentrations equivalent to the acute LC5, 10, 25, and 50 for each product were evaluated on populations of C. dubia. Number of individuals after 21 d was the endpoint evaluated. T-tests conducted at each LC value indicated that there was no significant difference in population size between these two products at each LC value evaluated. Previous studies show that toxicity can vary greatly between formulated and technical grade pesticides.

Different formulations using the same active ingredient are frequently available, which raises the issue of potential influence of different formulation types on herbicide toxicity. The present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampe (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the way of active substance release. This investigation is the first report on zebrafish embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The technical active ingredient and formulations caused mortality and diverse teratogenic effects, showing different levels of toxicity. The LC50 values for the technical ingredient, Rampa (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS were 61.4, 9.6 and 92.5 mg a.i./l, respectively. Spontaneous movements in 22 hpf embryos decreased under exposure to both the technical ingredient and formulations. A significant number of underdeveloped embryos was detected after exposure to clomazone and Rampe EC, while no underdevelopment was noted in embryos exposed to GAT Cenit 36 CS. Exposure to the technical ingredient and formulations led also to a series of morphological changes and interfered with the growth of zebrafish embryos. The EC50 based on detection of edemas, spine and tail tip deformations and gas bladder absence (120 hpf) was 12.1, 10.1 and 24.1 mg/l for technical clomazone, Rampe EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, while teratogenicity index (TI) based on LC50/EC50 ratio was 5.1, 1 and 3.8, respectively. The data in this study showed that the emulsifiable concentrate formulation (Rampa. EC) caused statistically significantly higher toxicity, and the aqueous capsule suspension (GAT Cenit 36 CS) lower toxicity than technical clomazone.

Risk assessments are usually based on the pure active ingredient and not on the formulated products applied in the environment. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how azoxystrobin, the best-selling strobilurin fungicide, affects non-target soil organisms Enchytraeus albidus. To investigate the effects of the different types of azoxystrobin, E. albidus was exposed to the pure active ingredient, AZO_AI, and the formulated product, AZO_FP. Survival, reproduction, and molecular biomarkers of E. albidus were determined for different exposure durations (seven and 21 days). AZO_FP (LC50 = 15.3 mg(a.i.)/kg) showed a slightly stronger effect on survival than AZO_AI (LC50 = 16.8 mg(a.i.)/kg), yet the impact on reproduction was much stronger. Namely, while the tested concentrations of AZO_AI (EC50 >= 8 mg(a.i.)/kg) had almost no effect on reproduction, AZO_FP (EC50 = 2.9 mg(a.i.)/kg) significantly inhibited reproduction in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase) and malondialdehyde levels in both treatments indicated oxidative stress. Although AZO_FP had a stronger negative effect, the impact depended on the exposure time and the tested concentration. The higher toxicity of AZO_FP was a consequence of increased bioavailability and activity of the active ingredient due to the presence of adjuvants. Overall stronger adverse effects of AZO_FP suggest that the toxicity of azoxystrobin in the agricultural environment on the enchytraeid population may be underestimated. Furthermore, the results of this study highlighted the importance of comparing the toxicity of the active ingredient and the formulated product.",2022,187,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.105198,YES,YES,NO,REPRODUCTION,n/a

For R. clamitans, acute toxicity values in order of decreasing toxicity were POEA > Roundup Original > Roundup Transorb® > Glyfos AU®; no significant acute toxicity was observed with glyphosate technical material or the glyphosate formulations Roundup Biactive®, Touchdown®, or Glyfos BIO®. Comparisons between the four amphibian species showed that the toxicity of Roundup Original varied with species and developmental stage. Rana pipiens tadpoles chronically exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of POEA or glyphosate formulations containing POEA showed decreased snout-vent length at metamorphosis and increased time to metamorphosis, tail damage, and gonadal abnormalities. These effects may be caused, in some part, by disruption of hormone signaling, because thyroid hormone receptor β mRNA transcript levels were elevated by exposure to formulations containing glyphosate and POEA.

Fenvalerate and esfenvalerate were both highly toxic to larval rainbow fish with 1-h esfenvalerate pulse-exposure concentrations as low as 0.32 μg l-1, and 1-min fenvalerate pulse-exposure concentrations of 4.5 μg l-1, sufficient to cause significant mortality. Technical grades were significantly more toxic than emulsified grades of the pesticides. The 1-h pulse-exposure 96-h LC50's were 12.75, 30.25, 1.18, and 1.99 μg l-1 for technical fenvalerate, emulsified fenvalerate, technical esfenvalerate, and emulsified esfenvalerate, respectively. Emulsified fenvalerate and esfenvalerate were also extremely toxic to adult crimson-spotted rainbow fish. The 96-h continuous exposure LC50's for adult fish using 50% daily partial replacement were 14.58 and 6.24 μg l-1, respectively, comparable with results for holarctic species. Fenvalerate is a racemic mixture containing four optical isomers (2R, aR; 2R, aS; 2S, aR, 2S, aS), while esfenvalerate contains mainly the 2S isomers. Esfenvalerate contains approximately twice the quantity of 2S isomers as does fenvalerate on a weight basis. Pulse-exposure LC50's for esfenvalerate were 10 to 15 times lower than for fenvalerate, a much higher toxicity of esfenvalerate than the roughly two fold difference which would have been predicted solely on a weight basis. Thus the 2R isomers, which make up approximately 50% of the fenvalerate formulation and which previously were regarded as non-active, appear to have reduced the expected toxicity of fenvalerate relative to measured esfenvalerate toxicity, perhaps via the inhibition of sodium channel activation. There was a complex relationship between pesticide concentration and time to mortality. At low concentrations of pesticide, most mortality occurred within the first 24 h, while at higher concentrations, mortality continued for 96 h after exposure. This suggests that mortality within the first 24 h was due to direct physiological effects of the pesticide on the larvae, while subsequent mortality was primarily due to starvation of larvae unable to recover from the initial insult. Duration of exposure (0 to 120 min) to emulsified fenvalerate and esfenvalerate significantly affected the acute toxicity to larval rainbow fish. For esfenvalerate, there was a linear relationship between duration of exposure and acute toxicity, while for fenvalerate, exposures of longer than 20 min did not significantly increase 96-h mortality. © 1994.",1994,28,169,187,10.1016/0166-445X(94)90032-9,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Acute toxicities for Roundup ranged from 2.3 mg/L (96-h LC50, fathead minnow) to 43 mg/L (48-h EC50, mature scuds). Toxicities of the surfactant were similar to those of the Roundup formulation. Technical glyphosate was considerably less toxic than Roundup or the surfactant; for midge larvae, the 48-h EC50 was 55 mg/L and for rainbow trout, the 96-h LC50 was 140 mg/L. Roundup was more toxic to rainbow trout and bluegills at the higher test temperatures, and at pH 7.5 than at pH 6.5. Toxicity did not increase at pH 8.5 or 9.5. Eyed eggs were the least sensitive life stage, but toxicity increased markedly as the fish entered the sac fry and early swim-up stages. No changes in fecundity or gonadosomatic index were observed in adult rainbow trout treated with the isopropylamine salt or Roundup up to 2.0 mg/L. The aging of Roundup test solutions for seven days did not reduce toxicity to midge larvae, rainbow trout or bluegills. In avoidance studies, rainbow trout did not avoid concentrations of the isopropylamine salt up to 10.0 mg/L; mayfly nymphs avoided 10.0 mg/L of Roundup, but not 1.0 mg/L. In a simulated field application, midge larvae avoided 2.0 mg/L of Roundup. Application of Roundup, at recommended rates, along ditchbank areas of irrigation canals should not adversely affect resident populations of fish or invertebrates. However, spring applications in lentic situations, where dissolved oxygen levels are low or temperatures are elevated, could be hazardous to young-of-the-year-fishes. © 1979 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",1979,8,269,278,10.1007/BF01056243,YES,YES,NO,FECUNDITY,n/a

The 24-h sediment test yielded an LC50 value of 16.12 mu g/L (95% CI: 14.79-17.57 mu g/L) for adult shrimp, and 14.16 mu g/L (95% CI: 12.21-16.43 mu g/L) for larvae. Adjusted LC50 values to reflect the 18% resmethrin concentration in Scourge((R)) are 0.37 mu g/L (adult), 0.07 mu g/L (larvae) for the 96-h aqueous test, and 2.90 mu g/L (adult), 2.6 mu g/L (larvae) for the 24-h sediment test. Larval grass shrimp were more sensitive to technical resmethrin and Scourges than the adult life stage. The results also demonstrate that synergized resmethrin is more toxic to P. pugio than the nonsynergized form, and that the presence of sediment decreases the toxicity of both resmethrin and Scourges.",2005,40,585,594,10.1081/PFC-200061552,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Like other agrochemicals, imazethapyr is commercialized in formulations containing a mixture of additives that increase the effectiveness of the active ingredient. These complex mixtures may cause adverse effects on non-target primary producers, such as microalgae, when they reach freshwater bodies. The aim of this study was to assess the effects, separately, of the formulation Verosil(R), the formulation additives, and technical-grade imazethapyr, in the acidic form or as ammonium salt, on the microalga Scenedesmus vacuolatus (Chlorophyta). Verosil(R), formulation additives, and acid imazethapyr significantly inhibited the growth of S. vacuolatus (Verosil(R) > formulation additives > acid imazethapyr) and caused morphological alterations from 2 mg L-1, 4 mg L-1, and 60 mg L-1 onwards, respectively. Verosil(R) and formulation additives caused the most adverse effect including membrane disorganization, cytoplasm contraction, cell wall thickening, thylakoidal membrane disaggregation, and starch granule accumulation. In addition, Verosil(R) and formulation additives increased the chl a/chl b ratio, indicating possible alterations in photosystems as a stress response. The carotene/chl a ratio was also increased in microalgae exposed to both Verosil(R) and formulation additives, suggesting an antioxidant response to these toxic compounds. All these results support the hypothesis that the formulation additives contribute significantly to the toxicity and alterations caused by the commercial formulation Verosil(R) on S. vacuolatus.",2022,29,31384,31399,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17962-w,YES,YES,NO,MORPHOLOGY,n/a
coxref2,Guy,YES,"Garcia-Ortega, S; Holliman, PJ; Jones, DL",toxicology and fate of pestanal (r) and commercial propetamphos formulations in river and estuarine sediment,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"To quantify the impact of organophosphate pesticides on aquatic ecosystems requires a mechanistic understanding of their behaviour in a range of environmental matrices. The objective of this study was to compare the sorption/desorption, biodegradation and toxic effects of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulation (Ectomort Centenary) of the organophosphate insecticide propetamphos in river and estuarine sediments. For both formulations, the sorption of propetamphos onto sediment was initially very rapid followed by a slower sorption phase. Similarly, the initial rate of desorption was rapid, followed by a much slower rate. In both sorption and desorption experiments, the level of sorbed propetamphos was considerably higher for the commercial formulation of propetamphos (K-d = 7-11) than for the Pestanal (R) grade (K-d = 4-10). The rate of propetamphos biodegradation was sediment dependent but was most rapid where microbial activity and nutrients were the highest and sorption was the lowest. Propetamphos was more rapidly degraded in sediments under aerobic (t(1/2)=15 d) compared to anaerobic conditions (t(1/2) = 19 d). However, no significant difference in the biodegradation rates of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulations of propetamphos were observed. The toxic effect of propetamphos on sediment microbial communities was significantly greater for the commercial formulation than for the Pestanal (R) grade of propetamphos based on EC50 (21 versus 236 mu g g(-1)) and EC10 values (0.3 versus 54 mu g g(-1)). In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of using commercial pesticide formulations when carrying out ecotoxicological testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

wos43,Guy,YES,"Contardo-Jara, V; Gessner, MO",uptake and physiological effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and its commercial formulation confidor (r) in a widespread freshwater oligochaete,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The neonicotinoid imidacloprid (IMI) is one of the most extensively applied neuro-active insecticides worldwide and continues to enter surface waters in many countries despite a recent ban for outdoor use in the EU. Yet little is known about ecotoxicological effects on non-target benthic freshwater species exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IMI and its marketed products. The aim of the present study was to narrow this gap by assessing effects of pure IMI and its commercial formulation Confidor (R) on the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, a key species in freshwater sediments. To this end, we determined dose-response relationships in 24 h toxicity tests, bioconcentration during 24 h and 5 d of exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g IMI L-1, and physiological stress responses by measuring glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase activity in the same conditions. Maximum neonicotinoid concentrations reported from the field were lethal to L. variegatus within 24 h (LC50 of 65 and 88 mu g IMI L-1 in pure form and as active ingredient of Confidor (R), respectively). At sub-lethal exposure concentrations, tissue content of IMI significantly increased with exposure time. The observed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were far above the water octanol coefficient (K-OW), indicating a potentially large underestimation of IMI bioaccumulation when based on K-OW. Activities of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes indicated attempts of L. variegatus to counter xenobiotic-triggered oxidative stress to very low IMI and Confidor (R) concentrations. Together, our data add significantly to growing evidence that the continued proliferation of neonicotinoids require increased efforts in environmental risk assessment, especially in view of species-specific differences in sensitivities to the insecticide and possibly to additives of commercial formulations.

wos248,Guy,YES,"Pereira, JL; Mendes, CD; Goncalves, F",acute and chronic effects of a mixture of formulated pesticides and its corresponding active ingredients in daphnia magna,FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,"Agricultural practices worldwide include the use of pesticides either as single-chemical or multiple-chemical applications aiming higher efficiency in controlling grass weeds and animal pests. Pesticides may easily reach and contaminate surface waterbodies mainly through drainage 7 and spray drift, and hence are currently viewed as a major contamination issue. Following recent discussion on the ability of adjuvant chemicals added to marketed formulations to contribute for pesticide toxicity, this study focuses the acute and chronic toxicity of the insecticide Lannate (R) and the herbicide Stam Novel Flo (R), as well as that of their active ingredients Methomyl and Propanil, to the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna. Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients. Chronic exposures can provide additional information on chemicals' toxicity in reproductive endpoints, which is of particular relevance when considering that pesticides are often repeatedly applied within a single agricultural season. Life-history endpoints assessed under mixture exposures indeed indicated higher Iona-term. 17 C, than short-term toxicity, and showed a distinct pattern of joint action when compared to acute toxicity assessments. These results suggest that long-term exposures can provide relevant complementary information on mixtures' toxicity that should be taken into account within pesticide risk assessment procedures.",2009,18,1281,1288,NA,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

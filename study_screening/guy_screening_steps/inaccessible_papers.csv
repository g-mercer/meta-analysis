Pesticides may easily reach and contaminate surface waterbodies mainly through drainage 7 and spray drift, and hence are currently viewed as a major contamination issue. Following recent discussion on the ability of adjuvant chemicals added to marketed formulations to contribute for pesticide toxicity, this study focuses the acute and chronic toxicity of the insecticide Lannate (R) and the herbicide Stam Novel Flo (R), as well as that of their active ingredients Methomyl and Propanil, to the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna. Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients. Chronic exposures can provide additional information on chemicals' toxicity in reproductive endpoints, which is of particular relevance when considering that pesticides are often repeatedly applied within a single agricultural season. Life-history endpoints assessed under mixture exposures indeed indicated higher Iona-term. 17 C, than short-term toxicity, and showed a distinct pattern of joint action when compared to acute toxicity assessments. These results suggest that long-term exposures can provide relevant complementary information on mixtures' toxicity that should be taken into account within pesticide risk assessment procedures.",2009,18,1281,1288,NA,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,paper not accessible,YES,PAPER

Adjuvants are used in conjunction with 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and other herbicides. Earlier pesticide applier survey results (n = 709) show that 59% of the applicators used adjuvants, and the majority of this group used paraffinic oils and/or surfactant mixtures. As a beginning effort to explore the role of adjuvants and herbicides in hormonally based reproductive effects, a prospective, controlled study was performed to analyze blood specimens from three different exposure groups (applicators using herbicides only; applicators using both herbicides and insecticides; and applicators using fumigants in addition to herbicides and insecticides; and a control group composed of other agricultural workers including organic farmers). The applicators and controls were age- and smoking-matched. Study subjects (n = 78) were tested before, during, and after completion of pesticide application season for the effects of pesticide products on hormone levels in the bloodstream. Of the applicator exposure groups examined, only the herbicide group showed significant endocrinologic differences from controls. Free testosterone levels were significantly elevated in post-season measurements (p = 0.032), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was significantly decreased at the height of the season (p = 0.016) and in the post-season (p = 0.010) as compared to controls. These endocrinologic findings are discussed in terms of their possible relationship to potential endocrine effects of herbicides, herbicide contaminants, and adjuvants. In vitro genotoxicity examination compared four different commercially available surfactant mixtures with 12 different commercial herbicide products, including six different chlorophenoxy herbicides. Only one herbicide yielded a significant dose-response curve. All four adjuvants showed positive dose-response effects. These preliminary data suggest that adjuvants are not inert but are toxicologically active components added to herbicide mixtures. Whether adjuvant toxicant effects are additive or are independent of herbicide effects is poorly understood.",1999,15,159,167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/074823399678846619,NO,NO,NO,GENOTOXICITY,not accessible.

This means that nanoformulations aim to comply with the safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) concept, as a part of (re)designing to reduce their risks. However, the toxic effects of nanoformulations, particularly to non-target organisms, are poorly known, and even more so at the mechanistic level. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of toxicity of atrazine when delivered as a nanoformulation of atrazine (nano_ATZ), a commercial atrazine-based formulation (Gesaprim), and the pure a.i. (ATZ). A high-throughput gene expression microarray (4 x 44 K) was used to assess transcriptomics in Enchytraeus crypticus (non-target species). Organisms were exposed, in soil, to equitoxic reproduction effect concentrations (EC10 and EC50) for 3 and 7 days. Results showed activation of genes involved in both general and well-known mechanisms of detoxification (e.g. cytochrome P450 and GST) for all the atrazine forms. Unique effects of nano_ATZ on transcripts linked to secretion, translocation and vesicle trafficking suggested that differentiated - nano-specific - uptake and/or cellular transport might be taking place. This study on the transcriptomics of a nanoformulation, the first so far, suggested differentiated mechanisms of toxicity among the nanoformulation, the a.i. and the conventional pesticides, shedding light on the issues of safe and sustainable-by-design (SSbD) for the agrochemical industry.",2022,9,2182,2194,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1en00735a,NO,NO,NO,TRANSCRIPTOMICS,not accessible.

Technical grade and commercially formulated pesticides were used, the commercial excipient and its main hydrocarbon constituent (xylene) were also tested. Eggs were treated either directly by intravitelline injection (1.25 mg, 0.80 mg or 0.30 mg of active substance by egg) or spraying of the shell (with a 2% aqueous suspension of pesticide) or indirectly through repeated ingestion by the parental birds of feed contaminated with 100 ppm of pyrethroid. Reduction in germ potential was primarily due to the excipient used in the formulation of the commercial product. The xylene, main constituent of the matrix, was responsible for this reductive effect. These chemicals (excipient and xylene) were also chiefly responsible for the high embryo mortality rate observed after injection.

Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of the lipophilic moiety on droplet spread; surfactant phytotoxicity, and surfactant enhancement of herbicide phytotoxicity. Six different lipophilic moieties and two herbicides were evaluated on four plant species. Each lipophilic moiety was represented by two surfactants: one with a low hydrophilic:lipophilic balance (HLB) value, near 12.0, and one with a high HLB value, near 16.0. Droplet spread was greater with low than high HLB surfactants and was greatest with trimethylnonanol ethoxylate (TMN); intermediate with secondary alcohol ethoxylate (SAE) and octylphenol ethoxylate (OPE), and least with linear alcohol ethoxylate (LAE), nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE), and oxysorbic (TWN). Surfactant enhancement of droplet spread was less on redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) than on barley (Hordeum vulgare), green foxtail (Setaria viridis), or kochia (Kochia scoparia). Isopropylamine salt of glyphosate [N- (phosphonomethyl)glycine] and the ammonium salt of imazethapyr {2- [4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl-5-oxo-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-5-ethyl-3- pyridinecarboxylic acid} had little effect on droplet spread. Lipophilic chemistry and HLB affected surfactant phytotoxicity to green foxtail, kochia, and redroot pigweed but not to barley. Foliar injury ranged from 1 to 23% with green foxtail, 0 to 17% with kochia, and 0 to 14% with redroot pigweed. Injury to barley was similar for all surfactants and ranged from 3 to 8%. Injury generally was greater with low than high HLB surfactants. However, SAE and OPE caused greater injury to green foxtail at high than low HLB. Green foxtail was the only plant species injured more than 8% by high HLB surfactants. Droplet spread did not correlate with surfactant phytotoxicity regardless of plant species. Glyphosate phytotoxicity generally was enhanced most by high HLB LAE to barley, green foxtail, and kochia and by high HLB TWN to redroot pigweed. Imazethapyr phytotoxicity was generally greatest when applied with high HLB SAE to barley and redroot pigweed, with high HLB LAE to green foxtail and with low HLB LAE to kochia.

Because of routine practice in various forms of conservation tillage, paraquat (1,1′-dimethyl-4,4′-bipyridinium dichloride) has increasingly been used for weed control in agricultural fields and in supporting management practices. Though highly adsorbed by soil and foliage, paraquat may gain increased notice as an agrichemical potentially impacting wetlands which surround much of the farmland across the country; consequently, amphibian toxicity evaluations may be incorporated into wildlife hazard assessments conducted for chemicals finding increased use in conservation tillage. Using amphibians representative of two anuran families, early life stage toxicity tests (96-h modified FETAX) were performed. Acute and subacute exposures were completed, and toxicity endpoints (mortality and teratogenicity) were evaluated for exposures to technical-grade and formulation-grade paraquat. These preliminary toxicity assessments suggested that acute and subacute endpoints for each form of paraquat may be significantly different, since the commercial formulation was three times as acutely toxic as the technical-grade chemical.

Invertebrate 48-h EC50’s (concentration immobilizing 50% of the test organisms) or LC50’s (concentration lethal to 50% of the test organisms) ranged from 2.4 μg/liter for amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) to 3, 200 μg/liter for larval midges (Chironomus plumosus). Among fish tested, chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) were the most sensitive (96-h LC50, 150 μg/liter) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) the most resistant (96-h LC50, 11, 000 μg/liter). Toxicities of the active ingredient to fishes were similar for the technical grade Imidan and the 50% wettable powder formulation. Toxicities to fish increased with the increasing temperature and decreasing pH, but were unaffected by water hardness. Eyed eggs and yolk-sac fry of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were more resistant to Imidan than were fingerlings. Aging of Imidan in water of 20 C and pH 7.2 decreased its toxicity. Four-day-old solutions were less than 0.04 as toxic as fresh solutions.

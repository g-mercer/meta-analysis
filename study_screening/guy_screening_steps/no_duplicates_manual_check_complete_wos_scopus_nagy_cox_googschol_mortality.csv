Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.",2019,209,1,12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.015,YES,YES,NO,MORPHOLOGY/BEHAVIOUR/DEVELOPMENT,n/a

For this purpose, Planorbarius corneus and Biomphalaria glabrata were exposed to chlorpyrifos (active ingredient or commercial formulation) for 48 h at environmentally realistic concentrations (1 and 7.5 mu g L-1). Basal acetylcholinesterase activity in soft tissues and hemolymph was almost one order of magnitude higher in P. corneus than in B. glabrata. However, upon chlorpyrifos exposure, statistically significant inhibition of enzymatic activity was registered in both species. Acetylcholinesterase was more sensitive to inhibition in soft tissues than in hemolymph. The highest inhibition was observed in the B. glabrata soft tissues exposed to the commercial formulation (88 % at 1 mu g L-1 and 93 % at 7.5 mu g L-1). Hemocyte number and lysosomal membrane stability did not show significant changes with respect to controls in any of the exposed groups. Superoxide anion generation was diminished (21-46 %) in P. corneus hemocytes exposed to the active ingredient and in B. glabrata hemocytes exposed to the active ingredient or the formulation. In contrast, hemocyte phagocytic activity increased in all exposed groups. Phagocytosis was most stimulated (89 %) in hemocytes sampled from B. glabrata treated with 7.5 mu g L-1 chlorpyrifos. Altogether the results suggest that the freshwater gastropods P. corneus and B. glabrata are suitable model animals for environmental monitoring studies in the Northern Hemisphere and Latin America, respectively. Furthermore, these results add information on the relevance of testing pesticide formulations and on the usefulness of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and immunological parameters as biomarkers of the acute effects of chlorpyrifos in these species.",2020,225,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2020.105544,NO,NO,NO,ENZYME ACTIVITY,n/a

A comparative study of these three compounds was carried out to assess how the addition of surfactant components may pose the highest toxicological risk to pesticide formulations. The results showed that arsenal, imazapyr, and NP did not cause chromosome aberration in Allium cepa nor increase the frequency of micronuclei in mice. However, toxicological evaluations showed that NP was the most toxic compound to mice, A. cepa, Drosophila melanogaster, and Biomphalaria tenagophila. In this evaluation, it was observed that the adverse effects were produced by the surfactant additive of the pesticide formulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this context, broad range bioassays have emerged providing economically viable and widely applicable alternatives due to their ability to detect the cumulative toxicity of mixtures of both known and unknown chemicals in a sample, thus allowing direct information about water quality. Here we present a low-cost, wide-range algae-based biosensor that is easy to assemble and operate by untrained users and provides direct readings. It was developed as a request of a peasant social movement organization to assess the toxicity of drinking water in rural communities affected by pesticide spraying. Two fresh water algae strains, Scenedesmus acutus and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, were immobilized in alginate beads and tested as bioindicators. After incubation with different pollutants for five days, naked eye analysis by several observers proved to be a successful method to survey algae's growth and establish the detection limits. Best detection limits were 10 ppm for technical-grade acid glyphosate, 15 ppm for glyphosate-based formulation, 50 ppb for atrazine formulation, 7.5 ppm for copper and 250 ppb for chromium. Absorbance measurements upon algae resuspension validated these results. The developed device was successfully tested in participatory workshops conducted at rural communities. Children, adults and elders with no scientific training were able to build the sensor and interpret the results, thus evaluating the quality of rain and well water used in their communities.

Pregnant women may be frequently exposed to R compounds. These are composed of G, which is declared as the active principle, and other products contained in formulations, named formulants, which have been declared as inerts and diluents by the manufacturers. These formulants have, in fact, been demonstrated to be much more toxic than G, in particular to placental and embryonic human cells. In this work, we thus compared the effect of G and a GT+ formulation named R, using placental perfusion ex vivo. R, but not G alone, was demonstrated to alter the placental permeability of a known small model molecule, antipyrine. Similar results were observed for the fetal venous flow rate. The transfer of G alone increases with time, but is significantly decreased in presence of its formulants. The perfusion of R provokes a destruction of fetal vessels, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Formulants obviously alter the fetal-placental circulation and placental integrity according to time of exposure. Therefore, G does not appear to be the main toxic agent of R. Formulants, although undeclared, include polyoxyethanolamines, PAHs, or heavy metals, and may be responsible for this toxicity. These compounds are also present in other pesticides. The progressive blood flow reduction due to the toxic compounds of formulations may diminish the nutrient supply to the fetus, alter the development, and may enhance the poisoning effects. Although these are preliminary results, they could at least partially explain some adverse pregnancy outcomes in mothers exposed to pesticides or other environmental pollutants.

Glyphosate, its active ingredient in plants and its main metabolite (AMPA) are among the first contaminants of surface waters. Roundup is being used increasingly in particular on genetically modified plants grown for food and feed that contain its residues. Here we tested glyphosate and its formulation on mature rat fresh testicular cells from 1 to 10000 ppm, thus from the range in some human urine and in environment to agricultural levels. We show that from 1 to 48 h of Roundup exposure Leydig cells are damaged. Within 24-48 h this formulation is also toxic on the other cells, mainly by necrosis, by contrast to glyphosate alone which is essentially toxic on Sertoli cells. Later, it also induces apoptosis at higher doses in germ cells and in Sertoli/germ cells co-cultures. At lower non toxic concentrations of Roundup and glyphosate (1 ppm), the main endocrine disruption is a testosterone decrease by 35%. The pesticide has thus an endocrine impact at very low environmental doses, but only a high contamination appears to provoke an acute rat testicular toxicity. This does not anticipate the chronic toxicity which is insufficiently tested, and only with glyphosate in regulatory tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most commonly used herbicides is glyphosate. This compound or its metabolites are frequently detected in surface water in Europe. In the present study, in vivo and in vitro studies were carried out using the early life stages of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the cell line RTL-W1 (a liver cell line from rainbow trout) to characterize the toxic effects of glyphosate at environmentally-realistic concentrations. Both studies were performed using the commercial formulation Roundup (R) GT Max, and technical-grade glyphosate for the in vitro study. Eyed-stage embryos were exposed for 3 weeks to sub-lethal concentrations (0.1 and 1 mg/L) of glyphosate using Roundup. Numerous toxicity endpoints were recorded such as survival, hatching success, larval biometry, developmental abnormalities, swimming activity, genotoxicity (formamidopyrimidine DNA-glycosylase Fpg-modified comet assay), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), protein carbonyls and target gene transcription. Concentrations neither affected embryonic or larval survival nor increased developmental abnormalities. However, a significant decrease was observed in the head size of larvae exposed to 1 mg/L of glyphosate. In addition, a significant increase in mobility was observed for larvae exposed to glyphosate at 0.1 mg/L. TSARS levels were significantly decreased on larvae exposed to 1 mg/L (a.i.), and cat and cox1 genes were differently transcribed from controls. DNA damage was detected by the Fpg-modified comet assay in RTL-W1 cell line exposed to the technical-grade glyphosate and Roundup formulation.

Its market is growing steadily concurrently with the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant transgenic crops and emergence of weeds less sensitive to glyphosate. Ephemeral and lentic waters near to agricultural lands, representing favorite habitats for amphibian reproduction and early life-stage development, may thus be contaminated by glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs) residues. Previous studies on larval anuran species highlighted increased mortality and growth effects after exposure to different GBHs in comparison to glyphosate itself, mainly because of the surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine present in the formulations. Nevertheless, these conclusions are not completely fulfilled when the early development, characterized by primary organogenesis events, is considered. In this study, we compare the embryotoxicity of Roundup((R)) Power 2.0, a new GBH formulation currently authorized in Italy, with that of technical grade glyphosate using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay Xenopus (FETAX). Our results evidenced that glyphosate was not embryolethal and only at the highest concentration (50 mg a.e./L) caused edemas. Conversely, Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 exhibited a 96 h LC50 of 24.78 mg a.e./L and a 96 h EC50 of 7.8 mg a.e./L. A Teratogenic Index of 3.4 was derived, pointing out the high teratogenic potential of the Roundup((R)) Power 2.0. Specific concentration-dependent abnormal phenotypes, such as craniofacial alterations, microphthalmia, narrow eyes and forebrain regionalization defects were evidenced by gross malformation screening and histopathological analysis. These phenotypes are coherent with those evidenced in Xenopus laevis embryos injected with glyphosate, allowing us to hypothesize that the teratogenicity observed for Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 may be related to the improved efficacy in delivering glyphosate to cells, guaranteed by the specific surfactant formulation. In conclusion, the differences in GBH formulations should be carefully considered by the authorities, since sub-lethal and/or long-term effects (e.g. teratogenicity) can be significantly modulated by the active ingredient salt type and concentration of the adjuvants. Finally, the mechanistic toxicity of glyphosate and GBHs are worthy of further research.",2018,195,103,113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.12.007,YES,YES,NO,DEVELOPMENT,n/a

Treatment focuses on the fact that OP compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE): however, AChE-reactivating drugs do not benefit poisoned humans. We therefore studied the role of solvent coformulants in OP toxicity in a novel minipig model of agricultural OP poisoning. Gottingen minipigs were orally poisoned with clinically relevant doses of agricultural emulsifiable concentrate (EC) dimethoate, dimethoate active ingredient (AI) alone, or solvents. Cardiorespiratory physiology and neuromuscular (NMJ) function, blood AChE activity, and arterial lactate concentration were monitored for 12 h to assess poisoning severity. Poisoning with agricultural dimethoate EC40, but not saline, caused respiratory arrest within 30 min, severe distributive shock and NMJ dysfunction, that was similar to human poisoning. Mean arterial lactate rose to 15.6 [SD 2.8] mm in poisoned pigs compared to 1,4[0.4] in controls. Moderate toxicity resulted from poisoning with dimethoate AI alone, or the major solvent cyclohexanone. Combining dimethoate with cyclohexanone reproduced severe poisoning characteristic of agricultural dimethoate EC poisoning. A formulation without cyclohexanone showed less mammalian toxicity. These results indicate that solvents play a crucial role in dimethoate toxicity. Regulatory assessment of pesticide toxicity should include solvents as well as the AIs which currently dominate the assessment. Reformulation of OP insecticides to ensure that the agricultural product has lower mammalian toxicity could result in fewer deaths after suicidal ingestion and rapidly reduce global suicide rates.

Laboratory experiments included three complementary methods. The first involved topical application of the active ingredient (amitraz). The second method investigated the effects of the commercial formulation MITAC(R), emulsifiable concentrate (EC) at 190 g/l amitraz, on ladybeetles dipped in the insecticide mixture. The third method tested the effects of the same commercial product when ladybeetles were fed with scale insects insecticide treated under field conditions. Amitraz or its MITAC(R) formulation applied in concentrations of up to 0.1 % equivalent active ingredient did not affect mortality or fecundity of E. quadripustulatus. However, when treatment was particularly severe as when adults were dipped in a MITAC(R) solution, a reversible tetanization was observed. Assuming that toxicity will also be low under field conditions, a preliminary field experiment was designed to investigate how E. quadripustulatus reacts to a partial MITAC(R) treatment of the vegetation.

Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients.

One example is Betanal (R) Expert, a postemergence herbicide composed of an Advanced Micro Droplet coformulation of phenmedipham, desmedipham, and ethofumesate. Although its composed formulation brings an increase in the pesticide performance, it can also enhance its toxicity to nontarget species. Therefore, the present study intends to contribute with relevant information on ecotoxicological effects of Betanal (R) Expert and its active ingredients on a battery of bioassays using aquatic species from different trophic levels: bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), microalgae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Chlorella vulgaris, and Chlamydomonas pseudocostata), macrophyte (Lemna minor), and cladocerans (Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina) species. Across the organisms tested and endpoints measured, different responses concerning the toxicity of the active ingredients were found: (i) phenmedipham was the most toxic to V. fischeri and L. minor; (ii) desmedipham was the most toxic to P. subcapitata, D. magna, and D. longispina; (iii) and ethofumesate was the most toxic to C. pseudocostata and C. vulgaris. Furthermore, for C. pseudocostata and daphnids, the toxicity observed for some active ingredients was higher than the toxicity of the commercial formulation. In fact, in an attempt to evaluate the contribution of each active ingredient to the overall toxicity of Betanal (R) Expert, it was observed that, in general, the toxicity values obtained for desmedipham and phenmedipham were close or even lower to the values determined for Betanal (R) Expert, indicating that the ethofumesate can act as an antagonist in the three-way coformulation.

Despite evidence that glochidia and juvenile life stages are highly sensitive to some chemical contaminants, the effects of pesticides on early life stages of unionid mussels are largely unknown. In the United States, pesticide registration is based on toxicity data of the active ingredient, not formulations as they are sold and applied. Some pesticide formulations, however, are more toxic than their active ingredient (technical -grade pesticide) alone because of the presence of surfactants, adjuvants, or other ingredients in the formulation. The objective of the present study was to compare the toxicity of active ingredients of several current-use pesticides (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) to the toxicity of pesticide formulations to glochidia and juvenile life stages of a freshwater mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea). The atrazine formulation (Aatrex) was more toxic than technical-grade atrazine in chronic tests with juvenile L. siliquoidea. For other pesticides, acute and chronic toxicity of technical-grade pesticides were similar to the toxicity of pesticide formulations. Median effective concentrations for chlorpyrifos were 0.43 mg/L for glochidia at 48 h, 0.25 mg/L for juveniles at 96 h, and 0.06 mg/L for juveniles at 21 d. Atrazine and permethrin as well as their formulations did not cause significant acute toxicity in glochidia or juveniles at exposure concentrations approaching water-solubility limits. Additional research is needed on other pesticides with different modes of action, on the role of different routes of exposure, and with other species of unionid mussels to evaluate similarities of toxic response.",2007,26,2101,2107,http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/06-555R.1,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

In this study, 96 h LC50 of the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus were determined as 90.0 and 42.0 mu g/L based on 2 h actual concentration of chlorpyrifos in water. About 96 h exposure to sublethal concentrations (0, 12.0 and 25.0 mu g/L) of the commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos reduced the level of hepatic glycogen, activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase, and catalase in liver and elevated the level of plasma glucose and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase in O. niloticus. About 28-day exposure to these sub-lethal concentrations caused anemia in fish, while 90 days exposure reduced growth of the fish and carcass concentration of crude protein and crude lipid as compared to control.

Unfortunately, the effects of such substances are still poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of the active neonicotinoid substance thiacloprid (TH) and the commercial product Calypso 480 SC (CA) (active compound 40.4% TH) on Mytilus galloprovincialis after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations. Mussels were tested for seven days to 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 TH and 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg L-1 CA. For this purpose, several parameters, such as cell viability of haemocytes and digestive cells, biochemical haemolymph features, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity of gills and digestive gland, as well as histology of such tissues were analysed. The sublethal concentrations of both substances lead to abatement or completely stopping the byssal fibres creation. Biochemical analysis of haemolymph showed significant changes (P < 0.01) in electrolytes ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, S-phosphor), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity and glucose concentration following exposure to both substances. The TH-exposed mussels showed significant imbalance (P < 0.05) in CAT activity in digestive gland and gills. CA caused significant decrease (P < 0.05) in SOD activity in gills and in CAT activity in both tissues. Results of histological analyses showed severe damage in both digestive gland and gills in a time and concentration-dependent manner. This study provides useful information about the acute toxicity of a neonicotinoid compound and a commercial insecticide on mussels.

There is, however, a recent trend for the cultivation of cycloxydim-tolerant maize hybrids for use in maize production. We studied the acute toxic effects of the complementary herbicide Focus(A (R)) Ultra and its active ingredient cycloxydim on embryos and early-stage larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). The results indicate that the herbicide formulation is significantly more toxic than the active ingredient alone. Therefore, it is suggested that the added substances either solely or in a synergistic action with the active ingredient are responsible for adverse effects. The formulation was found to be moderately toxic to embryos but highly toxic to early larvae. Based on calculated teratogenic indices, both cycloxydim and Focus(A (R)) Ultra seem to be non-teratogenic and also the minimum Focus(A (R)) Ultra concentration to inhibit growth in embryos and larvae was close to the LC50 values. The data suggest that tests with the rainbow trout are not in all cases appropriate to assess the risk in aquatically developing anurans. This is demonstrated by 96-h LC50 values, which are for rainbow trout more than 50- to 20-fold higher than for early X. laevis larvae.

The shallow tidal creeks and ditches that directly drain agricultural fields are home to the young of the ecologically and economically important blue crab, Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896). Massive mortality observed by peeler crab fishers led us to investigate the acute toxicity of several commercial pesticide formulations and their active ingredients to blue crab megalopae and J1-J4 stage juveniles. Twenty-four hour acute toxicity assays were conducted with the organophosphate acephate (Orthene (R)), the carbamate aldicarb, the chloro-nicotinyl imidacloprid (Trimax (TM)), the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin (Karate (R) with Zeon Technology), and the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup (R) Pro. LC50 values ranged from 0.22 mu g/L for megalopae exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin to 316,000 mu g/L for juveniles exposed to Roundup. The acute toxicities of active ingredient insecticides to blue crabs followed the order: lambda-cyhalothrin > imidacloprid approximate to aldicarb > acephate. Megalopae were almost always more sensitive than juveniles and there was little difference between the LC(50)s of each commercial formulation and its active ingredient. Treatment of intermolt megalopae with LC20 levels of Roundup resulted in significantly reduced time to metamorphosis (TTM) compared to estuarine water controls, while no differences resulted from treatment with the four active ingredient insecticides. Treatment with acephate, aldicarb, imidacloprid, and Roundup significantly increased the frequency of juveniles that died within 6 h of molting. The sensitivity of molting blue crabs to these pesticides makes frequently molting juveniles particularly vulnerable to pesticides in estuaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The formulated herbicides tested were Eradicane® (EPTC), Fargo® (triallate), Lasso® (alachlor), ME4 Brominal® (bromoxynil), Ramrod® (propachlor), Rodeo® (glyphosate), Sencor® (metribuzin), and Sutan (+)® (butylate); the two surfactants were Activator N.F.® and Ortho X-77®. In addition, technical grade alachlor, metribuzin, propachlor, and triallate were tested for comparison with the formulated herbicides. The relative toxicity of the commercial formulations, based on percent active ingredient, varied considerably. The EC50 values ranged from 1.23 mg/L for Fargo® to 5,600 mg/L for Rodeo®. Fargo®, ME4 Brominal®, and Ramrod® were moderately toxic to midge larvae; Lasso®, Sutan (+)®, and Eradicane® were slightly toxic; and Sencor® and Rodeo® were practically non-toxic. The 48-hr EC50 values of the two surfactants were nearly identical and were considered moderately toxic to midges. For two of the herbicides in which the technical grade material was tested, the inert ingredients in the formulations had a significant effect on the toxicity of the active ingredients. Fargo® was twice as toxic as technical grade triallate, whereas Sencor® was considerably less toxic than technical grade metribuzin. A comparison of the slope function values indicated that the toxic action of all the compounds occurred within a relatively narrow range. Published acute toxicity data on these compounds for other freshwater biota were tabulated and compared with our results. In general, the relative order of toxicity to C. riparius was similar to those for other freshwater invertebrates and fish. Maximum concentrations of each herbicide in bulk runoff during a projected ""critical"" runoff event were calculated as a percentage of the application rate lost in a given volume of runoff.

This is vital to meet the challenges associated with “cocktail effects”, i.e. combination effects of chemicals present simultaneously in a product, our environment, and/or our body. For plant protection products (PPPs), investigations largely focus on active ingredients such as herbicides and fungicides. In this study, we have analyzed agricultural chemicals, two surfactants (poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), alpha-sulfo-omega-[2,4,6-tris(1-phenylethyl)phenoxy]-, ammonium salt, POL; N,N-dimethylcapramide, NND), and one preservative, 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2 H)-one (BEN) used as adjuvants in PPPs, and further three fungicide PPPs, Proline EC 250, Shirlan, Folicur Xpert, containing the adjuvants, and other major individual constituents (fluazinam (FLU), prothioconazole (PRO), tebuconazole (TEB)) as well as defined mixtures (“mixes”) thereof using several in vitro approaches. All investigated single agricultural chemicals were predicted as skin sensitizers using an in vitro transcriptomic assay based on a dendritic cell model. For selected chemicals and mixes, also skin sensitization potency was predicted. The preservative BEN induced significant changes in cytokine secretion and dendritic cell activation marker CD86 expression. The surfactant NND changed cytokine secretion only and the POL only affected CD86 expression. Proteomic analyses revealed unique response profiles for all adjuvants, an oxidative stress pattern response in BEN-treated cells, and differentially abundant proteins associated with cholesterol homeostasis in response to POL. In summary, we find responses to agricultural chemicals and products consistent with the dendritic cell model reacting to chemical exposure with oxidative stress, ER stress, effects on autophagy, and metabolic changes especially related to cholesterol homeostasis. After exposure to certain mixes, novel proteins or transcripts were differentially expressed and these were not detected for any single constituents, supporting the occurrence of cocktail effects.

So the present study was designed to investigate the adverse effects of exposure to formulated chlorpyrifos-ethyl (9.60 mg kg-1 b.wt.), chlorpyrifos-methyl (300 mg kg-1 b.wt.) and methomyl (1.70 mg kg-1 b.wt.) on some haematological and biochemical parameters of male rats given repetitive oral doses for 90 consecutive days. There was significant decrease in body weight gain of chlorpyrifos-ethyl, chlorpyrifos-methyl and methomyl and increase in relative liver and kidney weights of chlorpyrifos-ethyl and chlorpyrifos-methyl treated rats. Chlorpyrifos-methyl caused significant decrease in Hb cone. Haematocrit value (PCV, %) and Red Blood Cells (RCBs) counts, while chlorpyrifos-ethyl and methomyl caused significant decrease in PCV% and White Blood Cells (WBCs) counts. All of the tested insecticides increased significantly serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) activities and decreased significantly the total protein level. In addition, the tested insecticides caused significant increase in serum uric acid and creatinine. We can conclude that both technical and formulated methomyl and chlorpyrifos-ethyl and its methyl analogues caused significant alteration on hematological and biochemical parameter of mal rats. The effects of commercial form of tested insecticides were more pronounced than its technical form. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.",2012,6,160,168,10.3923/rjet.2012.160.168,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,was not making comparison of interest.

In this study, the combined effects of different ethoxylates and pesticides on the bioactivity against three pests and toxicological risks to Daphnia magna were investigated. Results showed that alcohol ethoxylates (AEOs) had higher synergistic effects on the bioactivity of pesticides against Spodoptera exigua, Agrotis ipsilon and Aphis citricola than did APEOs. In terms of the joint toxicity of the ethoxylates and pesticides to D. magna, additive index method, toxicity unit method, V value method and isobologram method were used in the tests. All of these methods indicated that the joint effects of APEOs + acetamiprid and APEOs + indoxacarb upon D. magna turned from synergism to antagonism with the increasing EO (ethylene oxide) numbers. Those of AEOs exhibited similar trends. Overall, AEOs may be potential alternatives for APEOs in agriculture as they synergize pesticides against three pests significantly more than do APEOs. However, further research should investigate the compounds’ environmental risks to aquatic organisms because the AEOs were highly toxic to D. magna. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,644,1452,1459,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.012,YES,NO,YES,n/a,wasn't looking at ai vs formulation but ai + adjuvant.

We investigated the possible toxic effects of the glyphosate active compound and its commercial formulation (Roundup Star((R))) in the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line, including their effects on the cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and expression of oxidative stress-related genes such as HO-1, Hsp70 Nrf2, L-FABP, and Keap1. MTT and NRU tests indicated that the IC50 values of Roundup Star((R)) were 219 and 140 mu M, respectively, and because glyphosate failed to induce cell death at the studied concentrations, an IC50 value could not be determined for this cell line. Roundup Star at concentrations of 50 and 100 mu M significantly increased (39.58% and 52%, respectively) cell proliferation, which 200 mu M of glyphosate increased by 35.38%.

Altered transcription levels of liver vitellogenin (vtg) have been documented in wild populations of 2 Great Barrier Reef fisheries species and were strongly associated with pesticide-containing runoff from sugarcane plantations. The present study examined endocrine and physiological biomarkers in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of commercial herbicide (ATRADEX® WG Herbicide, DIUREX® WG Herbicide) and surfactant (ACTIVATOR® 90) formulations commonly used on sugarcane in the Great Barrier Reef catchment. Estrogenic biomarkers (namely, liver vtg messenger RNA and plasma 17β-estradiol) increased following exposure to commercial mixtures but not to the analytical grade chemical, suggesting an estrogenic response to the additives. In contrast, brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) transcription levels, plasma testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone concentrations, and gill ventilation rates were not affected by any of the experimental exposures. These findings support the assertion that exposure to pesticide-containing runoff from sugarcane plantations is a potential causative agent of altered liver vtg transcription levels in wild barramundi. Whether exposure patterns in the Great Barrier Reef catchment and lagoon are sufficient to impair fish sexual and reproductive development and ultimately influence fish population dynamics remains to be determined. These findings highlight the need to consider both active and so-called inert ingredients in commercial pesticide formulations for environmental risk assessments. © 2015 SETAC.",2015,34,1881,1890,10.1002/etc.3011,NO,NO,NO,ENDOCRINE/PHYSIOLOGY,n/a

Herein, we present a facile supramolecular formulation of PQ@cucurbit[7]uril (PQ@CB[7]), prepared by simply mixing PQ with equivalent (molar) CB[7] in water. With addition of CB[7], PQ's cellular uptake was dramatically inhibited. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the associated apoptosis otherwise induced by PQ in cellular models were both reduced, resulting in increased cellular viability. In a wildtype zebrafish model that is a typical fragile wildlife species in the ecosystem, the supramolecular formulation exhibited significantly reduced hepatotoxicity and increased survival rate, in comparison with those of the fish exposed to free PQ. In a mouse model that is clinically relevant to human being, the administration of PQ@CB[7] significantly alleviated major organ injuries and unusual hematological parameters that were otherwise induced by free PQ, resulting in a significantly increased survival rate.

Data on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of deltamethrin are rather controversial, depending on the genetic system or the assay used. The aim of the present study was to analyze previously demonstrated metabolic changes using aspecific noninvasive methods in rats which art: potentially applicable for monitoring occupational exposure. Since human exposure to pesticides occurs not only to active principles but to ail chemicals present in a commercial formulation, we tested both the pure compound and a deltamethrin-based commercial formulation. Groups of rats were treated, i.p., consecutively for 7 days. The daily doses tested were 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight for pure deltamethrin, corresponding to volumes of 178.57 and 377.14 mu l/kg body weight for the commercial formulation (containing 2.8% deltamethrin). Urine was analyzed for mutagenic metabolites, thioethers, and D-glucaric acid content. Faeces extracts were tested for mutagenicity. Results show that DGA urinary excretion values did not mirror the phase I enzyme induction capability of the insecticide. Results obtained for urinary thioethers do not agree completely with those obtained on the influence of deltamethrin on glutathione S-transferase activity in rat liver. In fact, after administration of the deltamethrin commercial formulation, highest thioether excretion values were obtained during the treatment time for treated animals, as compared to controls. The mean values (+/-SEM) of thioether excretion were 0.033 +/- 0.002 mu mole -SH/24 h for control animals, 0.122 +/- 0.004 and 0.185 +/- 0.025 for the two treatment groups. Thence, thioether determination in urine samples seems to be a suitable aspecific noninvasive method for assessing exposure to deltamethrin-based formulations, particularly those containing xylene and mesitylene as solvents, as in the tested formulation.

Recently, non-animal approaches including the KeratinoSens (TM) assay have been developed for predicting skin sensitization potential. Assessing the utility of the KeratinoSens (TM) assay for use with multi-component mixtures such as agrochemical formulations has not been previously evaluated and is a significant need. This study was undertaken to evaluate the KeratinoSens (TM) assay prediction potential for agrochemical formulations. The assay was conducted for 8 agrochemical active ingredients (AIs) including 3 sensitizers (acetochlor, meptyldinocap, triclopyr), 5 non-sensitizers (aminopyralid, clopyralid, florasulam, methoxyfenozide, oxyfluorfen) and 10 formulations for which in vivo sensitization data were available. The KeratinoSens (TM) correctly predicted the sensitization potential of all the AIs. For agrochemical formulations it was necessary to modify the standard assay procedure whereby the formulation was assumed to have a common molecular weight. The resultant approach correctly predicted the sensitization potential for 3 of 4 sensitizing formulations and all 6 non-sensitizing formulations when compared to in vivo data.

The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA > Roundup((R)) > glyphosate acid > IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity. Microtox((R)) bacterium and protozoa had similar sensitivities towards Roundup((R)) toxicity (i.e. IC50 from 23.5 to 29.5 mg AE/l).

There were negligible changes in the activity of acid phosphatase, regardless of exposure dose, whereas significant (p < 0.05) variations in activities of invertase, urease, and catalase were observed at a dose of 5 mg kg(-1) or higher. Invertase activity decreased with an increasing bioavailable Cu concentration in soil under various treatments. In comparison to CuSO4, both Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide (i.e., NPF) and nano-Cu(OH)(2) (i.e., AI-NPF and NR) caused a significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of urease activity, wherein a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the activity of catalase was observed, representing serious oxidative stress. Accordingly, NPF, AI-NPF, and NR differently affected soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community compared to CuSO4, which could have resulted from the changes in the bioavailable Cu concentration as a result of the distinct nature of copper spiked (i.e., nano form versus salt). Moreover, minor differences in the soil enzyme activity and bacterial community were observed between NPF and AI-NPF, reflecting that the impact of the Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide was primarily attributed to the presence of nano-Cu(OH)(2). In total, the impacts of nano-Cu(OH)(2) on the soil bacterial community and enzyme activity tested in this study differed from CuSO4, shedding light on the environmental risks of the Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide in the long run.",2020,68,3372,3381,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b06325,NO,NO,NO,ENZYME ACTIVITY,n/a

This study determined the toxicity of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, both pure and in the formulation Actara (R) (25% active substance), to the springtail Folsomia candida, over three generations (P, Fl and F2). For the parental generation (P), the toxicity of pure thiamethoxam and Actara (R) did not differ significantly, with LC50S and EC50S of 0.32-0.35 and 0.23-0.25 mg a.s./kg dry soil, respectively. For the Fl and F2 generations, LC50S were >0.37 mg a.s./kg dry soil for both compounds. Actara was more toxic towards reproduction in the F1 generation (EC50 0.16 mg a.s./kg dry soil) than pure thiamethoxam (EC50 0.23 mg a.s./kg dry soil). For generation F2, there was no significant difference in the toxicity of the compounds towards reproduction, with EC50S of >0.37 and 0.30 mg a.s./kg dry soil for Actara (R) and pure thiamethoxam respectively.

Such studies are crucial for improving our understanding of the impact of these substances on stream ecology. In this study, we assess the effects of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; the main degradation product of glyphosate) on the photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate and chlorophyll a content of Nitella microcarpa var. wrightii, a green algae found worldwide. Three concentrations of technical-grade glyphosate and Roundup were tested (0.28, 3.5 and 6 mg l-1), while for AMPA only one concentration was evaluated (0.03 mg l-1). Our results indicate that glyphosate has a stronger inhibitory effect on photosynthetic rate when applied in association with a surfactant (Roundup). These effects are related both to the concentration of the active ingredient and to exposure time. On the other hand, treatment with AMPA had a stimulatory effect on the photosynthetic rate, which may be associated with an increased supply of phosphorus available to the algae from the AMPA degradation process. From an ecological perspective, our results show that the ecological distribution of N. microcarpa var. wrightii, in terms of both spatial and temporal scales, can be affected by glyphosate-based herbicides in streams. © 2016 International Phycological Society.",2016,55,577,584,10.2216/16-12.1,NO,NO,NO,PHOTOSYNTHESIS,n/a

The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled, mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to their corresponding controls.

Cell viability was determined using the AlmarBlue Toxicity Assay Nontoxic concentrations of these chemicals were concomitantly with nerve growth factor and neurite Outgrowth was assessed. Results: Ortho Home Defense (R) preparation reduced PC12 cell viability by approximately 50% and 70% at dilutions that correlate to bifenthrin concentrations of 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M, respectively. In contrast, technical grade bifenthrin, was not toxic to PC12 cells at 10(-3) M, which was the highest concentration tested that was soluble.

Aquatic ecosystems in the proximity of agricultural areas are particularly vulnerable to pesticides, which cause underperformance or extinction of non-target sensitive species. Once in the aquatic system, these chemicals can affect biological processes at multiple levels (molecular, individual, populational), causing ecosystem imbalance across multiple scales. In this study, the effect of a commercial formulation of a herbicide (Primextra (R) Gold TZ) and its main active ingredient (a.i., S-metolachlor) was studied on a freshwater cladoceran species (Daphnia longispina), at different levels of biological organization and temporal scales. S-metolachlor is used in many herbicide formulations applied in corn/maize cultures, which is a relevant culture worldwide. As a first step, the acute and chronic effects of both commercial formulation and a.i. were quantified, and both formulations negatively affected the cladoceran's survival and reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction, number of offspring and number of broods), as well as the population's rate of increase. Whilst acute effects were comparable, the commercial formulation was slightly more toxic (EC50 was two-times lower) than the a.i. in chronic exposures, being prejudicial to D. longispina populations above 4.0 mg/L of S-metolachlor. In a second experimental step, we focused on the potential multi-generational impacts of the exposure to the a.i. alone on biochemical (lipid biomarkers, namely fatty acids) and populational responses, because of the relevance of S-metolachlor as a biosynthesis inhibitor in many herbicidal formulations. The herbicide caused a significant decrease in Daphnia fecundity (in the size of the 1st clutch), but no concomitant alterations were found in fatty acid profiles of mothers or offspring. More important, this experiment showed that S-metolachlor did not cause effects in the subsequent generation, thus suggesting that biotic communities may recover after exposure to the xenobiotic.

With a motivation based on these clinical observations, we tried to elucidate the exact component and its mode of action that is mostly responsible for the direct cardiovascular effects of this herbicide formulation, investigating the effects of BASTA, GLA, and AES independently on the cardiovascular system in rats in vitro and in vivo. In isolated right atria beating spontaneously in Krebs-Ringer's solution, BASTA and AES produced negative chronotropic responses in a concentration-dependent manner. In electrically driven isolated left atria, BASTA and AES produced positive inotropic responses concentration dependently but negative inotropic responses at extremely high concentrations. In aortic ring segments, BASTA and AES produced no vasoconstrictive effects but exerted significant vasodilative effects when the aortic ring was precontracted with phenylephrine. These in vitro responses caused by BASTA and AES occurred to a similar degree. On the other hand, the main component, GLA, produced no effects in isolated atria and aortas. In anesthetized rats, relatively low doses of BASTA and AES produced a decrease in blood pressure followed by a slight increase in heart rate, which was presumably due to baroreflex caused by the decrease in blood pressure. At an extremely high dose, BASTA and AES produced a decrease in blood pressure with a marked decrease in heart rate. These in vivo responses to BASTA and AES also occurred to a similar degree. In contrast, the main component, GLA, did not produce any effects on heart rate and blood pressure in anesthetized rats. From these results, we concluded that the effects of BASTA in our in vivo experiments were not caused by the main component, GLA, but was mostly caused by AES through its vasodilative effects plus cardiostimulatory effects at low doses and cardiosuppressive effects at high doses.

To clarify the potential risk of herbicides and their adjuvants influence on the cardiovascular system, four technical grade (TG) herbicides and their end products (EP), including paraquat, glyphosate, glufosinate, and atrazine, as well as their formulated adjuvants isopropylamine (IPA), polyoxyethylene alkylether sulfate (AES), ethyl acetate (EA), xylene, petrolium-170 (P-170), and solvesso-100 (S-100), were assessed to determine their effects on isolated rat aorta and heart. The results revealed that the vasorelaxation effects of the herbicide EPs exceeded those of TGs, and atrazine produced more significant vasorelaxation in rat aortas than the other herbicides tested. The formulated adjuvants of IPA did not affect the aorta; however, AES, EA, xylene, P-170 and S-100 caused significant vasorelaxation. Herbicide EPs-induced vasorelaxation was generally endothelium-dependent. Furthermore, the TG and EP of paraquat, and the TG of glufosinate and glyphosate were found to have no effect on the isolated heart. However, the normal twitch tensions of the isolated heart were significantly inhibited by EPs of glyphosate and glufosinate, and by TG and EP of atrazine. Although, the adjuvants of IPA appeared unaffected, however, AES, EA, xylene, P-170 and S-100 caused complete inhibition and contraction on the isolated hearts. These results indicated that the adjuvants of herbicides might enhance hypotension and contributed to cardiovascular disorders during intoxication. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to direct damage to the photosynthetic machinery, it was shown that cells experienced membrane fragmentation. Within 30 min, over 90% of the exposed cells were nonviable. However, sethoxydim, the active ingredient, did not cause detrimental effects when applied along with mineral spirits, the primary solvent of the formulation.

However, the aqueous solubility and soil sorption of this compound can cause problems of toxicity in nontarget organisms. This work investigates the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles composed of chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) to produce an efficient herbicidal formulation that was less toxic and could be used for safer control of weeds in agriculture. The toxicities of the formulations were evaluated using cell culture viability assays and the Allium cepa chromosome aberration test. The herbicidal activity was investigated in cultivations of maize (Zea mays) and mustard (Brassica sp.), and soil sorption of the nanoencapsulated herbicide was measured. The efficiency association of paraquat with the nanoparticles was 62.6 +/- 0.7%. Encapsulation of the herbicide resulted in changes in its diffusion and release as well as its sorption by soil. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays showed that the nanoencapsulated herbicide was less toxic than the pure compound, indicating its potential to control weeds while at the same time reducing environmental impacts. Measurements of herbicidal activity showed that the effectiveness of paraquat was preserved after encapsulation. It was concluded that the encapsulation of paraquat in nanoparticles can provide a useful means of reducing adverse impacts on human health and the environment, and that the formulation therefore has potential for use in agriculture.

We investigated separately the effects of iminoctadine, POEAE, and BFR on heart rate and blood pressure of rats and also on isolated atria and aortas. In isolated rat atria, iminoctadine produced positive chronotropic and inotropic responses. In contrast, POEAE produced negative chronotropic and inotropic responses. BFR produced no effects at low concentrations, but significant negative chronotropic and inotropic responses at high concentrations. In isolated rat aortas, iminoctadine produced remarkable vasodilative responses, but POEAE produced vasoconstrictive responses. BFR produced both vasodilative and vasoconstrictive responses. When intravenously administered to anesthetized rats, iminoctadine produced hypotension and tachycardia in a dose-dependent manner. POEAE produced significant hypotension and slight bradycardia. BFR, at low doses, produced hypotension without elevation of heart rate. At high doses, it produced significant hypotension and tachycardia.

Glyphosate herbicides such as brands of Roundup, are known to be toxic to daphnids. However, published findings on acute toxicity show significant discrepancies and variation across several orders of magnitude. To test the acute effects of both glyphosate and a commercial formulation of Roundup (hereafter Roundup), we conducted a series of exposure experiments with different clones and age-classes of D. magna. The results demonstrated EC50 (48) values in the low ppm-range for Roundup as well as for the active ingredient (a.i.) isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (glyphosate IPA) alone. Roundup showed slightly lower acute toxicity than glyphosate IPA alone, i.e. EC50 values of 3.7-10.6 mg a.i./l, as compared to 1.4-7.2 mg a.i./l for glyphosate IPA. However, in chronic toxicity tests spanning the whole life-cycle, Roundup was more toxic. D. magna was exposed to sublethal nominal concentrations of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l for 55 days. Significant reduction of juvenile size was observed even in the lowest test concentrations of 0.05 mg a.i./l, for both glyphosate and Roundup.

In contrast, the additional components in pesticide formulations have been overlooked as potential threats. By testing an acute oral dose of the fungicide product Amistar, and equivalent doses of each individual co-formulant, we were able to measure the toxicity of the formulation and identify the ingredient responsible. We found that a co-formulant, alcohol ethoxylates, caused a range of damage to bumble bee health. Exposure to alcohol ethoxylates caused 30% mortality and a range of sublethal effects. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees consumed half as much sucrose as negative control bees over the course of the experiment and lost weight. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees had significant melanisation of their midguts, evidence of gut damage.

Since aquatic and terrestrial stages of amphibians can be exposed to these substances, adverse effects cannot be excluded. We investigated acute aquatic and terrestrial effects of the herbicide formulation Focus (R) Ultra, its active substance cycloxydim, its co-formulants solvent naphtha and docusate as well as the stabilizing adjuvant Dash (R) E.C. on larval and juvenile Rana temporaria. Aquatic toxicity was determined as 96-h LC50 values. Cycloxydim was the least toxic and solvent naphtha the most toxic substance of the formulation. The addition of Dash (R) E.C. increased the formulation toxicity substantially. Terrestrial toxicity was determined as lethal effects after a 48-h exposure to contaminated soil with 100% of the recommended field rate (FR) and as sublethal effects after the exposure to 10% of the recommended FR. The exposure to solvent naphtha and docusate at 100% FR led tomortalities of 42-100% probably due to their inhalation toxicity and dermal as well as eye irritation, respectively. Cycloxydim, Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. did not lead to any mortality. Sublethal effects on juvenile locomotor activity (i.e. moved distance) were observed for cycloxydim and the combined exposure of Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. Juvenile body masses declined significantly for all substances except for cycloxydim. The present results show that aquatic sensitivity does not predict terrestrial sensitivity. It was shown that pesticide toxicity for amphibians can highly depend on the presence and amount of co-formulants and added adjuvants. Therefore, substances included in pesticide formulations which are known to be toxic by inhalation or harmful to eyes or skin should be specifically considered in the environmental risk assessment for amphibians.

Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate insecticide extensively used in agricultural practices. The anionic surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) is the main component of several commercial products, including foaming agents used in underground mechanised excavation. Both compounds are produced and sold in high amounts worldwide and can be found in the environment as soil contaminants. The persistence of SLES and CPF in agricultural soils and their possible effects on the natural microbial community was evaluated in microcosms. The experimental set consisted of soil samples containing the autochthonous microbial community and treated with only SLES (70 mg/kg), only CPF (2 mg/kg) or with a mix of both compounds. Control microcosms (without the contaminants) were also performed. Soil samples were collected over the experimental period (0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days) and analysed for CPF, SLES and the main metabolite of CPF (3, 5, 6-trichloropyridinol, TCP). The half-life time (DT50) of each parent compound was estimated in all experimental conditions. At the same time, the abundance, activity and structure of the microbial community were also evaluated. The results showed that the co-presence of SLES and CPF did not substantially affect their persistence in soil (DT50 of 11 and 9 days with co-presence and 13 and 10 days, respectively, when alone); however, in the presence of SLES, a higher amount of the metabolite TCP was found.

Results: ATZ and GLY impaired sperm quality but GLY has more adverse effect on sperm quality than ATZ. Testosterone level, sperm motility, sperm counts, live/dead ratio and the weight of the epididymis were lower in the GLY group compared to the ATZ group by 57%, 33%, 20%, 22% and 41% and higher by 109%, 76.7%, 39.6%, 32.3% and 100% respectively in the combine-exposure group (ATZ + GLY) compared to the GLY group.

Constant usage of pesticides presents a burden for soil and causes a decrease in its health, including the negative effects on earthworms which are indicators for soil quality. The objective of this research was the assessment of the effects of two insecticides and two herbicides on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Namely, the following active ingredients and respective commercial preparations were investigated: esfenvalerate (Sumialfa), thiacloprid (Calypso), dimethenamid-p (Frontier) and prosulfocarb (Filon). Lethal concentrations (48 h) of both active ingredient and commercial preparations were determined using the filter paper contact test. Results The results showed that Calypso and Frontier were significantly more toxic than the active ingredient. Therefore, all further measurements were performed after exposure of earthworms to the commercial preparations of the pesticides. Specifically, several enzymatic biomarkers and multixenobiotic resistance activity were assessed. Additionally, a fluorescence-based assay for the determination of oxidative stress was established. Significant changes were detected for catalase, carboxylesterase and multixenobiotic activities after 48-h exposures. Also, a significant change in oxidative stress parameters could be observed for both Calypso and Frontier. Conclusions The obtained results show that commercial preparations can be more toxic than the active ingredients, and the formulations being distributed in the environment can affect earthworms on a molecular level already after short exposures.

Significant (P < 0.05) alterations in the levels of the kidney biomarker, oxidative stress markers, and membrane-bound enzymes were observed in the rats exposed to Roundup compared to the rats exposed to glyphosate alone. Rats exposed to Roundup accumulated more glyphosate residue in their kidney tissue. Severe histopathological lesions were only seen in the kidneys of rats exposed to Roundup. The nephrotoxicity observed cannot be due to the active ingredient in the Roundup formulation, as glyphosate alone has virtually no effect on the renal function of the exposed animals. Therefore, the general claim attributing nephrotoxicity of a glyphosate-based herbicide to its active ingredient should be discouraged.",2018,37,285,295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1091581818779553,NO,NO,NO,NEPHROTOXICITY,n/a

It is solely used in more than 750 different glyphosate-based herbicide formulations (GBHs) that also contain other substances, mostly presumed as inert by regulatory agencies. The toxicity of formulations is currently assessed substance by substance, neglecting possible combined effects in mixtures and many of the findings regarding the toxic effects of glyphosate and GBHs to human cells are inconsistent. This is the first study to investigate and compare the cyto- and genotoxic potential of the active ingredient glyphosate and GBHs in human mononuclear white blood (HMWB) cells. HMWB cells were treated for 4 h at 37 degrees C with increasing concentrations (1-1000 mu M) of glyphosate alone and in three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) to test cytotoxic effect with fluorescent colabelling and genotoxic effect with comet assay. In addition, each concentration was tested with and without metabolic activation using human liver S9 fraction. We found that glyphosate alone does not induce significant cytotoxicity and genotoxicity over the tested concentration range. Contrarily, GBHs induced statistically significant cell death from 250 mu M (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 500 mu M (Fozat 480), as well as statistically significant increase of DNA damage from 500 mu M (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 750 mu M (Fozat 480); however, the latter observation may not be explained by direct DNA injuries, rather due to the high level of cell death (> 70%) exerted by the formulations. Metabolic activation significantly increased the DNA damage levels induced by Glyfos, but not of the other GBHs and of glyphosate. The differences observed in the toxic pattern of formulations and the active principle may be attributed to the higher cytotoxic activity of other ingredients in the formulations or to the interaction of them with the active ingredient glyphosate.

Therefore, we compared effects of MET technical (METt) and commercial (METc) grades on sperm quality and DNA integrity. Male mice were injected (intraperitoneal, i.p.) with METt or METc (3.75, 5, and 7 mg/kg bw/day/4 days) and sacrificed 24 h post-treatment. Sperm cells collected from epididymis-vas deferens were evaluated for quality parameters, DNA damage by the comet assay, and lipoperoxidation by malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was evaluated by acetylthiocho-line inhibition as an index of overall toxicity. A dose-dependent AChE inhibition was observed with both formulations. Sperm quality was decreased after treatment with both MET compounds, but the commercial formulation showed stronger effects; a similar profile was observed with the DNA damage, being METc more genotoxic.

One outstanding threat is the unintended exposure of these pollinators to agricultural pesticides. Anthranilic diamides, such as chlorantraniliprole, are registered for use in stone and pome fruits, vegetables, turf, and grains. There are few publicly available studies that provide an analysis of chlorantraniliprole effects on the survivorship and locomotion activity of beneficial, pollinating insects such as honey bees. The data gathered in this study provide the acute toxicity, 30-day survivorship, and locomotor activity of honey bees exposed to technical-grade chlorantraniliprole and three formulated products with chlorantraniliprole as the active ingredient. RESULTS Neither the technical-grade nor the formulated products of chlorantraniliprole were acutely toxic to honey bees following 4 or 72h treatments at the tested concentrations. A 4 h treatment of technical-grade and formulated chlorantraniliprole did not significantly affect the 30-day survivorship, although significantly higher mortality was observed after 30 days for bees receiving a 72 h treatment of technical-grade chlorantraniliprole and two formulated products. The locomotion activity, or total walking distance, of bees receiving a 4 h treatment of one chlorantraniliprole formulation was significantly reduced, with these individuals recovering their normal locomotion activity at 48 h post exposure. Conversely, there was observed lethargic behavior and significantly reduced walking distances for bees provided with a 72 h treatment of technical-grade chlorantraniliprole and each formulated product. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence for the effect of long-term exposure of chlorantraniliprole on the survivorship and locomotor activity of honey bees. Bees receiving a more field-relevant short-term exposure survived and moved similarly to untreated bees, reiterating the relative safety of chlorantraniliprole exposure to adult honey bees at recommended label concentrations.",2020,76,2582,2588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5832,YES,NO,NO,LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY,not equivalent concentrations of ai/formulation

Roundup stimulates succinate-supported respiration twice, with simultaneous collapse of transmembrane electrical potential, while glyphosate used in the same concentrations does not induce any significant effect. Additionally, Roundup depresses state 3 respiration by about 40%, at 15 mM, whereas uncoupled respiration in the presence of FCCP is depressed by about 50%. Depression of uncoupled respiratory activity is mediated through partial inhibition of mitochondrial complexes II and III, but not of complex IV. The phosphorylative system was affected by both a direct and an indirect effect on the F0F1 ATPase activity. The addition of uncoupled concentrations of Roundup to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria treated with Ruthenium Red resulted in non-specific membrane permeabilization, as evidenced by mitochondrial swelling in isosmotic sucrose medium. Therefore, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is also related to the non-specific membrane permeabilization induced by Roundup. Glyphosate alone does not show any relevant effect on the mitochondrial bioenergetics, in opposition to Roundup formulation products. The differences in the toxicity observed could be either attributed to some products of Roundup or to a synergic effect of glyphosate and formulation products. Bearing in mind that mitochondria is provided with a variety of bioenergetic functions mandatory for the regulation of intracellular aerobic energy production and electrolyte homeostasis, these results question the safety of Roundup on animal health.

While glycine is an essential amino acid generally recognized safe, both epidemiological and toxicological in vivo and in vitro studies available in literature report conflicting findings on the toxicity of GBHs. In our earlier in vivo studies in Sprague-Dawley rats we observed that exposure to GBHs at doses of glyphosate of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, induced different toxic effects relating to sexual development, endocrine system, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiome. In the present work, we aimed to comparatively test in in vitro models the cytotoxicity of glycine and GBHs. Methods: We tested the cytotoxic effects of glycine, glyphosate, and its formulation Roundup Bioflow at different doses using MTT and Trypan Blue assays in human Caco2 and murine L929 cell lines. Results: Statistically significant dose-related cytotoxic effects were observed in MTT and Trypan Blue assays in murine (L929) and human (Caco2) cells treated with glyphosate or Roundup Bioflow. No cytotoxic effects were observed for glycine. In L929, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in both MTT and Trypan Blue assays. In Caco2, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in the MTT assays, while a comparable IC50 was observed for glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow in Trypan Blue assays. IC50 for glycine could not be estimated because of the lack of cytotoxic effects of the substance. Conclusion: Glyphosate and its formulation Roundup Bioflow, but not glycine, caused dose-related cytotoxic effects in in vitro human and murine models (Caco2 and L929). Our results showed that glycine and its analog glyphosate presented different cytotoxicity profiles.

These herbicides are frequently paired with a safener, which prevents herbicidal damage to the crop without diminishing weed control. Formulated herbicide products that include safeners and other ingredients are infrequently assessed for toxicity.

We quantified the concentration of safeners in commercially available formulations and tested effects on nontarget algae, Raphidocelis subcapitata, when exposed to individual herbicide active ingredients, safeners, and commercial formulations. The median effective concentrations (EC50s) causing 50% reduction in population growth for the herbicide active ingredients S-metolachlor and acetochlor were 0.046 and 0.003 ppm, respectively.

Human erythrocytes were incubated with 100-1500 ppm (100 mug/ml erythrocytes at 5% hematocrite) Roundup Ultra 360 SL and glyphosate. We have found that after 1 h of incubation only Roundup Ultra 360 SL increased the level of methemoglobin, products of lipid peroxidation at 500 ppm and hemolysis at 1500 ppm [Curr. Top.

Both Roundup Ultra 360 SL and glyphosate did not cause statistically significant changes in the level of GSH, but increased the activity of catalase. Roundup Ultra 360 SL provokes more changes in the function of erythrocytes than its active substance glyphosate, which is probably a result of the properties of additives. Taking into account the limited accumulation of Roundup Ultra 360 SL and glyphosate in the organism as well as the fact that the threshold doses which caused changes in erythrocytes for Roundup Ultra 360 SL were only 500 and 1000 ppm for glyphosate, one may conclude that this pesticide is safe towards human erythrocytes.

Recently, they have attracted attention due to their toxic effects on non-target organisms, especially bees. Numerous studies have shown that neonicotinoids have been found in detectable levels in the environment and cause various undesirable effects on living organisms, including humans and other mammals. In this study, the possible toxic effects of imidacloprid and acetamiprid, commonly used neonicotinoids, are investigated by their pure forms and commercial formulations on HT-29 cells with individual and combined exposures. According to our results, imidacloprid and acetamiprid induced cytotoxicity by caspasemediated apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, DNA damage, and oxidative stress under these experimental conditions.

The technical grade cypermethrin contained 92% active ingredient (a.i.) and the commercial formulation was an emulsified concentrate (EC) containing 10% a.i. (10% EC). Based on the actual concentration in water (2 h), the commercial formulation was found to be more acutely toxic to O. niloticus (96-h LC50 = 4.85 μg/L) than the technical grade cypermethrin (96-h LC50 = 9.74 μg/L). Exposure to sub-lethal concentrations (1.25, 2.5 μg/L) of commercial cypermethrin for 96 h produced stress on the fish, which was evident from the reduction of hepatic glycogen, reduction in the activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase and catalase in liver and elevation of plasma glucose level and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Exposure to these concentrations of cypermethrin for 14–28 days produced anaemia in fish. Long-term exposure (90 days) of the fish to these concentrations reduced the growth and deposition of protein and lipid in the body of fish as compared to control.It is concluded from this study that even minute concentration (1.25 μg/L) of cypermethrin (10% EC) in water can produce stress on fish.

So, in current study, the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of technical and formulated tribenuron-methyl herbicide were investigated in male rat bone-marrow cells, using the Structural Chromosomal Aberration (SCA) and micronucleus (MN) test systems. Technical and formulated tribenuron-methyl were administrated to rats as single or repeated oral doses of 5 (NOAEL), 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 b.wt. for 21 days at 48 h intervals. Results showed that repetitive dose of formulated tribenuron-methyl (100 mg a.i. kg-1 b.wt.) induced significant decrease in the mitotic activity. After repetitive doses, the frequency of total chromosomal aberrations was statistically significant (p<0.05-0.01) at two higher doses, 50 and 100 mg a.i. kg-1 b.wt. of formulated tribenuron-methyl as well as significant increase (p<0.05) at high dose (100 mg a.i. kg-1 b.wt.) of technical tribenuron-methyl. The frequency of MN was statistically significant at two higher doses, 50 (p<0.05) and 100 (p<0.01) mg a.i. kg-1 b.wt. of formulated tribenuron-methyl. Our results reveal that tribenuron-methyl has a clastogenic/genotoxic potential as measured by the bone marrow CA and MN tests in rats. The partial differences of the genotoxic effects obtained with pure and commercial tribenuron-methyl indicate that commercial formulations may contain additional hazardous compounds.

Since then, co-formulants were changed and numerous GBHs are marketed with different excipients declared as inert substances. In our study, we focused to determine acute and chronic cytotoxicity (by Aliivibrio fischeri assay) and direct hormonal activity (estrogenic and androgenic effects measured by Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLYES/BLYAS strains, respectively) of glyphosate, AMPA, polyethoxylated POE(15) and 13 GBHs from which 11 formulations do not contain polyethoxylated POE(15). Among the pure substances, neither glyphosate nor AMPA had any effects, while poly-ethoxylated POE(15) exhibited pronounced toxicity and was also estrogenic but not androgenic. Regarding the acute and chronic cytotoxicity and hormonal activity of GBHs, dilution percentages calculated from EC50 values were in the most cases by one or two order of magnitude lower than the minimum recommended dilution for agricultural and household use. Relation could not be observed between the biological effects and type of glyphosate-salts; hence toxicity could be linked to the co-formulants, which are not even declared in 3 GBHs.

Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress capability was assessed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Using an MTT assay, formulations of glyphosate (Roundup Probio), fluroxypyr (Hurler), quizalofop-p-ethyl (Targa Super) and dicamba (Hunter) were more toxic than the active ingredient alone. Metazachlor and its formulation Sultan had similar cytotoxicity profiles. Cytotoxicity profiles were comparable in immortalised human fibroblasts. Toxilight necrosis assays showed the formulation of metazachlor (Sultan50C) resulted in significant membrane disruption compared to the active ingredient. Generation of reactive oxygen species was detected for glyphosate, fluroxypyr, pendimethalin, quizalofop-p-ethyl, the formulation of 2,4-D (Anti-Liserons), and dicamba and its formulation Hunter. Further testing of quizalofop-p-ethyl and its formulation Targa Super in the ToxTracker assay system revealed that both products induced oxidative stress and an unfolded protein response.

It is present in particle form in the environment; however, no study exploring its potential health impact on airways and the respiratory system has been published. Here, the biological effect of these particles was investigated in vitro on human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-). To be close to the real-life conditions exposure, Folpan 80WGO (R), a commercial form of folpet, was tested. Folpan 80WGO particles showed dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects on 16HBE14o- cells. This effect was compared to that produced by technical-grade folpet and both were found to induce a toxicity with similar IC50 values after 24h of exposure. After 4h and at least until 48h of exposure, the IC50 values of Folpan 80WG (R) particles were between 2.4 and 2.8 mu g/cm(2). Investigation of the cytotoxicity found that Folpan 80WGO particles at 1.85 mu g/cm(2) induced an increase in ROS production from the first hour of exposure. Evidence that oxidative processes occur in folpet-exposed cells was confirmed by the presence of membrane lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, early apoptosis and late apoptosis/necrosis were both present after the first hour of exposure. These findings indicate that exposure to Folpan 80WG (R) particles result in a rapid cytotoxic effect on human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro that could be in part explained by oxidative stress, characterised by membrane lipid peroxiclation and ROS production.

Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum, non-selective herbicide and commonly used to eliminate weeds in agricultural and forest settings. Studies evaluating glyphosate toxicity in animals and environment show that commercial formulations of glyphosate are more toxic than the active component itself. Objectives. Technical grade glyphosate was compared with the commercial formulation Roundup(R) in their respective toxicities on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Materials and methods. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to different concentrations of glyphosate, either technical grade or in the form of Roundup for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. Cytotoxicity was assayed by trypan blue dye exclusion method and reduction of (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2Htetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide inner salt) XTT reagent. Results. Both technical grade glyphosate and Roundup(R) formulation were toxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cytotoxicity of Roundup(R) was higher than cytotoxicity of glyphosate, since the LC50 (50% lethal concentration) determined by the trypan blue exclusion method at 24 h was the equivalent of 56.4 mu g/ml of glyphosate in the form of Roundup(R) and 1,640 mu g/ml (1.64 mg/ml) for technical grade glyphosate. Conclusions. This in vitro study confirmed the toxic effects on human cells by glyphosate and its commercial preparations.

However, the decrease of bee's population has been observed worldwide and besides other factors, this collapse is also related to the extensive use of pesticides. In this sense, studies involving the assessment of adverse effects and the uptake of pesticides by bees are of great concern. This work presents an analytical method for the determination of the insecticide abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris exposed via oral and topic to endpoints concentrations of active ingredients (a.i.) alone and in commercial formulations and the discussion about its mortality and uptake. For this purpose, QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged and Safe) acetate modified method was used for extraction and pesticides were determined by LC-MS/MS. The validation parameters have included: a linear range between 0.01 and 1.00 mu g mL(-1); and LOD and LOQ of 0.038 and 0.076 mu g g(-1) for abamectin and difenoconazole, respectively. The uptake of tested pesticides via oral and topic was verified by the accumulation in adult forager bees, mainly when the commercial product was tested. Mortality was observed to be higher in oral exposure than in topic tests for both pesticides. For abamectin in a commercial formulation (a.i.) no differences were observed for oral or topic exposure. On the other hand, for difenoconazole, topic exposure had demonstrated higher accumulation in bees, according to the increase of received dose. Through the results, uptake and the possible consequences of bioaccumulated pesticides are also discussed and can contribute to the knowledge about the risks involving the exposure of bees to these compounds.

Laboratory and field experiments were carried out, and the effects of cypermethrin were compared with those of a 'standard insecticide', carbofuran, widely used for pest control in rice, and a 'positive control', chlorfenvinphos, expected to be toxic to fish in rice paddies at insecticidally effective rates. Acute toxicity tests in the laboratory with the technical materials on the fish Tilapia nilotica showed cypermethrin, with a 96 h LC50 value of 2 μg/ℓ, to be some 20 times more toxic than chlorfenvinphos, with a 96 h LC50 value of 39 μg/ℓ, and some 250 times more toxic than carbofuran with a 96 h LC50 of 480 μg/ℓ. The LC50 values obtained from laboratory tests with formulated products (cypermethrin EC, chlorfenvinphos granules and carbofuran granules) on T. nilotica and Cyprinus carpio were broadly in agreement with those obtained from the tests with the technical materials and confirmed C. carpio to have a similar susceptibility to that of T. nilotica. However, a field experiment carried out in paddy rice in Korea with commercial formulations and at commercial application rates showed that mortality of caged C. carpio was much less with cypermethrin (< 15%) than with chlorfenvinphos (97%) or carbofuran (67%). A second field experiment in Spain where cypermethrin was applied by air resulted in no mortality of caged C. carpio held in the paddy. It is concluded that the limited toxic effects of cypermethrin on fish in the field, when compared with those of chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran, make it acceptable for use in rice. The effects of cypermethrin were limited in comparison with those of chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran because only very low application rates of cypermethrin are needed to give pest control. The penetration of the liquid cypermethrin formulations into the water was also lower than that of the granular insecticides and, finally, cypermethrin was more rapidly lost from water. Together, these factors are sufficient to explain the minimal toxic effects of cypermethrin in the field when compared with chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran, despite its considerably higher acute toxicity determined in laboratory tests. © 1984.",1984,3,151,165,10.1016/0261-2194(84)90050-4,YES,NO,YES,n/a,old paper with no CIs.

Three different modes of exposure on the F1 generation were studied: (1) intergenerational (i.e. fish only exposed through their parents); (2) direct (i.e. fish exposed only directly) and (3) multigenerational (i.e. fish both exposed intergenerationally and directly). The impact of chemical treatments on embryo-larval development (survival, biometry and malformations), swimming behaviour, biochemical markers of oxidative stress equilibrium (TBARS and catalase), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and energy metabolism (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome-c oxidase, CCO; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH) was explored. Chemical exposure did not affect the survival of F1 embryos or malformation rates. Direct exposure to the AS induced some biometric changes, such as reduction in head size (with a 10% decrease in head length), independently of coformulants. Intergenerational exposure to the AS or the Roundup GBH increased swimming activity of the larvae, with increase of between 78 and 102% in travel speeds. Viaglif co-formulants appear to have counteracted this behavioural change. The minor changes detected in the assayed biochemical markers suggested that observed effects were not due to oxidative damage, AChE inhibition or alterations to energy metabolism. Nonetheless, multi- and intergenerational exposure to Roundup increased CS:CCO and LDH:CS ratios by 46% and 9%, respectively, with a potential modification of the aerobic-to-anaerobic energy production balance. These biochemical effects were not correlated with those observed on individual level of biological organization.

The pesticides used in this study included carbamate and organophosphates, which acts as reversible and irreversible anticholinesterases, respectively. Both enzymes were insensitive to pure carbofuran (1 mM), glyphosate (I mM) and malathion (120 muM). However, the carbamate carbofuran, in the commercial formulation Furandan 350S, inhibited ATPase and ChE activities. The organophosphate glyphosate used in the commercial preparation of Gliz 480CS(R) inhibited ATPase activity and increased cholinesterase activity. These effects are likely due to the action of adjuvant substances of the chemical formulation. The commercial formulation (Malatol 500CE) did not alter enzymes activities. Our results suggest that cholinesterase present in the slug nervous tissue has a different behavior to those identified in vertebrate nervous tissue, since it was insensitive to pure compounds, known as anticholinesterases in vertebrates.

Here we show that glyphosate is toxic to human placental JEG3 cells within 18 hr with concentrations lower than those found with agricultural use, and this effect increases with concentration and time or in the presence of Roundup adjuvants. Surprisingly, Roundup is always more toxic than its active ingredient. We tested the effects of glyphosate and Roundup at lower nontoxic concentrations on aromatase, the enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis. The glyphosate-based herbicide disrupts aromatase activity and mRNA levels and interacts with the active site of the purified enzyme, but the effects of glyphosate are facilitated by the Roundup formulation in microsomes or in cell culture.

However, the knowledge on the genotoxicity of pesticides to fish is still limited. Moreover, genotoxic studies have been almost exclusively focused on the active ingredients, whereas the effect of adjuvants is frequently ignored. Hence, the present study addressed the herbicide Roundup(A (R)), evaluating the relative contribution of the active ingredient (glyphosate) and the surfactant (polyethoxylated amine; POEA) to the genotoxicity of the commercial formulation on Anguilla anguilla. Fish were exposed to equivalent concentrations of Roundup(A (R)) (58, 116 mu g L-1), glyphosate (17.9, 35.7 mu g L-1) and POEA (9.3, 18.6 mu g L-1), during 1 and 3 days. The comet assay was applied to blood cells, either as the standard procedure, or with an extra step involving DNA lesion-specific repair enzymes in an attempt to clarify DNA damaging mechanisms. The results confirmed the genotoxicity of Roundup(A (R)), also demonstrating the genotoxic potential of glyphosate and POEA individually. Though both components contributed to the overall genotoxicity of the pesticide formulation, the sum of their individual effects was never observed, pointing out an antagonistic interaction. Although POEA is far from being considered biologically inert, it did not increase the risk associated to glyphosate when the two were combined. The analysis of oxidatively induced breaks suggested that oxidation of DNA bases was not a dominant mechanism of damage.

We investigated how the combination of the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei and a widely applied herbicide, Roundup Max (R), affected freshwater microscopic communities and water quality. Further, we compared these results with those induced by the combination of the mussel and technical-grade glyphosate. We carried out a 34-day experiment in outdoor mesocosms, applying the following six treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), the equivalent concentration of glyphosate in Roundup Max (R) (R), 100 mussels (M), the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade or formulated form (MG and MR, respectively), and control (C). Herbicides significantly increased total phosphorus in water; R and MR showed greater initial total nitrogen and ammonium. R increased picoplankton abundance and caused an eightfold increase in phytoplankton, with high turbidity values; G had a lower effect on these variables.

The sulfonylureas chlorsulfuron and rimsulfuron inhibited the growth of one of two Azospirillum and one of four Pseudomonas strains, while the imidazolinones imazapyr and imazethapyr were effective on two out of five Bacillus isolates.

Flow‐through acute toxicity testing with measured concentrations of technical‐grade fenvalerate and a 30% active ingredient emulsifiable concentrate (EC) of the insecticide was conducted. Steady‐state LC50 values were reached by 72 and 120 to 168 h, respectively, in tests with technical‐grade and EC formulations of this insecticide. Initially, technical‐grade fenvalerate was more toxic; the 96–h LC50s for technical‐grade fenvalerate and the EC were 0.69 and 0.99 μg/L, respectively. By 168 h, an LC50 of 0.75 μg/L was determined for the EC, indicating that the incipient lethalities of the two formulations were similar. Fenvalerate concentration factors and residue levels in fish showed no significant differences between formulations. Residue levels associated with mortality decreased slightly with increasing fenvalerate water concentrations and ranged (mean) from approximately 1,000 to 1,500 ng/g. Levels in fish that survived testing increased with increasing exposure concentrations and ranged from about 600 to 900 ng/g. Concentration factors of 187 to 1,860 were calculated, with a mean of 1,670, as determined from fish that survived testing. The time required to accumulate residues was greater with the EC and contributed to a significantly slower uptake rate. Slower fenvalerate uptake in the presence of emulsifiers seemingly resulted in the initially lower toxicity of the EC formulation.

To assess combined effects, glyphosate was applied in its pure form (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and in preparation Roundup Classic (R) formulated with polyethoxylated tallowamines (POEA). Standing and running surface water samples originated from Lake Balaton and River Danube between early May and mid-June of 2015. The kinetics of dissipation of glyphosate, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with UV-VIS absorbance detection or tandem mass spectrometry, was investigated under laboratory conditions in aquaria with or without the presence of biofilms. The quantity and the biofilm structure of algal biomass were determined by in vivo fluorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The presence of POEA affected the dissipation of glyphosate, and dissipation profiles differed in the investigated natural waters. Significantly higher initial concentrations of glyphosate were measured in River Danube for treatment with formulated glyphosate (101.4 +/- 6.2 mu g L-1), than with glyphosate alone (79.9 +/- 6.6 mu g L-1), and dissipation to a residual level (57.6 +/- 1.4 mu g L-1) consequently took longer (approximately by 1day). Degradation of glyphosate from the initial level (91.24 +/- 5.9 mu g L-1) in Lake Balaton was not detected. Phytotoxic effects of glyphosate, particularly if enhanced by a formulant on algal biomass, were observed. Thus, 5-18% and 11-33% of algal biomass reduction was determined in River Danube upon treatments with glyphosate and Roundup Classic (R), respectively. Corresponding biomass decreases in Lake Balaton were 1.3-13% and 9-14%, respectively, accompanied by an overall decay in the algal biofilms. In River Danube, treatments resulted in the occurrence of 1.4-5.8% of green algae in the algal biomass in 28days, while green algae were not detected in the untreated control.

This study is a systematic meta-analytical review of experimental studies on the relationship between exposure to the glyphosate (GLY) and its formulations with the formation of micronuclei (MN) to establish a quantitative estimate of the environmental risks. The natural logarithm (In) of the estimated response ratio was calculated from 81 experiments. A meta-analysis was performed on the complete data set, and individual meta-analyses were conducted after stratification by test system, class of vertebrate, exposure route, gender, endpoints, type of literature, formulation, GLY dose and exposure time. A forest plot showed an overall positive association between GLY exposure and its formulations and MN, corroborated by the cumulative effects size. Different responses were observed on mammalian and non-mammalian. Interesting results was noticed in exposure route where oral administration of GLY presented no significance. Exposure by intraperitoneal injection presented the highest MN formation. Pure GLY caused fewer effects than to commercial mixtures, but both presented mutagenic effects. The studies with males presented significant responses, while studies with females were not significant. The cumulative effects size was not clearly related to GLY dose, and was negatively related to exposure time. It can be attributed to different test systems, exposure routes and protocols analyzed. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that exposure to GLY and its formulations increases the frequency of MN formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the present study was to assess the tolerance to glyphosate (the active ingredient and a commercial formulation) of contrasting soils with (H) and without (NH) history of exposure. The hypothesis of a higher tolerance in H soils due to a sustained selection pressure on community structure was tested through the PICT approach. Results indicated that tolerance to glyphosate is not consistent with previous history of exposure to the herbicide either for the active ingredient or for a commercial formulation. Soils of H and NH sites were also characterized in order to determine to what extent they differ in their functional diversity and structure of microbial communities.

Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max (TM) (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick (TM) (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49 mg L-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick (TM). Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period. The mobility of glyphosate in the soils proved very low thus risks to aquatic ecosystems due to application of glyphosate-based herbicides may occur rather in case of direct contamination of surface water.

Bentazon is not readily adsorbed by soil and therefore it enters adjacent freshwater ecosystems, making its way to estuarine and marine waters areas. Information regarding its effects on marine ecosystems is scarce. Phytotoxicity assessments were conducted in the laboratory on the common diatom Chaetoceros gracilis using both the active ingredient and its formulated product (Basamais). The 3 day EC50 Using cell counts were, respectively, 150 mg/L and 60 mu g/L for bentazon active ingredient and for bentazon-formulated while cellular volume was increased. Although bentazon is known as a photosystem II inhibitor, it produced an increase of pigment (chlorophylls a, c, and carotenoids) content, ATP synthesis, rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and TBARS formation. Therefore, pigments cannot be used as biomarkers of toxicity.

Both zineb and azzurro activities were tested within the range of 0.1-100.0 mug/ml. Concentrations of 0.1-25.0 mug/ml of zineb or azzurro, induced a significant dose-dependent increase in SCE frequency over control values. For both test compounds, while doses ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mug/ml did not alter the rate of cell proliferation, a significant delay in cell-cycle progression was observed within the 5.0-25.0 mug/ml dose-range. A regression test showed that either the proliferative replication index or the mitotic activity of cultures decreased as a function of the pesticide concentration within the 1.0-25.0 mug/ml dose-range. Doses higher than 50.0 mug/ml were cytotoxic. SCGE assay revealed an increase in zineb-induced DNA damage by enhancing the proportion of slightly damaged cells in the 25.0-100.0 mug/ml dose-range and by increasing in a dose-dependent manner the proportion of damaged cells within the 1.0-100.0 mug/ml dose-range. Overall, image analysis showed statistically significant positive relationships between zincb concentration and DNA damage (expressed by image length and width) and between length and width of the damaged cells. In azzurro-treated cells, only when 100.00 mug/ml was employed a significant increase in the frequency of damaged cells over control values affecting the totality of the cells was observed only when 100.0 mug/ml was employed. When lower doses were employed, no DNA damage was revealed. Based on these results, the evaluation of zineb as a genotoxic/non-genotoxic compound for human health should be reconsidered.

In this study, toxicity of the four organic solvents methanol, ethanol, acetone, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea were determined. EC50 values of methanol, ethanol, acetone and DMSO against S. sclerotiorum were 13.5, 24.3, 21.8, and 20.1 mu l/ml, respectively, and EC50 values of the four solvents against B. cinerea were 20.7, 30.2, 57.2, and 20.6 mu l/ml, respectively.

The genotoxicity of the fungicides was measured by analysis of the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cell cycle progression assays. Both zineb and azzurro activities were tested within the range 0.1-100.0 mug/ml immediately after in vitro lymphocyte stimulation. Only concentrations of 50.0 and 100.0 mug/ml zineb and azzurro induced a significant increase in SCE frequency over control values. Furthermore, this genotoxicity appears to be correlated with its cytotoxicity, measured as cell cycle kinetics, since both a significant delay in cell cycle progression and a significant reduction in proliferative rate index were only observed in those cultures treated with these fungicide concentrations.

The results showed that Tordon 75D(R) (a mixture of the triisopropanolamine salts of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and its other components) impaired the oxidative functions of submitochondrial particles (SMPs). The effective concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of SMP activity (EC(50)s) for Tordon 75D(R) were in the low micromolar range for 2,4-D and picloram in the presence of the other components, while in the absence of the other components exposure to 136 times higher concentrations of the triisopropanolamine forms of 2,4-D and picloram administered as a mixture were required to inhibit the oxidative functions of SMPs. Tordon 75D(R) also significantly decreased the respiratory control ratio of intact rat liver mitochondria. The results show that the toxic effects of Tordon 75D(R) on SMPs (at the EC50) and intact rat liver mitochondria were not due to any additive or synergistic actions of a mixture of its active and other components, but rather were caused solely by the proprietary surfactant. Since mitochondria are responsible for over 90% of the energy production in all eukaryotic organisms, the use of the SMP assay provides a convenient in vitro assay for evaluating cellular toxicity and can be regarded as an informative screening assay when designing chemical products which contain mixtures of chemicals.

Contrastingly, the evaluation of active substances includes a more comprehensive set of toxicity studies. Nevertheless, mixture effects of active ingredients and co-formulants may result in increased toxicity. Therefore, we investigated effects of surface active co-formulants on the toxicity of two PPPs focussing on qualitative and quantitative toxicokinetic effects on absorption and secretion. The respective products are based on the active substances abamectin and fluroxypyr-meptyl and were tested for cytotoxicity in the presence or absence of the corresponding surfactants and co-formulants using Caco-2 cells. In addition, the effect of co-formulants on increased cellular permeation was quantified using LC-MS/MS, while potential kinetic mixture effects were addressed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements and ATPase assays. The results show that surface active co-formulants significantly increase the cytotoxicity of the investigated PPPs, leading to more than additive mixture effects. Moreover, analytical investigations show higher efflux ratios of both active substances and the metabolite fluroxypyr upon combination with certain concentrations of the surfactants. The results further point to a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of Pgp transporters by most of the surfactants as well as to increased membrane fluidity.

The herbicides showed very different behaviour in microcosms, with a rapid disappearance of diquat from the aqueous phase whereas fomesafen levels remained almost constant over time. Diquat strongly inhibited the growth of L. minor whereas fomesafen had no effect on plant growth. Presence of the adjuvant only slightly reduced the effect of the lowest concentration of diquat, probably as a result of dispersion of the herbicide at the water surface.

Regarding the mixture toxicity tests, data fitted to both reference models, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and evidenced significant deviations. After the CA fitting, dose-ratio dependent deviation had the best fit to the data, demonstrating synergism caused mainly by diuron and antagonism caused mainly by carbofuran. After fitting the IA model, a synergistic deviation represented the best fit for the diuron and carbofuran mixtures.

The sensitivity range of P. caudatum to reference substance sodium chloride was established. A preliminary risk assessment of diuron and carbofuran for Brazilian water bodies was performed. The tests indicated that toxicity of pure diuron and its commercial formulation was similar, while the commercial product carbofuran was more toxic than its pure form. In acute tests, readings were carried out at 2, 3, 4 and 6 h and showed an increase of mortality with increasing exposure time. The sensitivity of P. caudatum to NaCl ranged from 3.31 to 4.44 g L-1, averaging 3.88 g L-1.

We evaluated the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of analytical standards and commercial formulations of atrazine (2 mu g L-1) and glyphosate (65 mu g L-1), isolated and in mixture (2 + 65 mu g L-1) on the microcrustacean Daphnia magna. Through chronic exposure (21 days) of two generations, we observed effects on survival, reproductive capacity and responses of the antioxidant defense system (catalase) and biotransformation system (glutathione S-transferase). The survival of organisms was affected in the second generation (F1) with a mortality of 17% in the mixture of commercial formulations treatments. In the evaluation of the first generation (F0) we observed only effects on sexual maturation of organisms, while in the F1, changes were observed in all parameters evaluated. A statistical difference (p < 0.05) was also observed between the analytical standards and the commercial formulations for all parameters evaluated, indicating that other components present in the formulations can change the toxicity of products. We suggest that atrazine can modulate toxicity when mixed with glyphosate, as the standard analytical atrazine and mixture of analytical standards results were similar in most parameters. Given the difficulty in estimating effects of mixtures and considering that various stressors are found in the environment, our results support the need to carry out long-term studies and, above all, to verify what are the impacts across generations, so that the toxicity of products is not underestimated.

In this study, quintozene and a formulation of quintozene widely used on golf Courses, FFII (TM) were tested for toxicity to early life stages of the Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes. For medaka exposed in static non-renewal assays to quintozene for 17 d from the fertilized egg stage to yolk resorption at the fry stage, the LC50 for mortality was a nominal concentration of 707 mu g l(-1) and the effective concentration for 50% hatch (i.e. EC50) was a nominal concentration of 71 mu g l(-1). Eggs and fry showed developmental abnormalities, including ocular malformations and retarded development of the brain, notochord, organs and body segmentation, which were interpreted as teratogenic responses to exposure to PCNB. For medaka exposed to quintozene, the LOECs for abnormalities of the eye and all other developmental abnormalities were 750 and 100 mu g l(-1), respectively. In medaka exposed to the FFII (TM) formulation, similar patterns of mortalities, reduced hatching success and developmental abnormalities were observed, but at higher test concentrations that were consistent with the proportion of quintozene in the formulation. For medaka exposed to the formulation, the LOECs for abnormalities of the eye and all other developmental abnormalities were 10000 and 1000 mu g l(-1), respectively.

We carried out two experiments using microcosms under laboratory conditions for 7 days each. In the first experiment, we analyzed changes in species composition, abundance and chlorophyll a of phytoplankton due to 10 treatments: control; low, medium and high concentrations of G and 2,4-D; and mixtures at low, medium and high concentrations at a G:2,4-D ratio of 1:0.45. In the second experiment we studied changes on the composition of the autotrophic fraction and abundance, chlorophyll a, dry weight (DW), ash free dry weight (AFDW) and autotrophic index of periphyton developed in artificial substrata under 7 treatments considering the lowest doses that showed an effect in the previous phytoplankton experiment: control; pure G and Glifosato Atanor (R) (glyphosate-based formulation); pure 2,4-D and Asi Max 50 (R) (2,4-D based formulation); mixtures of the a.i at a G:2,4-D ratio of 1:0.45, and mixture of Glifosato Atanor(.)(R) + Asi Max (R). Results showed that G was more toxic than 2,4-D to the algal fraction, decreasing chlorophyll a, turbidity and algal abundances in the phytoplankton experiment. The effects of the mixture on phytoplankton were mainly additive, except for total and Staurastrum sp. live abundances where an antagonistic effect between herbicides was recorded. Periphyton showed more resistance to the herbicides as it was less affected than phytoplankton by the active ingredients and commercial formulations. The high development of Leptolyngbya sp. due to the impact of the herbicide mixture on periphyton might represent the beginning of a more conspicuous community to prevent the impact of contaminants.

This is also the situation in Argentina, where glyphosate formulations are the most commercialized herbicides. It is known that glyphosate formulations are much more toxic than the active ingredient, and this difference in toxicity can be attributed to the adjuvants present in the formula. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare sub-lethal histological effects of the glyphosate formulation Roundup Ultramax and glyphosate active ingredient on Leptodactylus latrans tadpoles at Gosner-stage 36. Semi-static bioassays were performed using 96 h of exposure with Roundup Ultramax formulation (RU; 0.37-5.25 mg a.e./L.), glyphosate (GLY; 3-300 mg/L), and a control group. RU exposure showed an increment in the melanomacrophagic cells (MMc) and melanomacrophagic centers (MMCs) from 0.37 mg a.e./L. GLY exposure showed a significant increment in the number of MMc from 15 mg/L, and of MMCs from 3 mg/L. Also, histopathological lesions were observed in the liver of tadpoles exposed to both, GLY and RU. These lesions included: lipidosis and hepatic congestion, but only RU showed significant differences respect to control, with a LOEC value of 2.22 mg a.e./L for both effects. In sum, this study represents the first evidence of adverse effects of glyphosate and RU formulation on the liver of anuran larvae at concentrations frequently found in the environment.

Research suggests both Roundup and glyphosate induce oxidative stress in fish and may also cause reproductive toxicity in mammalian systems. We aimed to investigate the reproductive effects of Roundup and glyphosate in fish and the potential associated mechanisms of toxicity. To do this, we conducted a 21-day exposure of breeding zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0.01, 0.5, and 10 mg/L (glyphosate acid equivalent) Roundup and 10 mg/L glyphosate. 10 mg/L glyphosate reduced egg production but not fertilization rate in breeding colonies. Both 10 mg/L Roundup and glyphosate increased early stage embryo mortalities and premature hatching. However, exposure during embryogenesis alone did not increase embryo mortality, suggesting that this effect Was caused primarily by exposure during gametogenesis. Transcript profiling of the gonads revealed 10 mg/L Roundup and glyphosate induced changes in the expression of cyp19a1 and esr1 in the ovary and hsd3b2, cat, and sod1 in the testis.

Roundup Original (R) (RO) contains an isopropylamine glyphosate (GLY) salt containing the surfactant POEA, while Roundup Transorb R (R) (RTR) contains a potassium salt of GLY with unknown surfactants. Both contain different compositions of so-called inert ingredients, more toxic than glyphosate. Amphibian tadpoles often experience variations in O-2 availability in their aquatic habitats; an ability to tolerate hypoxia can condition their survival and fitness. We evaluated the impacts of sublethal concentrations of GLY (1 mg L-1), RO (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) and RTR (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) on metabolic rate ((V)over dot O-2 - mLO(2) Kg1 h(-1)) of bullfrog tadpoles during normoxia and graded hypoxia, and related this to morphology of their skin, their major site of gas exchange. In control (CT) (V)over dot O-2 remained unaltered from normoxia until 40 mmHg, indicating a critical O-2 tension between 40 and 20 mmHg. GLY significantly reduced (V)over dot O-2, possibly due to epidermal hypertrophy, which increased O-2 diffusion distance to O-2 uptake. In contrast, RTR increased (V)over dot O-2 during hypoxia, indicating an influence of inert compounds and surfactants. (V)over dot O-2 of RO did not differ from CT, suggesting that any increase in (V)over dot O-2 caused by exposure was antagonized by epidermal hypertrophy. Indeed, all herbicides caused marked alterations in skin morphology, with cell and epithelium wall presenting hyperplasia or hypertrophy and chromatid rupture. In summary, GLY, RO and RTR exert different effects in bullfrog tadpoles, in particular the surfactants and inert compounds appear to influence oxygen uptake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the toxicity of glyphosate, its by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and two commercial formulations, Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and Roundup Allees et Terrasses (R) (R-AT), containing glyphosate as the active ingredient, on the early life stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h. Experiments involving both endpoints included range finding experiments for herbicide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100,000 mu g L-1. This range was then narrowed down in order to determine precise EC50 values. Actual concentrations of the herbicide were determined at the beginning and after 48 h (embryotoxicity) and 24 h (metamorphosis) to evaluate the potential temporal variation in the concentrations. During embryo-larval development, no mortalities were recorded at any of the concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, whereas no embryos or D-shaped larvae could be observed after exposure to 10,000 mu g L-1 of R-EX or R-AT. Compared with the controls, no effects on embryo-larval development were recorded between 0.1 and 1000 mu g L-1, regardless of the chemical tested. Above a threshold, which varied according to the chemical used, the gradient of herbicide concentrations correlated with a gradient of severity of abnormality ranging from normal larvae to arrested development (an old embryo stage). The EC50 values were 28,315 and 40,617 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and its metabolite, respectively, but much lowered values of 1133 and 1675 mu g L-1 for R-EX and R-AT, respectively. Metamorphosis tests also revealed a significant difference between molecules, as the EC50 values exceeded 100,000 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and AMPA but were as low as 6366 and 6060 mu g L-1 for the commercial formulations, which appeared relatively more toxic. Overall, the embryo-larval development of C. gigas was more sensitive to glyphosate-based herbicides compared to various endpoints studied in regulatory model organisms, and embryos and D-shaped larvae were more sensitive compared to pediveliger larvae.

They have been shown to affect survival, growth, development and sexual differentiation of tadpoles under chronic laboratory exposures but this has not been investigated under more environmentally realistic conditions. The purpose of this study is (1) to determine if an agriculturally relevant exposure to Roundup WeatherMax®, a relatively new and understudied formulation, influences the development of wood frog tadpoles ( Lithobates sylvaticus) through effects on the mRNA levels of genes involved in the control of metamorphosis; (2) to compare results to the well-studied Vision® formulation (containing the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate [IPA] and polyethoxylated tallowamine [POEA] surfactant) and to determine which ingredient(s) in the formulations are responsible for potential effects on development; and (3) to compare results to recent field studies that used a similar experimental design. In the present laboratory study, wood frog tadpoles were exposed to an agriculturally relevant application (i.e., two pulses) of Roundup WeatherMax® and Vision® herbicides as well as the active ingredient (IPA) and the POEA surfactant of Vision®. Survival, development, growth, sex ratios and mRNA levels of genes involved in tadpole metamorphosis were measured. Results show that Roundup WeatherMax® (2.89. mg acid equivalent (a.e.)/L) caused 100% mortality after the first pulse. Tadpoles treated with a lower concentration of Roundup WeatherMax® (0.21. mg a.e./L) as well as Vision® (2.89. mg a.e./L), IPA and POEA had an increased condition factor (based on length and weight measures in the tadpoles) relative to controls at Gosner stage (Gs) 36/38. At Gs42, tadpoles treated with IPA and POEA had a decreased condition factor. Also at Gs42, the effect on condition factor was dependent on the sex of tadpoles and significant treatment effects were only detected in males. In most cases, treatment reduced the normal mRNA increase of key genes controlling development in tadpoles between Gs37 and Gs42, such as genes encoding thyroid hormone receptor beta in brain, glucocorticoid receptor in tail and deiodinase enzyme in brain and tail. We conclude that glyphosate-based herbicides have the potential to alter mRNA profiles during metamorphosis. However, studies in natural systems have yet to replicate these negative effects, which highlight the need for more ecologically relevant studies for risk assessment. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,154,291,303,10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.05.025,YES,NO,NO,GROWTH/DEVELOPMENT,one concentration of each pesticide tested

This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of pure glyphosate or Roundup on pregnant mice and their fetuses during pregnancy. From gestation days (GDs) 1-19, ICR mice were orally administered distilled water, 0.5% glyphosate solution or 0.5%-glyphosate Roundup (R) solution. The ovaries and serum were collected at GD19. The results showed decreases in body weight gain and, ovary and liver weight in glyphosate-treated mice. Additionally, histopathological alterations in the ovary including increased atretic follicles, interstitial fibrosis and decreased mature follicles were observed in the groups treated with glyphosate. The serum concentrations of both progesterone and estrogen were markedly altered after glyphosate exposure, and there were also changes in the expression of GnRH, LHR, FSHR, 3 beta-HSD and Cyp19a1 genes at the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Furthermore, oxidative stress was observed in the treated mice, increasing the activity of T-AOC, CAT and GSH-Px, as well as the MDA content in both the serum and ovary. With regard to litters, the sex ratio was significantly altered by pure glyphosate. These results show that glyphosate is able to cause several effects on pregnant mice, such as ovarian failure, interference with hormone secretion by affecting the steroidogenesis-related gene expression, and oxidative stress. The sex ratio of litters was also influenced by prenatal exposure to pure glyphosate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the toxicity of the metals Cu, Pb and Zn, the herbicide glyphosate (active product and ATANOR® formulation) and their binary combinations, was assessed on two green algae species (the standard species Raphidocelis subcapitata and a native strain of Scenedesmus acutus isolated from Burgos Stream [Buenos Aires]). The bioassays were carried out applying a concentration range of 0.5 mg L - 20 mg/L, in incubations lasting 7 days after which the algal density was estimated. To obtain the effective concentrations inhibiting 10, 20 and 50% of the growth (EC10, EC20 and EC50) of individual substances and their combinations, the percentage of growth inhibition (%I) was modeled as a function of each concentration by a nonlinear fit. According to the EC50 obtained for each species, the toxicity of Cu and Zn was higher in R. subcapitata (7.47±2.14 and 6.51±2.26 mg/L, respectively) than in S. acutus (10.90±3.75 and> 20 mg/L), while Pb and glyphosate active compound were not toxic for neither of the two strains. ATANOR® glyphosate was toxic only to R. subcapitata (EC50=12.00±3.10 mg/L). According to the EC10 and EC20 values of the individual substances and the binary combinations, S. acutus showed higher sensitivity than R. subcapitata. From the analysis of toxic units (TU), the combinatios Cu+Zn, Cu+glyphosate ATANOR® and Zn+glyphosate ATANOR® showed antagonistic effects on R. subcapitata (according to the TU values obtained from EC20 and EC50), while the Cu+Pb and Cu+Zn combinations showed synergistic and antagonistic effects, respectively, on S. acutus (according to the TU values obtained from the EC20). These results highlight the importance of conducting bioassays of toxic substances using native algal strains which allow inferring potential effects in native communities and food webs. © 2021, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

In this work, our aim was to investigate side effects of imidacloprid treatment, either applied alone or in combination with organosilicone compounds, against Chrysoperla nipponensis, an important predator of aphids. Four types of organosilicones were mixed with imidacloprid at different concentrations. The toxicity of the mixture to C. nipponensis was measured under laboratory conditions. The LC50 and LC30 of imidacloprid applied alone and in combination with 0.05% organosilicone were determined. Imidacloprid (LC30) applied alone or in combination with 0.05% organosilicone was used to treat second instar larvae of C. nipponensis; thereafter, its effects on the growth, development, longevity, reproduction, and predatory ability of C. nipponensis were evaluated The results demonstrated that the organosilicone Silwet L-77 reduced the LC50 and LC30 of imidacloprid to 6.09 (95% CI: 2.31-9.42) and 10.95 mg/L (95% CI: 8.16-13.63), respectively, and enhanced imidacloprid toxicity to C. nipponensis, as reflected by the resulting extension of the growth and developmental period, reduction in female longevity, and inhibition of reproduction. When applied alone or in combination with an organosilicone, imidacloprid reduced the consumption of Corcyra cephalonica eggs by C. nipponensis. The functional response of C. nipponensis treated with imidacloprid alone or in combination with organosilicone was type II.

Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C), 500 ng L-1 (P500), 800 ng L-1 (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl at 500 ng L-1 (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the high presence of herbicide in fish (613 +/- 163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore, antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following chronic exposure to 800 ng L-1 of pendimethalin concentration. While the glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water, while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with control.

Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: i) control (C), ii) AS at 500ngL -1 (P500), iii) AS at 800ngL -1 (P800) and iv) Prowl 400® at 500ngL -1 (Pw). After a 28day exposure period (D28), 10 fish were sampled for each condition and 10 other after a 15day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). Pendimethalin concentrations in the exposure water and muscles were followed. White blood cell counts, differential leucocyte counts, cell mortality and phagocytosis activity were measured. Haemolytic alternative complement activity, lysozyme concentration and stress parameters were analyzed.The resulting concentration of pendimethalin in the exposure water was lower than the expected concentration. At D28, the concentration quantified in the contaminated fish was negligible in comparison with the Reference Dose for Oral Exposure estimated by US-EPA's Integrated Risk Information System. Leucopenia was noted in all contaminated fish. A decrease in phagocytosis activity and ACH 50 was also observed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. Disturbed lysozyme activity was noted only in fish exposed to Pw. Furthermore, during exposure to a similar concentration of pendimethalin, the commercial product seemed to be more immunotoxic than the AS alone. Finally, at D43, the effects proved reversible for sanitary status while immunity was still disturbed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. © 2012.",2012,424,143,152,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.02.055,NO,NO,NO,PHYSIOLOGY/STRESS/IMMUNE,n/a

Therefore, the effects of the herbicide isoproturon (IPU) on the early life stages of the fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) and the closely related yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata) were investigated. The results of the exposure with 14C-labelled IPU (1 μg/L) indicated an uptake into the spawn and tadpoles of both Bombina species. The jelly capsules could not protect the embryo from effects of the herbicide. Tadpoles with complete opercula and without external gills were most sensitive to contamination by IPU. Physical and behavioral abnormalities of the tadpoles developed at concentrations, of 0.1 μg/L after 24 h exposure. At increasing IPU-concentrations the number of impaired and dead tadpoles increased significantly compared to the control. The enzymatic system of the Glutathion S-Transferase (GST) of the Bombina tadpoles were influenced significantly by the duration and concentration of IPU exposure. Compared to the pure active ingredient IPU, the commercial herbicide TOLKAN FLO® provoked a stronger enzymatic response in the tadpoles.

However, the impacts of low-level 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicide exposure on larval fish are not well understood. We conducted a series of experiments to determine the effects of low concentrations (0.05, 0.50, and 2.00ppm) of 2 commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide formulations (Weedestroy (R) AM40 [WAM40] and DMA (R) 4 IVM [DMA4]) and pure 2,4-D on the development and survival of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) at various life cycle stages. Larval survival (30 d post hatch [dph]) was decreased following exposure of eggs and larvae to pure 2,4-D (0.50ppm; p 0.001), as well as to WAM40 (0.50 and 2.00ppm; p 0.001, p 0.001) and DMA4 (0.50 and 2.00ppm; p 0.001, p 0.001). The results also narrowed the critical window of exposure for effects on survival to the period between fertilization and 14 dph. Development was not negatively altered by any of the compounds tested, although the commercial formulations increased larval total length and mass at 2.00ppm. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems at current recommended concentrations could present risks to fathead minnow larval survival.

However, natural systems are complex and biological communities diverse. The organophosphate pesticide propetamphos (PPT) has been found exceeding regulatory limits (100 ng L-1) in rivers. We address whether solution properties affect the fate of Analar (Analar-PPT) or industrial PPT (PPT-Ind) propetamphos formulations and whether propetamphos and metal toxicant effects are additive, antagonistic or synergistic? The sorption, desorption, biodegradation and microbial toxicology of Analar-PPT and PPT-Ind were investigated in Conwy River and estuary sediment. Results showed elevated salinity enhanced PPT sorption, while higher salinities increased PPT-Ind retention. Higher dissolved organic matter (DOM) and low salinity slowed Analar-PVT biodegradation (1.9 x 10(-3) h(-1)). Analar-PPT and PPT-Ind biodegradation was further reduced by low salinity, high DOM and dissolved Zn and Pb (6.3 x 10(-4) h(-1), 1100 h t(1/2) for Analar-PPT; 7.5 x 10(-4) h(-1), 924 h t(1/2) for PPT-Ind).

SC-0224 is the trimethylsulfonium (TMS) salt of N-(phosphonomethyl)-glycine (PMG), whereas glyphosate is commercially formulated as the isopropylamine (IPA) salt of PMG. Both formulated and technical grade forms of SC-0224 were found to be much more phytotoxic to duckweed than either formulated or technical grade forms of glyphosate. The growth inhibition caused by glyphosate was partially prevented by different combinations of the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp; whereas, the duckweed growth inhibition caused by SC-0224 could not be reduced by the same amino acid combinations. Trimethylsulfonium ion (TMS), the cationic constituent of the SC-0224 salt,and SC-0224 were found to be equally phytotoxic to duckweek indicating that the phytotoxic effects of TMS may be responsible for differences in the action of glyphosate and SC-0224 on duckweed. SC-0224 and glyphosate equally inhibited the production of anthranilate in the cell-free extract of K. pneumoniae, whereas TMS caused no inhibition.

This comprehensive study focused on the outcomes of terbuthylazine exposure at cell level in vitro, and a mice model in vivo. Experiments in vitro were conducted on whole human peripheral blood, isolated lymphocytes, and HepG2 cells exposed for 4 h to terbuthylazine at 8.00, 0.80, and 0.58 ng/mL, which is comparable with current reference values set by the European Commission in 2011. Terbuthylazine cytotoxicity was evaluated using dual fluorescent staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange on lymphocytes, and CCK-8 colorimetric assay on HepG2 cells. The levels of DNA damage were measured using alkaline and hOGG1-modified comet assays. The potency of terbuthlyazine regarding induction of oxidative stress in vitro was studied using a battery of standard oxidative stress biomarkers. The in vivo experiment was conducted on Swiss albino mice exposed to terbuthlyazine in the form of an active substance and its formulated commercial product Radazin TZ-50 at a daily dose of 0.0035 mg/kg bw for 14 days. Following exposure, the DNA damage levels in leukocytes, bone marrow, liver, and kidney cells of the treated mice were measured using an alkaline comet assay. In vitro results suggested low terbuthylazine cytotoxicity in non-target cells. The highest tested concentration (8.00 ng/mL) reduced lymphocyte viability by 15%, mostly due to apoptosis, while cytotoxic effects in HepG2 cells at the same concentration were negligible. Acute in vitro exposure of human lymphocytes and HepG2 cells to terbuthylazine resulted in low-level DNA instability, as detected by the alkaline comet assay. Further characterization of the mechanisms behind the DNA damage obtained using the hOGG1-modified comet assay indicated that oxidative DNA damage did not prevail in the overall damage. This was further confirmed by the measured levels of oxidative stress markers, which were mostly comparable to control. Results obtained in mice indicate that both the active substance and formulated commercial product of terbuthylazine produced DNA instability in all of the studied cell types. We found that DNA in liver and kidney cells was more prone to direct toxic effects of the parent compound and its metabolites than DNA in leukocytes and bone marrow cells. The overall findings suggest the formation of reactive terbuthylazine metabolites capable of inducing DNA cross-links, which hinder DNA migration. These effects were most pronounced in liver cells in vivo and HepG2 cells in vitro. To provide a more accurate explanation of the observed effects, additional research is needed.

The two formulation types differ in their active ingredient release and presumed environmental impact. In order to cover different ecological traits, two species of aquatic macrophytes - the floating monocot Lemna minor and the rooted dicot Myriophyllum aquaticum, were used as test models. The results of this study revealed differences in the sensitivity of tested plants to clomazone. Based on the most sensitive parameters, M. aquaticum proved to be more sensitive than L. minor to the technical ingredient and both formulations.

Due to the special amphipathicity of surfactants, it may have special effects on the environmental behaviors and toxic effects of other substances in the environment. There are few relevant studies at present. In this study, the effects of three surfactants on the degradation of the amide pesticide metolachlor in water-sediment system were investigated. The study found that the three surfactants had no significant effect on the degradation of metolachlor in the system at environmental concentrations. However, at critical micelle concentration, cationic surfactant octadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and nonionic surfactant nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ether promoted the degradation of metolachlor in water-sediment system. Anionic surfactant odium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) prolonged the degradation half-life of metolachlor. The presence of surfactants not only affected the environmental behavior of pesticides. When they coexisted with pesticides, the joint toxicity to aquatic organisms cannot be ignored. This study found that the combined effects of three surfactants and metolachlor on the acute developmental toxicity of zebrafish embryos were all synergistic effects. The combined effects of two ionic surfactants and metolachlor on the acute toxicity of adult zebrafish were synergistic effects. Further study showed that co-exposure of SDBS and metolachlor increased the absorption of metolachlor by zebrafish. Combined exposure of SDBS and metolachlor caused oxidative stress in brain, gill and liver of zebrafish. The results showed that the simultaneous presence of anionic surfactants and pesticides in the environment may increase the environmental risk of pesticides. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,300,,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134295,YES,NO,NO,FITNESS/OXIDATIVE STRESS,additive index approach.

Therefore, thorough assessment of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is a high-priority task. An enzyme inhibition-based assay is used in this study as a convenient and quick tool to study the effects of pesticides at the molecular level. The contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulations has been studied by analyzing effects of 7 active ingredients of pesticides (AIas) and 10 commercial formulations based on them (AIfs) on the function of a wide range of enzyme assay systems differing in complexity (single-, coupled, and three-enzyme assay systems). Results have been compared with the effects of AIas and AIfs on bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. Mostly, AIfs produce a considerably stronger inhibitory effect on the activity of enzyme assay systems and bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium than AIas, which confirms the contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulation. Results of the current study demonstrate that “inert” ingredients are not ecotoxicologically safe and can considerably augment the inhibitory effect of pesticide formulations; therefore, their use should be controlled more strictly. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of the enzymes used for assays do not show any changes in the protein structure in the presence of commercial pesticide formulations during the assay procedure. This finding suggests that pesticides produce the inhibitory effect on enzymes through other mechanisms. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,24,,,10.3390/ijms24032268,YES,NO,YES,n/a,used a bioluminescent bacteria.

wos832,Guy,YES,"Mesnage, R; Bernay, B; Seralini, GE",ethoxylated adjuvants of glyphosate based herbicides are active principles of human cell toxicity,TOXICOLOGY,"Pesticides are always used in formulations as mixtures of an active principle with adjuvants. Glyphosate, the active ingredient of the major pesticide in the world, is an herbicide supposed to be specific on plant metabolism. Its adjuvants are generally considered as inert diluents. Since side effects for all these compounds have been claimed, we studied potential active principles for toxicity on human cells for 9 glyphosate-based formulations. For this we detailed their compositions and toxicities, and as controls we used a major adjuvant (the polyethoxylated tallowamine POE-15), glyphosate alone, and a total formulation without glyphosate. This was performed after 24h exposures on hepatic (HepG2), embryonic (HEK293) and placental (JEG3) cell lines. We measured mitochondrial activities, membrane degradations, and caspases 3/7 activities. The compositions in adjuvants were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Here we demonstrate that all formulations are more toxic than glyphosate, and we separated experimentally three groups of formulations differentially toxic according to their concentrations in ethoxylated adjuvants. Among them, POE-15 clearly appears to be the most toxic principle against human cells, even if others are not excluded. It begins to be active with negative dose-dependent effects on cellular respiration and membrane integrity between 1 and 3 ppm, at environmental/occupational doses. We demonstrate in addition that POE-15 induces necrosis when its first micellization process occurs, by contrast to glyphosate which is known to promote endocrine disrupting effects after entering cells. Altogether, these results challenge the establishment of guidance values such as the acceptable daily intake of glyphosate, when these are mostly based on a long term in vivo test of glyphosate alone. Since pesticides are always used with adjuvants that could change their toxicity, the necessity to assess their whole formulations as mixtures becomes obvious. This challenges the concept of active principle of pesticides for non-target species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Strategies are sought to reduce the toxicity of this fungicide and alternative treatments are welcome. An alternative could be the use of clove oil, which has Eugenol as its major compound, and has antifungal potential against G. cingulata, however, Eugenol is susceptible to degradation processes which may compromise its efficacy. The nanoencapsulation of Mancozeb and Eugenol is a possible strategy to overcome the limitations of toxicity, solubility and instability of these compounds. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop nanoemulsions containing Mancozeb (0.1 mg/mL) and Eugenol (33 mg/mL), isolated or associated, and evaluate the safety of these formulations through cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and ecotoxicity tests. Nanoemulsions were developed by the spontaneous emulsification method, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in healthy human cells through MTT, Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and Picogreen tests, and ecotoxicity assessment was carried out using the chronic toxicity test in springtails. After preparation, the physicochemical characterization of the nanoemulsions were performed which presented mean particle size between 200 and 300 nm, polydispersity index less than 0.3, negative zeta potential and acid pH. The nanoencapsulation was able to avoid the reduction of the cell viability caused by Mancozeb, while Eugenol was shown to be safe for cell use in both free and nanostructured forms, however the association of the two active compounds showed toxicity in the higher doses of Mancozeb. In the ecotoxicity tests, both free Mancozeb and Eugenol forms presented high toxic potential for soil, whereas the nanoencapsulation of these compounds did not cause a reduction in number of springtails.

When applied, it is not used as a pure active ingredient but in the form of commercial formulations. Besides atrazine, these formulations contain other substances that might represent a risk to human health due to their mutual interactions. We evaluated the genotoxicity, apoptosis and necrosis induction of atrazine as an active ingredient, the commercial formulation Gesaprim (R), and a Gesaprim (R) adjuvant mixture without atrazine by comet and DNA diffusion assay, respectively. Human lymphocytes were treated for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 It with 0.047 mu g/ml, 0.47 mu g/ml, 4.7 mu g/ml of substances tested both in the presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activator. Atrazine did not appear to be genotoxic or to be capable of inducing apoptosis or necrosis. Unlike atrazine, Gesaprime (R) and the adjuvant mixture increased DNA damage in lymphocytes. After 5 h of treatment, it also increased the number of apoptotic cells. Metabolic activation additionally enhanced the DNA-damaging potential of Gesaprim (R) and the adjuvant mixture but did not affect atrazine genotoxicity. Thus, both assay endpoints differed significantly for the active ingredient and formulation. To evaluate the potential health risk of simultaneous exposure to adjuvants and an active ingredient, further efforts using a biomonitoring approach should be made. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Juvenile rainbow trout exposed to 2,4-D (1.64 mg/l) for 7 days had a 93-fold increase in plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) levels compared with untreated fish, while rainbow trout exposed to other pesticides alone did not show elevated vitellogenin levels compared to the control fish. When combined with surfactants, trends indicated enhanced estrogenicity for all combinations, but only 2,4-D and triclopyr caused significant induction of Vtg. Concentration-response studies demonstrated that the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOECs) for 2,4-D and triclopyr were 0.164 mg/l and 1 mg/l, respectively. In terms of measured 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), the LOECs of R-11 and TPA were 20 μg/l and 9.5 μg/l, respectively. Binary mixtures of TPA and 2,4-D showed a greater than additive estrogenic response at the lowest concentrations tested, but a less than additive response at the highest combined concentrations. Binary mixtures of TPA with triclopyr also caused greater than additive Vtg responses in two middle concentrations when compared to TPA or triclopyr alone. When trout were exposed to water collected from a site where triclopyr was used in combination with TPA, a concentration-dependent increase in Vtg expression was observed. Measured values of 4-NP were 3.7 μg/l, and triclopyr concentrations were below detection (<5 ng/l). Estradiol equivalents (EEQs) of the lake water were calculated from an estradiol concentration-response curve and were similar (8.5 ± 7.7 ng/l) to the mean values for the combined triclopyr + TPA treatments (9.9-12.2 ng/ l) in the laboratory, suggesting the estrogenicity of the water may have been due to the treatment. These results demonstrated the binary mixture of alkylphenol ethoxylate-containing surfactants with two aquatic pesticides possessed greater than additive estrogenic responses in fish under laboratory conditions and in a field setting. © The Author 2005.

Following label rate applications of Rimon 0.83EC to apple trees, average residue concentrations of the active ingredient, novaluron, were found to be 3.38 ppm in tree-collected pollen. Residues of the major co-formulant in Rimon 0.83EC, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were below the limit of detection in the field, but a growth chamber study described here found that NMP can persist in pollen for up to 7 d with average concentrations of 69.3 ppm. Concurrent larval rearing studies found novaluron and NMP to be toxic to developing honey bees at doses as low as 100 ppb and 100 ppm, respectively. Nucleus colony feeding studies found that chronic exposure to Rimon 0.83EC at doses as low as 200 ppm (18.6 ppm novaluron) can result in interruptions to brood production that can last for up to 2 wk after exposure. Taken together, these data indicate the use of Rimon 0.83EC on blooming flowers is a significant threat to honey bee reproduction, and suggest the need for more strict and clear usage guidelines. © The Author 2017.

Formulants, especially those present in Glyphogan, are more deleterious than glyphosate and thus should be considered as active principles of these pesticides. Lipid droplet accumulation after acute exposure to POEA suggests the rapid penetration and accumulation of formulants, leading to mortality after 24 h. As Sertoli cells are essential for testicular development and normal onset of spermatogenesis, disturbance of their function by glyphosate-based herbicides could contribute to disruption of reproductive function demonstrated in mammals exposed to these pesticides at a pre-pubertal stage of development.",2018,52,14,22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2018.01.002,NO,NO,NO,MITOCHONDRIAL ACTIVITY/OXIDATIVE STRESS,n/a

One such adjuvant is an ethoxylated soybean oil (ESBO). As the chemical composition of ESBO and the fractions mainly responsible for the adjuvant-effect are unknown, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the composition of ESBO applying preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep. HPLC) and to evaluate the adjuvant-effect of isolated fractions in comparison to the commercial product. By prep. HPLC, four main fractions could be determined and isolated. Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) and Zea mays (maize) were used as test species to evaluate the adjuvant effect of isolated fractions or ESBO on the herbicidal efficacy of bromoxynil octanoate, foramsulfuron & iodosul-furon, and technical grade bromoxynil potassium. Experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions and dry weight of leaves, leaf area, and quantum yield of photo-system II were evaluated as response parameters. Leaf area and dry weight responses showed that there was a tendency towards late eluting (non-polar) fractions enhancing the efficacy of hydrophilic herbicides to a higher extent than earlier eluting (polar) fractions. For example, foramsulfuron & iodo-sulfuron in combination with the most non-polar fraction resulted in a 61% lower dry weight of velvetleaf compared with the herbicide treatment without adjuvant. The analysis of quantum yield resulted in the lowest values for the treatment with bromoxynil octanoate (BO) mixed with ESBO and foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron (FI) combined with the most polar fraction, respectively. The detection of an active compound within an adjuvant could be a new direction for additive optimisation and, hence, very precise recommendations for herbicide-adjuvant mixtures might be deduced. © Eugen Ulmer KG, Stuttgart.",2012,119,208,215,10.1007/BF03356443,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,not a non-target species.

As a result, the substance is ubiquitous in surface waters. Concerns have been raised about its ecotoxicological impact, but little is known about its generational toxicity. In this study, we investigate the impact of an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate and its co-formulants on an F2 generation issued from exposed generations F0 and F1. Trans, inter and multigenerational toxicity of 1 mu gL(-1) of the active substance was evaluated on early stages of development and juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using different molecular, biochemical, immuno-hematologic, and biometric parameters, behavior analysis, and a viral challenge. Reproductive parameters of generation F1 were not affected. However, developmental toxicity in generation F2 due to glyphosate alone or co-formulated was observed with head size changes (e.g. head surface up to +10%), and metabolic disruptions (e.g. 35% reduction in cytochrome-c-oxidase). Moreover, larvae exposed transgenerationally to Viaglif and intergenerationally to glyphosate and Roundup presented a reduced response to light, potentially indicating altered escape behavior. Overall methylation was, however, not altered and further experiments using genespecific DNA metylation analyses are required. After several months, biochemical parameters measured in juvenile fish were no longer impacted, only intergenerational exposure to glyphosate drastically increased the susceptibility of rainbow trout to hematopoietic necrosis virus. This result might be due to a lower antibody response in exposed fish. In conclusion, our results show that generational exposure to glyphosate induces developmental toxicity and increases viral susceptibility. Co-formulants present in glyphosate-based herbicides canmodulate the toxicity of the active substance. Further investigations are required to study the specific mechanisms of transmission but our results suggest that both non-geneticmechanisms and exposure during germinal stage could be involved.

Thus, following application, these agrochemicals can inadvertently reach the aquatic ecosystems. Garlon((R)) is one of the most popular commercial denominations of this group of herbicides, considered as highly toxic to fish, even by its manufacturer. Although DNA is frequently regarded as a target of pesticide toxicity, the genotoxic potential of Garlon((R)) to fish remains completely unknown. Hence, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the genotoxicity of Garlon((R)) and its active ingredient (triclopyr), clarifying the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the comet assay, implemented as the standard procedure, with an extra step involving DNA lesion-specific repair enzymes (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III), was used to identify DNA damage in blood cells of Anguilla anguilla L. Short-term exposures (1 and 3 days) to Garlon((R)) and triclopyr were carried out, adopting environmentally realistic concentrations (67.6 and 270.5 mu g L-1 Garlon((R)) and 30 and 120 mu g L-1 triclopyr). The results concerning the nonspecific DNA damage proved the risk of the herbicide Garlon((R)) and its active ingredient triclopyr in both tested concentrations and exposure lengths. In addition, the higher genotoxic potential of the formulation, in comparison with the active ingredient, was demonstrated. When the additional breaks corresponding to net enzyme-sensitive sites were considered, none of the conditions revealed significant levels of oxidative damage.

Our study focused on the genotoxic effects of two herbicides on oyster gametes and embryos: glyphosate (both as an active substance and in the Roundup formulation) and diuron. France is Europe's leading consumer of agrochemical substances and as such, contamination of France's coastal waters by pesticides is a major concern. Glyphosate and diuron are among the most frequently detected herbicides in oyster production areas; as oyster is a specie with external reproduction, its gametes and embryos are in direct contact with the surrounding waters and are hence particularly exposed to these potentially dangerous substances. In the course of this study, differences in genotoxic and embryotoxic responses were observed in the various experiments, possibly due to differences in pollutant sensitivity between the tested genitor lots. Glyphosate and Roundup had no effect on oyster development at the concentrations tested, whereas diuron significantly affected embryo-larval development from the lowest tested concentration of 0.05 mu g L-1, i.e. an environmentally realistic concentration. Diuron may therefore have a significant impact on oyster recruitment rates in the natural environment. Our spermiotoxicity study revealed none of the tested herbicides to be cytotoxic for oyster spermatozoa. However, the alkaline comet assay showed diuron to have a significant genotoxic effect on oyster spermatozoa at concentrations of 0.05 mu g L-1 upwards. Conversely, no effects due to diuron exposure were observed on sperm mitochondrial function or acrosomal membrane integrity. Although our initial results showed no negative effect on sperm function, the possible impact on fertilization rate and the consequences of the transmission of damaged DNA for oyster development and physiological performances, requires further investigation.

Research has shown that glyphosate and Roundup can induce a broad range of biological effects in exposed organisms, particularly via generation of oxidative stress. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation of the global molecular mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate and Roundup for any species. We aimed to characterise and compare the global mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate and Roundup in the liver of brown trout (Salmo trutta), an ecologically and economically important vertebrate species, using RNA-seq on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. To do this, we exposed juvenile female brown trout to 0, 0.01, 0.5 and 10 mg/L of glyphosate and Roundup (glyphosate acid equivalent) for 14 days, and sequenced 6 replicate liver samples from each treatment. Results: We assembled the brown trout transcriptome using an optimised de novo approach, and subsequent differential expression analysis identified a total of 1020 differentially-regulated transcripts across all treatments. These included transcripts encoding components of the antioxidant system, a number of stress-response proteins and pro-apoptotic signalling molecules. Functional analysis also revealed over-representation of pathways involved in regulating of cell-proliferation and turnover, and up-regulation of energy metabolism and other metabolic processes. Conclusions: These transcriptional changes are consistent with generation of oxidative stress and the widespread induction of compensatory cellular stress response pathways. The mechanisms of toxicity identified were similar across both glyphosate and Roundup treatments, including for environmentally relevant concentrations.

Glyphosate alone, AMPA or Roundup® Active were administered to postpartum female rats, from P0 to P10, and their water consumption was measured daily. The immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and caspase-3 was measured in the anterior, medial preoptic, periventricular, supraoptic and lateroanterior hypothalamic nuclei of P0-P10 male pups after exposure, via lactation, to these xenobiotics. Puppies exposed to glyphosate had a moderate level of GFAP with no overlapping astrocyte processes, but this overlapping was observed after Roundup® Active or AMPA exposure. After being exposed to Roundup® Active or AMPA, PCNA-positive cells with strong immunoreactivity were found in some hypothalamic nuclei. Cells containing caspase-3 were found in all hypothalamic nuclei studied, but the labeling was stronger after Roundup® Active or AMPA exposure. Xenobiotics significantly increased the immunoreactivity area for all of the markers studied in the majority of cases (p 0.05). AMPA or Roundup® Active treated animals had a greater area of PCNA immunoreactivity than control or glyphosate alone treated animals (p 0.05). The effects observed after xenobiotic exposure were not due to increased water intake. The increased immunoreactivity areas observed for the markers studied suggest that xenobiotics induced a neuro-inflammatory response, implying increased cell proliferation, glial activation, and induction of apoptotic pathways. The findings also show that glyphosate metabolites/adjuvants and/or surfactants present in glyphosate commercial formulations had a greater effect than glyphosate alone.

Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup (R). This pesticide contains several adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers, and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio redo) is quickly gaining popularity in behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages, and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of glyphosate and Roundup on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3 days post-fertilization and adults were exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) or Roundup (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) for 96 h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup' exposure when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5 mg/L, Roundup at 0.065 or 0.5 mg/L reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5 mg/L of Roundup-treated adult zebrafish demonstrated a significant impairment in memory.

There are several formulations based on the active ingredient glyphosate (GLY) used along with other chemicals to improve the absorption and penetration in plants. The final composition of commercial GBH may modify GLY toxicological profile, potentially enhancing its neurotoxic properties. The developing nervous system is particularly susceptible to insults occurring during the early phases of development, and exposure to chemicals in this period may lead to persistent impairments on neurogenesis and differentiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-lasting effects of a sub-cytotoxic concentration, 2.5 parts per million of GBH and GLY, on the differentiation of human neuroepithelial stem cells (NES) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We treated NES cells with each compound and evaluated the effects on key cellular processes, such as proliferation and differentiation in daughter cells never directly exposed to the toxicants. We found that GBH induced a more immature neuronal profile associated to increased PAX6, NESTIN and DCX expression, and a shift in the differentiation process toward glial cell fate at the expense of mature neurons, as shown by an increase in the glial markers GFAP, GLT1, GLAST and a decrease in MAP2. Such alterations were associated to dysregulation of key genes critically involved in neurogenesis, including PAX6, HES1, HES5, and DDK1. Altogether, the data indicate that subtoxic concentrations of GBH, but not of GLY, induce long-lasting impairments on the differentiation potential of NES cells.",2022,37,2044,2057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.23549,NO,NO,NO,PROLIFERATION/DIFFERENTIATION,n/a

However, both the active ingredient and additives of the commercial formulations may adversely affect chemical and biological processes in soil. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of glyphosate and the commercial formulation (CH) on soil C, N and P dynamics, and microbial enzyme activity in two soil management conditions: a nopal plot (NP) with an history of 5 years of glyphosate application, and in an abandoned plot (AP) with a history of previous agricultural management without glyphosate applications. We performed three experiments: a) glyphosate and CH effects on phosphorus sorption by performing a non-biological P fixation experiment; b) glyphosate and CH effects on microbial activity, C, N and P dynamic, and the biodiversity of soil microorganisms in terms of biomarker fatty acids after a 27 day incubation experiment; and c) glyphosate and CH degradation was tested isolating bacteria from the incubated soil samples and growing in a defined media with potassium phosphate, glyphosate or CH as sole source of P. Our results suggested that other compounds from CH may be affecting P sorption, because when the herbicide was applied, P sorption was reduced in the NP, but in AP soil no significant effects were observed. In contrast, in the AP soil both glyphosate and the CH reduced C mineralization. Besides, CH application reduced Pmic concentration and laccase activity, but increased the specific activity of phosphonatase and phosphodiesterase in the AP soil. Additionally, the microbial community in NP soil revealed higher diversity index than the AP soil, but major changes in microbial groups were shown only when CH was applied. In vitro assay with native bacterial isolates confirmed their susceptibility to the commercial herbicide in both NP and AP soils. In conclusion, our results demonstrated changes on some processes related to soil C and P dynamics when pure glyphosate and a commercial glyphosate were applied, along with changes in microbial activity and community structure, being stronger the effects with the commercial formulation used.

While multiple studies have documented the toxicity, environmental persistence, and tendency to spread for glyphosate and Roundup (R), few studies have compared the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations to the toxicity of pure glyphosate for soil invertebrates, which contact both the herbicide and the formulations. Hundreds of formulations exist; their inert ingredients are confidential; and glyphosate persists in our food, water, and soil. In this experiment, we held glyphosate type and concentration constant, varying only formulation. Using Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R), Roundup Super Concentrate (R), and pure glyphosate, we delivered 26.3 mg glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt per kg of soil to compost worms (Eisenia fetida). We found that worms living in soil spiked with pure glyphosate lost 14.8-25.9% of their biomass and survived a stress test for 22.2-333% less time than worms living in uncontaminated soil. Worms living in soil spiked with Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R) and Roundup Super Concentrate (R) did not lose body mass and survived the stress test as well as worms living in uncontaminated soil. No contaminant affected soil microbial or fungal biomass over the 40-day period of this experiment. We suggest that the nitrates and phosphates in the formulations offset the toxic effects of glyphosate by spurring microbial growth and speeding glyphosate degradation. We also found a 26.5-41.3% reduction in fungal biomass across all treatments over the course of this experiment, suggesting that the worms consumed fungi and spores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This dilution level is far below agricultural recommendations and corresponds to low levels of residues in food or feed. The formulations have been compared to G alone and with its main metabolite AMPA or with one known adjuvant of R formulations, POEA. HUVEC primary neonate umbilical cord vein cells have been tested with 293 embryonic kidney and JEG3 placental cell lines. All R formulations cause total cell death within 24 h, through an inhibition of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity, and necrosis, by release of cytosolic adenylate kinase measuring membrane damage. They also induce apoptosis via activation of enzymatic caspases 3/7 activity. This is confirmed by characteristic DNA fragmentation, nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), and nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), which is demonstrated by DAPI in apoptotic round cells. G provokes only apoptosis, and HUVEC are 100 times more sensitive overall at this level. The deleterious effects are not proportional to G concentrations but rather depend on the nature of the adjuvants. AMPA and POEA separately and synergistically damage cell membranes like R but at different concentrations. Their mixtures are generally even more harmful with G. In conclusion, the R adjuvants like POEA change human cell permeability and amplify toxicity induced already by G, through apoptosis and necrosis. The real threshold of G toxicity must take into account the presence of adjuvants but also G metabolism and time-amplified effects or bioaccumulation. This should be discussed when analyzing the in vivo toxic actions of R. This work clearly confirms that the adjuvants in Roundup formulations are not inert. Moreover, the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death around residual levels to be expected, especially in food and feed derived from R formulation-treated crops.",2009,22,97,105,10.1021/tx800218n,NO,NO,NO,CYTOTOXICITY,n/a

The biochemical pathway for aromatic amino acid synthesis (Shikimate pathway), which is specifically inhibited by glyphosate, is shared by plants and numerous bacterial species. Several in vitro studies have shown that various groups of intestinal bacteria may be differently affected by glyphosate. Here, we present results from an animal exposure trial combining deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial community with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolic profiling of aromatic amino acids and their downstream metabolites. We found that glyphosate as well as the commercial formulation Glyfonova (R) 450 PLUS administered at up to fifty times the established European Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI = 0.5 mg/kg body weight) had very limited effects on bacterial community composition in Sprague Dawley rats during a two-week exposure trial. The effect of glyphosate on prototrophic bacterial growth was highly dependent on the availability of aromatic amino acids, suggesting that the observed limited effect on bacterial composition was due to the presence of sufficient amounts of aromatic amino acids in the intestinal environment. A strong correlation was observed between intestinal concentrations of glyphosate and intestinal pH, which may partly be explained by an observed reduction in acetic acid produced by the gut bacteria. We conclude that sufficient intestinal levels of aromatic amino acids provided by the diet alleviates the need for bacterial synthesis of aromatic amino acids and thus prevents an antimicrobial effect of glyphosate in vivo. It is however possible that the situation is different in cases of human malnutrition or in production animals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Its mechanism of action was thought to be specific only to plants and thus considered safe and non-toxic. However, mounting evidence suggests that GBHs may not be as safe as once thought as initial studies in frogs suggest that GBHs may be teratogenic. Here we utilize the zebrafish vertebrate model system to study early effects of glyphosate exposure using technical grade glyphosate and the Roundup (R) Classic formulation. We find morphological abnormalities including cephalic and eye reductions and a loss of delineated brain ventricles. Concomitant with structural changes in the developing brain, using in situ hybridization analysis, we detect decreases in genes expressed in the eye, fore and midbrain regions of the brain including pax2, pax6, otx2 and ephA4. However, we do not detect changes in hindbrain expression domains of ephA4 nor exclusive hindbrain markers krox-20 and hoxb1a. Additionally, using a Retinoic Acid (RA) mediated reporter transgenic, we detect no alterations in the RA expression domains in the hindbrain and spinal cord, but do detect a loss of expression in the retina.

So, the present work was conducted to study the haemato-biochemical effects of technical and formulated cypermethrin (25.0 mg kg-1 b.wt.) and deltamethrin (1.70 mg kg-1 b.wt.), in male rats given repetitive oral doses for 90 consecutive days. There was high significant decrease (p<0.01) in body weight gain of cypermethrin and significant decrease (p<0.05) in deltamethrin treated rats. The relative liver and kidney weights were significantly change in the treatments of formulated and technical cypermethrin and deltamethrin compared to the control. Deltamethrin as technical or formulated form caused significant changes (p<0.01) in haemoglobin, packed cell value and Red Blood Cell (RBC), while formulated and technical cypermethrin caused significant decrease (p<0.05) in PCV % and formulated cypermethrin induced significant decrease (p<0.01) in White Blood Cell (WBC) compared to control value. Treatments with formulated and technical cypermethrin and deltamethrin caused significant increase (p<0.01) in serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) activities and formulated cypermethrin seemed to induce higher AST elevation (200.67 IU L-1) and formulated deltamethrin induce higher ALT elevation (105.07 IU L-1) as compared with the untreated group (21.30 and 25.50 IU L-1, respectively). Technical cypermethrin and deltamethrin caused highly significant (p<0.01) decreased in serum glucose. On the other hand all of the tested insecticides induced significant decreases (p<0.05) in serum total protein and increase (p<0.05-0.01) in creatinine and uric acid concentrations. The partial differences of hematological and biochemical effects obtained with pure and commercial deltamethrin and cypermethrin indicate that commercial formulations may contain additional hazardous compounds. Therefore, it is important in assessing the real human hazard from pesticides to investigate not only the active principle but also the commercial formulations used in agriculture. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.",2012,7,312,321,10.3923/jpt.2012.312.321,NO,NO,NO,FITNESS/HAEMATOLOGICAL/BIOCHEMICAL,n/a

We found out, that imidacloprid was not highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial product. Imidacloprid was found persistent in water samples and not readily biodegradable in aquatic environment. Due to increased future predicted use of commercial products containing imidacloprid and the findings of this work, we recommend additional toxicity and biodegradability studies of other commercial products with imidacloprid as an active constituent.

Typhimurium and Escherichia coli were exposed to common co-formulants of formulations, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium was exposed to active ingredients dicamba, 2,4-D and glyphosate to determine what ingredients of the commercial formulations caused this effect. Coformulants Tween80 and carboxymethyl cellulose induced changes in response, but the pattern of the responses differed from the active ingredients, and effect sizes were smaller. A commercial wetting agent did not affect antibiotic responses. Active ingredients induced changes in antibiotic responses similar to those caused by complete formulations. This occurred at or below recommended application concentrations. Targeted deletion of efflux pump genes largely neutralized the adaptive response in the cases of increased survival in antibiotics, indicating that the biochemistry of induced resistance was the same for formulations and specific ingredients. We found that glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D, as well as co-formulants in commercial herbicides, induced a change in susceptibility of the potentially pathogenic bacteria E. coli and S. enterica to multiple antibiotics. This was measured using the efficiency of plating (EOP), the relative survival of the bacteria when exposed to herbicide and antibiotic, or just antibiotic, compared to survival on permissive media.

Adjuvants are used in conjunction with 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and other herbicides. Earlier pesticide applier survey results (n = 709) show that 59% of the applicators used adjuvants, and the majority of this group used paraffinic oils and/or surfactant mixtures. As a beginning effort to explore the role of adjuvants and herbicides in hormonally based reproductive effects, a prospective, controlled study was performed to analyze blood specimens from three different exposure groups (applicators using herbicides only; applicators using both herbicides and insecticides; and applicators using fumigants in addition to herbicides and insecticides; and a control group composed of other agricultural workers including organic farmers). The applicators and controls were age- and smoking-matched. Study subjects (n = 78) were tested before, during, and after completion of pesticide application season for the effects of pesticide products on hormone levels in the bloodstream. Of the applicator exposure groups examined, only the herbicide group showed significant endocrinologic differences from controls. Free testosterone levels were significantly elevated in post-season measurements (p = 0.032), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was significantly decreased at the height of the season (p = 0.016) and in the post-season (p = 0.010) as compared to controls. These endocrinologic findings are discussed in terms of their possible relationship to potential endocrine effects of herbicides, herbicide contaminants, and adjuvants. In vitro genotoxicity examination compared four different commercially available surfactant mixtures with 12 different commercial herbicide products, including six different chlorophenoxy herbicides. Only one herbicide yielded a significant dose-response curve. All four adjuvants showed positive dose-response effects.

The fungicide formulation was also composed of polyoxyethylene nonylphenol (NP-40) and methanol. Patient concerns: Severe cholestatic hepatitis developed, which led to the patient's death on day 88 of hospitalization. Post-mortem necropsy of the liver showed focal hepatocyte necrosis involving mostly the mid-zone, along with intracytoplasmic and intracanalicular cholestasis. Diagnoses: To identify the chemical responsible for hepatic injury, the cellular toxicity of all chemicals in the fungicide formulation was assessed in HepG2 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiaxol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test. Outcomes: Viability of cells treated with the surfactant NP-40 was significantly lower (P<.001), but that of cells treated with other components of the fungicide, including the active ingredient, iminoctadine triacetate, was unaffected. Fluorescence-Activated cell sorting analysis confirmed that necrosis was induced in HepG2 cells treated with 25-80μM of NP-40, while significant numbers of apoptotic cells were not detected. Lessons: NP-40 appears to be the chemical responsible for the patient's irreversible hepatic injury, accompanied by intracytoplasmic and intracanalicular cholestasis. Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

scopus199,Guy,YES,Mesnage R.; Antoniou M.N.,ignoring adjuvant toxicity falsifies the safety profile of commercial pesticides,Frontiers in Public Health,"Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal “active principle” and “other ingredients,” with the latter collectively also known as “adjuvants.” These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments. © Copyright © 2018 Mesnage and Antoniou.",2018,5,,,10.3389/fpubh.2017.00361,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,review

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 mu g/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

We evaluated the effects of acute sublethal exposure to glyphosate on rainbow trout by measuring changes in their metabolic and hemato-immunologic functions and their ability to survive a viral challenge. Juvenile fish were exposed for 96 h to 500 mu g L-1 of glyphosate through the active substance alone or two GHBs, Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Jardin (R), and fish were then infected with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. Red and white blood cell counts (RBCC and WBCC), as well as several enzymatic activities (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome-c oxidase, CCO; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH; acetylcholinesterase, AChE), were measured 96 h after chemical contamination (S1), and 96 h post-viral infection (S2). Mortality rates were monitored, and virus titers at the mortality peaks and seropositivity of the survivors were analyzed at 60 days post-viral infection (S3). Cumulative mortalities, viral titers, and seropositivity induced by virus infection were similar among conditions. Hematological analysis revealed significant increases of 30% for RBCC for Roundup at S1, and of 22% for WBCC at S2. No changes were observed in metabolic enzyme activities at S1. At S2, CCO and G6PDH activities were significantly higher than controls in all the chemically contaminated groups (+61 to 62% and +65 to 138%, respectively). LDH and AChE activities were increased for the Viaglif (p = 0.07; +55%) and for glyphosate and Roundup conditions (p < 0.05, +62 to 79%), respectively. Rainbow trout acutely exposed to glyphosate or GBHs presented no major physiological changes. Viral infection revealed disruptions. potentially modulated by co-formulants, of hematological and metabolic parameters, showing that it is essential to consider the stressful natural environment of fish in the chemical assessment.

This compound has a favorable environmental safety profile but was suspected to induce deleterious effects in aquatic organisms, with a potential effect of some associated co-formulants. This study aimed to assess the impact of direct and chronic exposure to glyphosate on the health status of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. A total of 36 genitors were exposed daily for 10 months to a dose of glyphosate representative of environmental concentrations (around 1 mu g L-1) using the AS alone or two GBHs formulations (i.e. Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Larding) and findings were compared to an unexposed control group (n = 12). The effects of chemical exposure on the reproductive capacities, hemato-immunologic functions, energetic metabolism, oxidative stress and specific biomarkers of exposure were analyzed over a period of 4 months covering spawning. A limited mortality between 15% and 30% specific to the spawning occurred under all conditions. No differences were observed in reproduction parameters i.e. mean weights, relative fertility and fecundity. Red blood cell count, hematocrit index, mean corpuscular volume and white blood cell counts were similar for all the sampling dates. Significant changes were observed two months before spawning with a 70% decrease of the proportion of macrophages in trout exposed to Viaglif only and a reduction of 35% of the phagocytic activity in fish exposed to the two GBHs. Trends towards lower levels of expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (between 38% and 66%) were detected one month after the spawning for all contaminated conditions but without being statistically significant. Biomarkers of exposure, i.e. acetylcholine esterase and carbonic anhydrase activities, were not impacted and none of the chemical contaminants disturbed the oxidative stress or metabolism parameters measured. These results suggest that a 10 months exposure of rainbow trout to a concentration of 1 mu g L-1 of glyphosate administered using the pure active substance or two GBHs did not significantly modify their global health including during the spawning period.

The commercial success of this molecule is due to its nonselectivity and its action, which would supposedly target specific biosynthetic pathways found mainly in plants. Multiple studies have however provided evidence for high sensitivity of many nontarget species to glyphosate and/or to formulations (glyphosate mixed with surfactants). This herbicide, found at significant levels in aquatic systems through surface runoffs, impacts life history traits and immune parameters of several aquatic invertebrates' species, including disease-vector mosquitoes. Mosquitoes, from hatching to emergence, are exposed to aquatic chemical contaminants. In this study, we first compared the toxicity of pure glyphosate to the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations for the main vector of avian malaria in Europe, Culex pipiens mosquito. Then we evaluated, for the first time, how field-realistic dose of glyphosate interacts with larval nutritional stress to alter mosquito life history traits and susceptibility to avian malaria parasite infection. Our results show that exposure of larvae to field-realistic doses of glyphosate, pure or in formulation, did not affect larval survival rate, adult size, and female fecundity. One of our two experimental blocks showed, however, that exposure to glyphosate decreased development time and reduced mosquito infection probability by malaria parasite. Interestingly, the effect on malaria infection was lost when the larvae were also subjected to a nutritional stress, probably due to a lower ingestion of glyphosate.",2020,10,5079,5088,10.1002/ece3.6261,YES,NO,NO,DEVELOPMENT,two concentrations of each pesticide tested

Due to the intensive use of GLY-based herbicides and their direct application on soils, some of their components, including the active ingredient, may reach the aquatic environment through direct run-off and leaching. The present study assessed the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the GLY-based formulation Atanor 48 (ATN) and its major constituents GLY, surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA), as well as the main metabolite of GLY aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) on non-target aquatic organisms. The toxic effects of these chemicals were evaluated in the fish embryo acute toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio), while genotoxic effects were investigated in the comet assays with cells from zebrafish larvae and rainbow trout gonad-2 (RTG-2). GLY and AMPA caused no acute toxic effect, while ATN and POEA induced significant lethal effects in zebrafish (LC50-96 h 76.50 mg/L and 5.49 mg/L, respectively). All compounds were genotoxic in comet experiments with zebrafish larvae (LOEC 1.7 mg/L for GLY, ATN, AMPA and 0.4 mg/L for POEA). Unlike in vivo, only POEA induced DNA damage in RTG-2 cells (LOEC 1.6 mg/L), suggesting that it is a direct acting genotoxic agent. In summary, these data indicate that the lethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages can be ranked in the following order from most to least toxic: surfactant POEA > formulation ATN > active ingredient GLY approximate to metabolite AMPA. Genotoxic effects were observed in both RTG-2 cells (only POEA) and zebrafish (all test compounds) with the lowest tested concentrations.

This study aims to investigate the functional impact of in vitro exposure of pig spermatozoa to low concentrations of Roundup (R) Ultra Plus (RUP), similar to those present as environment contaminants, to its active ingredient glyphosate, and to the non-active component, surfactant polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA). Pig spermatozoa were incubated in Tyrode's basal medium (TBM) or Tyrode's complete medium (TCM) (1 h at 38.5 degrees C) with several RUP dilutions or equivalent concentrations of glyphosate or POEA. RUP treatment causes a significant dilution-dependent decrease in sperm motility, a significant increase in plasma membrane disorganization and reduction in GSK3 beta phosphorylation (TBM) and in two PKA substrates (TBM and TCM), whereas does not affect sperm viability or mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Equivalent glyphosate concentrations do not affect any functional sperm parameters. However, POEA concentrations equivalent to RUP dilutions mimic all RUP sperm effects: decrease sperm motility in a concentration-dependent manner, increase sperm plasma membrane lipid disorder and significantly inhibit GSK3 beta phosphorylation (TBM) and two PKA substrates without affecting sperm viability or MMP. In summary, low concentrations RUP herbicide cause sperm motility impairment without affecting sperm viability. This adverse effect could be likely due to a detrimental effect in the plasma membrane lipid organization and to inhibition of phosphorylation of both, GSK3 beta and specific PKA substrates. Importantly, our results indicate that negative effects of low RUP concentrations in pig spermatozoa function are likely caused by the surfactant included in its formulation and no by its active ingredient glyphosate.

The toxicity of five household pesticides (three herbicides and two insecticides) was investigated using a bacterial cytotoxicity bioassay and an algal photosynthesis bioassay. The commercial products were up to an order of magnitude more toxic than the active ingredient(s) alone. In addition, two commercial products with the same listed active ingredients in the same ratio had a 600 x difference in potency. These results clearly demonstrate that additives in commercial formulations are significant contributors to the toxicity of household pesticides. The toxicity of pesticides in aquatic systems is therefore likely underestimated by conventional chemical monitoring and risk assessment when only the active ingredients are considered. Regulators and customers should require more clarity from pesticide manufacturers about the nature and concentrations of not only the active ingredients, but also additives used in commercial formulations.

It has been showed that atrazine is one of the most frequently detected pesticides in agricultural streams and rivers, over the past two decades. Although the toxic properties of atrazine are well known, the data on the genotoxic effects of atrazine on aquatic organisms are rather scarce. Thus, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects of atrazine and an atrazine-based herbicide (Gesaprim (R)) on a model fish species Carassius auratus L, 1758, (Pisces: Cyprinidae) using the micronucleus test and the comet assay in peripheral blood erythrocytes. Fish were exposed to 5, 10 and 15 mu g/L atrazine and to its commercial formulation for 2,4 and 6 days. Ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) at a single dose of 5 mg/L was used as positive control. Our results revealed significant increases in the frequencies of micronuclei and DNA strand breaks in erythrocytes of C. auratus, following exposure to commercial formulation of atrazine and thus demonstrated the genotoxic potential of this pesticide on fish.

Acute and chronic toxicity tests were carried out with the diuron and carbofuran active ingredients and their commercial products, Diuron Nortox (R) 500 SC and Furadan (R) 350 SC, respectively. Individual toxicity tests showed that C. silvestrii was more sensitive to both carbofuran and diuron than P. caudatum. In single exposures, both pesticides caused adverse effects to C. silvestrii in environmentally relevant concentrations (48 h EC50 = 0.001 mg L-1 and 8 d LOEC = 0.00038 mg L-1 for formulated carbofuran; 8 d LOEC < 0.05 mg L-1 for formulated diuron).

Acute and chronic exposures to diuron and carbofuran mixtures caused significant deviations of the toxicity predicted by the Concentration Addition and Independent Action reference models for both test species. For the protozoan P. caudatum, a dose-dependent deviation was verified for mortality, with synergism caused mainly by carbofuran and antagonism caused mainly by diuron. For protozoan population growth, however, an antagonistic deviation was observed when the active ingredient mixtures were tested. In the case of C. silvestrii, antagonism at low concentrations and synergism at high concentrations were revealed after acute exposure to active ingredient mixtures, whereas for reproduction an antagonistic deviation was found. Commercial formulation mixtures presented significantly higher toxicity than the active ingredient mixtures.

The frequency of ME and other erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA, i.e., lobed nuclei, binucleates or segmented nuclei, kidney-shaped nuclei, notched nuclei, and picnotic nuclei) were evaluated and compared with positive (cyclophosphamide, CP, 40 mg/L) and negative (de-chlorinated tap water) controls. The results indicate that the exposure of R. arenarum tadpoles to LY (R) induces a concentration-dependent increase in ME frequency. The ENA frequency at 48 h was also significantly higher than that in the negative control group for all the chemicals assayed (CP, LY (R) and GLA) whereas at 96 h, increases in ENA over the negative control group were found only for CP and GLA (7.5 mg/L). Our study demonstrates that the commercial formulation of a GLA-based herbicide induces micronucleus formation in R. arenarum tadpoles, in contrast to the active ingredient. According to these results, the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation played an important role in the production of genotoxic damage in erythrocytes of amphibian tadpoles.

Pasteurised grape juices were separately supplemented with tetraconazole or a commercial formulation containing 12.5% w/v of tetraconazole at two concentration levels. In addition, experiments without fungicides were developed for comparative purposes. Proteome profiles of yeasts cultured in the presence or absence of fungicide molecules were different. Independently of the fungicide treatment applied, the highest variations concerning the control sample were observed for those proteins involved in metabolic processes, especially in the metabolism of nitrogen compounds. Tetraconazole molecules altered the abundance of several enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, and ergosterol. Moreover, differences in the abundance of several enzymes of the TCA cycle were found. Changes observed were different between the active substance and the commercial formulation. Significance: The presence of fungicide residues in grape juice has direct implications on the development of the aromatic profile of the wine. These alterations could be related to changes in the secondary metabolism of yeasts. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of yeasts to fungicide residues remains quite unexplored.

Amino acids are precursors of some important higher alcohols and ethyl acetates (such as methionol, 2-phenylethanol, isoamyl alcohol or 2-phenylacetate).

However, when Linuron was analyzed for genotoxicity, negative results were obtained. An epigenetic, tumor-promoting potential was hence suspected to be responsible for the oncogenic activity of the molecule. In the absence of in vivo data concerning the tumor-promoting activity of the herbicide and being well established that tumor promoters interfere with the cell growth rate and gap-junctional permeability, the effects of technical grade Linuron and of its trade formulation (Linuron 50) on these parameters were investigated. This is especially important in the case of the formulated preparation for a correct estimate of the health hazard to humans. Cytotoxicity and gap- junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) assays were performed on the endothelial cell line F-BAE GM 7373, an in vitro cell system known to be responsive to the biological effects of tumor promoters. A time- and dose- related cytotoxic effect was found for both Linuron and Linuron 50, the latter being the far more cytotoxic of the two. However, when tested at noncytotoxic concentrations over a period of 48 h, neither Linuron nor Linuron 50 altered the capacity of F-BAE GM 7373 cells to intercommunicate.

Growth was more strongly reduced in sterile synthetic media and less reduced in sterile soil; in unsterile soil only a transient growth reduction was detectable. Sensitivity was also observed in five out of eight other species analysed. In all sensitive species tested, spontaneous resistances to PT occurred. Under sterile conditions, PTT and PT reduced rhizobial nodulation rates of PT-resistant alfalfa plants drastically; however, nitrogen fixation in the few nodules that arose was unaffected. Because of the small number of nodules, the overall fixation rate was strongly diminished. In unsterile soil, nodulation and nitrogen fixation rates were not changed, possibly because of the rapid degradation of PTT and PT in the soil. Using a herbicide as model substance it could be demonstrated that the sensitivity of R. meliloti to chemical additives in the soil can be detected by analysing its growth rate, and that even a weak impact carl influence its nodulation capacity.

Herbicide application techniques aim to maximize the amount received by vegetation, but an important percentage of the agrochemicals applied disperse in the environment. Natural habitats can be exposed directly through overspray or drift and indirectly through runoff. Agriculture expansion in conjunction with the implementation of trangenic crops, has entailed an increase in the use of herbicide formulated products as well as pesticides mixtures. In Argentina, a constant increase in transgenic soybean single-cropping (Glyphosate resistant) has occured in the last years, based mainly in economic interests. This led to a corresponding rise in glyphosate-based formulations use, including more than 170 millions liters released to the environment in the last agricultural season. The exposure of an organism to these compounds may induce a cascade of events at the individual and population levels, which are not always easy to detect and correlate with the causal agent. The detection and quantification of several events in this cascade can be used as biomarkers of exposure and undesirable effects, serving as early-warning signals of populations environmentally exposed. However, the great majority of pesticide impacts are determined from experiments conducted under laboratory conditions and including only the active ingredient of the formulated product. Results obtained from these studies do not represent current field conditions, nor effects on organisms embedded in their natural ecological contexts. In the present chapter, we present an integral approach on the effects of Glyphosate and its most widely known commercial formulation, Roundup®, on a South American caiman (Caiman latirostris). We conducted a wide evaluation at different instances including laboratory controlled condition experiments, field-like experiments and a direct evaluation of environmentally exposed populations. Analysis was done in various C. latirostris life stages including embryos, hatchlings and adults, considering different ways of exposure, and through several endpoints of different biological meaning, such as genetic damage, developmental, enzymatic and metabolic parameters. Taken all data into consideration, this approach could be highly valuable at population and community levels of this wildlife species, allowing an integral insight in the interpretation of environmental contamination processess associated to the herbicide evaluated. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Common waterhemp has become a key weed in midwestern crop production systems and is a good target for a bioherbicide that could be integrated into weed management systems. We investigated the direct effects of a range of chemical herbicides and adjuvants upon conidia of M. amaranthi and found that many herbicides and most adjuvants were strongly inhibitory to germination.

Most glyphosate products suppressed or abolished germination of M. amaranthi conidia, but by testing adjuvants commonly used in glyphosate products and technical-grade glyphosate salts, it was revealed that this inhibition was due to formulation additives and not the active ingredient.

Glyphosate-based commercial formulations contain adjuvants, making them even more toxic than the active ingredient (a.i.) itself. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater invasive species which has been found to increase glyphosate dissipation in water and to accelerate eutrophication. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capability of L. fortunei to reduce the concentration of glyphosate in two commercial formulations, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Results were compared with the decay of the a.i. alone and in presence of mussels. Evasive response and toxicity tests were performed in a first set of trials to analyze the response of L. fortunei exposed to Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Subsequently, we conducted a 21-day degradation experiment in 2.6-L microcosms applying the following treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), Glifosato Atanor (R) (A), Roundup Max (R) (R), 20 mussels in dechlorinated tap water (M), and the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade (MG) or formulated form (MA and MR) (all by triplicate).

In addition to the acceleration of glyphosate dissipation in water, there was an increase in the concentration of dissolved nutrients in water (N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) even higher than that caused by the filtering activity of the mussels, probably resulting from stress or from the degradation of glyphosate and adjuvants. We believe that a larger bioavailability of these nutrients due to glyphosate metabolization mediated by mussels would accelerate eutrophication processes in natural water bodies.

It acts by inhibiting an enzyme in an aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway specific to plants and microbes, leading to the view that it poses no risk to other organisms. However, there is growing concern that glyphosate is associated with health effects in humans and an everincreasing body of evidence that suggests potential deleterious effects on other animals including pollinating insects such as bees. Although pesticides have long been considered a factor in the decline of wild bee populations, most research on bees has focussed on demonstrating and understanding the effects of insecticides. To assess whether glyphosate poses a risk to bees, we characterised changes in survival, behaviour, sucrose solution consumption, the digestive tract proteome, and the microbiota in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris after chronic exposure to field relevant doses of technical grade glyphosate or the glyphosate-based formulation, RoundUp Optima+(R). Regardless of source, there were changes in response to glyphosate exposure in important cellular and physiological processes in the digestive tract of B. terrestris, with proteins associated with oxidative stress regulation, metabolism, cellular adhesion, the extracellular matrix, and various signalling pathways altered. Interestingly, proteins associated with endocytosis, oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, and carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism were differentially altered depending on whether the exposure source was glyphosate alone or RoundUp Optima+(R). In addition, there were alterations to the digestive tract microbiota of bees depending on the glyphosate source No impacts on survival, behaviour, or food consumption were observed.

When aclonifen and bentazone were mixed in a ratio of 1.25, an antagonism was detected at low doses and a synergism at high doses. The formulated products, mixed in the same ratio, gave the same types of effects. However, the synergism of the formulated products was stronger than that of the active ingredients and focused on the high doses inducing the death of plants. Thus, the efficacy of the formulated products would add the synergistic effect of active ingredients and a crossed effect of formulation agents. © 1995.",1995,15,593,607,10.1051/agro:19950908,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,exploring efficacy

In total, 73 binary mixtures were studied in six separate experiments. Mixtures of glyphosate and glufosinate-ammonium were less phytotoxic than predicted by ADM whether commercial formulations or technical grade products were applied.

Pregnant animals were exposed to increasing doses of the herbicide (0.01, 0.1 and 100 mg/kg/d) during gestation days 0-9, after which animals were euthanized and their blood analyzed for catalase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Number of corpora lutea and uterine implantations and resorptions were also determined. Herbicide exposure did not cause any overt signs of maternal toxicity at any of the doses administered; neither did it cause an effect on developmental parameters. Catalase activity and TBARs were not modified by herbicide exposure although TAC was significantly decreased at 100 mg/kg/d of both pure and formulated compound. Thus, 2,4-D does not seem to induce oxidative stress during early pregnancy in mice at the doses administered, indicating that this mechanism is probably not involved in mediating herbicide toxicity at these dose levels. Furthermore, since no manifestations of developmental toxicity were observed after administration of the herbicide, it is also possible that 2,4-D may not produce any early developmental toxicity at the low environmentally relevant doses tested in this animal model.

Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of the lipophilic moiety on droplet spread; surfactant phytotoxicity, and surfactant enhancement of herbicide phytotoxicity. Six different lipophilic moieties and two herbicides were evaluated on four plant species. Each lipophilic moiety was represented by two surfactants: one with a low hydrophilic:lipophilic balance (HLB) value, near 12.0, and one with a high HLB value, near 16.0. Droplet spread was greater with low than high HLB surfactants and was greatest with trimethylnonanol ethoxylate (TMN); intermediate with secondary alcohol ethoxylate (SAE) and octylphenol ethoxylate (OPE), and least with linear alcohol ethoxylate (LAE), nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE), and oxysorbic (TWN).

GLY is applied in formulated products known as glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), which could induce effects that are not predicted by toxicity assays with pure GLY. This herbicide is classified as organophosphorus compound, which is known to induce neurotoxic effects. Although this compound is classified as non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies, acute exposure to GBH causes neurological symptoms in humans. However, there is no consensus in relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of the GBH in the zebrafish Danio rerio, focusing on acute toxicity, the activity and transcript levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive species (RS) formation, and behavioral repertoire. Adult zebrafish were exposed in vivo to three concentrations of GBH Scout (R), which contained GLY in formulation (fGLY) (0.065,1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 fGLY) for 7 d, and an in vitro assay was performed using also pure GLY. Our results show that GBH induced in zebrafish brain a decrease in cell viability, inhibited mitochondrial complex enzymatic activity, modulated gene expression related to mitochondrial complexes, induced an increase in RS production, promoted hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane, and induced behavioral impairments. Together, our data contributes to the knowledge of the neurotoxic effects of GBH. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a relevant cellular response that should not be disregarded. Moreover, this study pointed to the mitochondria as an important target of GBH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus (R) (Roundup SC), Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use III (R) (Roundup RtU), and technical-grade glyphosate at low concentrations [0-1000 mu g glyphosate acid equivalent (ae) l(-1)]. Roundup formulations differ in the percent of glyphosate as active ingredient (Roundup SC, similar to 50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), allowing indirect evaluation of the influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10-1000 mu g glyphosate ae l-1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 mu g glyphosate l(-1), but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 mu g l(-1) influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments.",2018,80,130,139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.004,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,assessing stimulation not toxicity.

This study emphasises effects-directed analyses (androgen receptor (AR) activity) of such environmentally relevant mixtures. Soil, where glyphosate and 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were sprayed on Bt maize, were extracted with rainwater. This allowed to test the bio-available fraction. AR effects were measured with an in vitro reporter-gene assay using MDA-kb2 cells. The cells were exposed to: single active ingredients; formulations; environmentally relevant concentrations of the active ingredients and formulations; as well as rainwater extracts. The AR was activated by rainwater extracts from soil that received a pre- and post-emergent Roundup application. The testosterone equivalents (TTEQs) derived from AR activation exceeded international drinking water trigger values. We conclude that (i) rainwater run-off from maize sprayed with Roundup and 2,4-D contained androgen active substances and (ii) the chronic exposure to this water may cause endocrine disrupting effects in humans and aquatic life which emphasise the need for intensified monitoring of environmental water resources.

Due to its high toxicity to non -target animals, its persistence in the environment and its ability to act as an endocrine disrupting compound in fish, ES use is currently banned or restricted in many other countries. Previous studies on the cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus have shown that waterborne exposure to ES can lead to both decreased pituitary FSH content and histological alterations of testes. As gonadotropin-stimulated sex steroids release from gonads was inhibited by ES in vitro, the aim of the present study was to elucidate possible mechanisms of disruption of ES on gonadal steroidogenesis in C. dimerus, as well as compare the action of the active ingredient (AI) with that of currently used commercial formulations (CF). Testis and ovary fragments were incubated with ES (AI or CF) and/or steroidogenesis activators or precursors. Testosterone and estradiol levels were measured in the incubation media. By itself, ES did not affect hormone levels. Co-incubation with LH and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin caused a decrease of the stimulated sex steroids release. When co-incubated with precursors dehydroandrostenedione and 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone, ES did not affect the increase caused by their addition alone. No differences were observed between the Al and CFs, suggesting that the effect on steroidogenesis disruption is mainly caused by the Al. Results indicate that action of ES takes place downstream of LH-receptor activation and upstream of the studied steroidogenic enzymes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Glyphosate is marketed in numerous glyphosate-based herbicide formulations (GBHs) that include co-formulants to enhance herbicidal effect of the active ingredient, but are declared as inert substances. However, these other ingredients can have biologic activity on their own and may interact with the glyphosate in synergistic toxicity. In this study, we focused to compare the cytogenetic effect of the active ingredient glyphosate and three marketed GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480, and Glyfos) by investigating cytotoxicity with fluorescent co-labeling and WST-1 cell viability assay as well as genotoxicity with cytokinesis block micronucleus assay in isolated human mononuclear white blood cells. Glyphosate had no notable cytotoxic activity over the tested concentration range (0-10,000 mu M), whereas all the selected GBHs induced significant cell death from 1,000 mu M regardless of metabolic activation (S9). Micronucleus (MN) formation induced by glyphosate and its formulations at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (0-100 mu M) exhibited a diverse pattern. Glyphosate caused statistically significant increase of MN frequency at the highest concentration (100 mu M) after 20-h exposure. Contrarily, Roundup Mega exerted a significant genotoxic effect at 100 mu M both after 4- and 20-h exposures; moreover, Glyfos and Fozat 480 also resulted in a statistically significant increase of MN frequency from the concentration of 10 mu M after 4-h and 20-h treatment, respectively. The presence of S9 had no effect on MN formation induced by either glyphosate or GBHs. The differences observed in the cytotoxic and genotoxic pattern between the active principle and formulations confirm the previous concept that the presence of co-formulants in the formulations or the interaction of them with the active ingredient is responsible for the increased toxicity of herbicide products, and draw attention to the fact that GBHs are still currently in use, the toxicity of which rivals that of POEA-containing formulations (e.g., Glyfos) already banned in Europe.

Cells were cultured either as whole blood or isolated lymphocytes and treated with pure or commercial forms of 2,4-D at doses between 0.001 and 1 mM for 48 h. Exposure to 2,4-D produced a minimal increase in MN in whole blood and even smaller one in isolated lymphocyte cultures. This induction took place only at levels approaching cytotoxicity and was accompanied by a significant inhibition of replicative index (RI). At a low (0.005 mM) dose of commercial 2,4-D, a small, marginally significant increase in RI (12-15%) was found in two independent sets of experiments (P = 0.052). Additionally, we found that lymphocyte RI was more affected by commercial 2,4-D containing 9.4% of the chemically pure 2,4-D, than with an equal concentration of the latter suggesting that other ingredients present in the commercial pesticide may be responsible or may enhance the effect of 2,4-D.

For this, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for 238 E. coli isolates by broth microdilution in Mueller Hinton I media followed by the statistical analyses using Mann-Whitney-U test, multivariable analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a multivariable proportional-odds ordinal regression model. While the overall MIC distribution was narrow and lacked a highly resistant sub-population for both substances, statistical analyses revealed small but significant associations between glyphosate resistance levels and different factors tested. Mean MIC values for the entire dataset showed a higher level of resistance to the complete glyphosate-containing formulation (40 mg/ml IPA) than to pure glyphosate (10 mg/ml IPA) in E. coli. Isolates that originated from poultry had significantly higher MIC values for both pure glyphosate and the complete formulation. Pathogenic and non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (non-ESBL) E. coli isolates each showed significantly higher MIC values compared to commensals and ESBL-producing E. coli in pure glyphosate, but not in the complete formulation. Recently sampled isolates showed statistically higher MICs than the isolates of the historic standard E. coli collection of reference in pure glyphosate, when tested by nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test, but not in the multivariable model. Further investigations are necessary to confirm whether these associations have a casual relationship with the glyphosate use or are the consequence of co-selection due to the increased application rates of antibiotics, heavy metals or other biocides. A possible accumulation of pathogenic bacteria in livestock animals fed with glyphosate-containing feed should also be considered. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Cell viability analysis, mRNA expression, abundance of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and intracellular concentra-tions of active substances determined by LC-MS/MS analyses demonstrated that the toxicity of the PPPs is influ-enced by the presence of co-formulants in vitro. PPPs were more cytotoxic than the mix of their active substances. Gene expression profiles of cells treated with the PPPs were similar to those treated with their respective mixture combinations with marked differences. Co-formulants can cause gene expression changes on their own. LC-MS/MS analyses revealed higher intracellular concentrations of active substances in cells treated with PPPs com-pared to those treated with the respective active substances' mix. Proteomic data showed co-formulants can induce ABC transporters and CYP enzymes.

To address this issue, we investigated effects of active substances with known hepatotoxicity and two commonly used fungicides: Priori Xtra (R) and Adexar (R). For this purpose, respective active substances individually and in combination as well as the products were applied to two human hepatoma cell lines (HepaRG and HepG2) in a broad dose range.

In this study, the aim was to examine to which degree nonylphenol (NP) may interfere with the toxicity of two organophosphorus pesticides found in aquafeeds, chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) and pirimiphos-methyl (PPM). Atlantic salmon liver cells were exposed to these compounds singly or in combinations for 48 h using 3D cell cultures. Cytotoxicity, gene expression (RTqPCR), and lipidomics endpoints were used to assess toxicity. The dose-response assessment showed that NP was the most toxic compound at equimolar concentrations (100 mu M). Shotgun lipidomics pointed to a general pattern of elevated levels of saturated 18:0 fatty acids and declined levels of 18:1 monounsaturated fatty acids by the combined treatment. All three compounds had a distinct effect on membrane phospholipids, in particular on phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Lipid species patterns predicted inhibited stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) activity and increased Delta 6 desaturase (D6D) activity in co-treated cells.

Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the single substances, the mixtures, and the products were estimated from concentrationresponse curves and corrected for concentrations measured in the test medium. The comparison of the experimentally observed mixture toxicity with the toxicity predicted by the concept of concentration addition (CA) showed less than twofold deviation for all binary mixtures of the active substances and for three of the biocidal products. A more than 60-fold underestimation of the toxicity of the fourth product by the CA prediction was detected and could be explained fully by the toxicity of one formulation additive, which had been labeled as a hazardous substance. The reason for the 4.6-fold underestimation of toxicity of the fifth product could not be explained unambiguously. Overall, the FET was found to be a suitable screening tool to verify whether the toxicity of formulated wood preservatives can reliably be predicted by CA.

However, this chemical, when combined with a surfactant, is cytotoxic. In this study, the mechanism of the additive effect of glyphosate and TN-20, a common surfactant in glyphosate herbicides, was investigated. After exposure of rat H9c2 cells to glyphosate and TN-20 mixtures, following assays were performed: flow cytometry to determine the proportion of cells that underwent apoptosis and necrosis; western blotting to determine expression of mitochondrial proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax); immunological methods to evaluate translocation of cytochrome C; luminometric measurements to determine activity of caspases 3/7 and 9; and tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester assay to measure mitochondrial membrane potentials. Bcl-1 intensity decreased while Bax intensity increased with exposure to increasing TN-20 and/or glyphosate concentrations. Caspase activity increased and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased only when the cells were exposed to a mixture of both TN-20 and glyphosate, but not after exposure to either one of these compounds. The results support the possibility that mixtures of glyphosate and TN-20 aggravate mitochondrial damage and induce apoptosis and necrosis. Throughout this process, TN-20 seems to disrupt the integrity of the cellular barrier to glyphosate uptake, promoting glyphosate-mediated toxicity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,27,191,197,10.1016/j.tiv.2012.09.021,NO,NO,NO,CYTOTOXICITY,n/a

A quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted to investigate the expression of TNF-α, p53, and Caspase-3 genes. Furthermore, the effect of both forms of DZN on intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation and DNA damage was studied. The results showed that the TNF-α, p53, and Caspase-3 expression levels were increased in commercial formulationtreated mice than those treated with active ingredient form. Moreover, the commercial formulation form was able to increase ROS generation and induce DNA damage much more than the active ingredient-treated mice. The results concluded that not only the organophosphates but also the other byproducts affect the cellular responses to cytokine and apoptotic elements through alteration in the mRNA expression by increasing the levels of free radical generation. © 2020 Neama I.

The present study investigated the concentration- and time-dependent effects of TGP on hepatic cytochrome CYP1A gene expression and catalytic activity in rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). The TGP produced both a mixed-pattern response and a biphasic response for CYP1A expression following waterborne exposure. Evidence for inhibitory complex formation with cytochrome P450 may explain the occurrence of the mixed-pattern response. To further characterize the influence of TGP on CYP1A expression, a comparison was made between TGP and analytical grade propiconazole (AGP) with in vivo and in vitro assays. This comparison demonstrated that induction of the CYP1A gene resulted from unidentified compounds in TGP.

In vivo, analytical grade formulations of clotrimazole and propiconazole caused inhibition of CYP1A1 catalytic activity but did not influence hepatic CYP1A1 gene expression. In contrast, rainbow trout hepatic CYP1A1 expression following waterborne exposures to TGP exhibited a mixed-pattern response. The mixed-pattern response was characterized by inhibition of CYP1A1 catalytic activity and concurrent induction of CYP1A1 mRNA levels. Induction of CYP1A1 expression by TGP was determined to result from AhR-active compounds within the formulation.

While all tested atrazine forms affected the hatching success (11d, early development stage), the toxicity in later stages, as measured in terms of survival and reproduction (46d) showed that Gesaprim was the least toxic (EC10 ca. 200 mg kg(-1)), followed by nano_ATZ (EC10 ca. 180 mg kg(-1)) and atrazine (a.i.)

The objective of this study was to analyze potential cytotoxicity of the Roundup and its fundamental Substance (glyphosate). Albino male rats were intraperitoneally treated with sub-lethal concentration of Roundup (269.9 mg/kg) or glyphosate (134.95 mg/kg) each 2 clays, during 2 weeks. Hepatotoxicity was monitored by quantitative analysis of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, total protein, albumin, triglyceride and cholesterol. Creatinine and urea were used as the biochemical markets of kidney damages. The second aim of this study to investigate how glyphosate alone or included in herbicide Roundup affected hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels of animals as an index of antioxidant Status and oxidative stress, respectively, as well as the serum nitric oxide (NO) and alpha tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were measured. Treatment of animals with Roundup induced the leakage of hepatic intracellular enzymes, ALT, AST and ALP suggesting irreversible damage in hepatocytes starting from the first week. It was found that the effects were different on the enzymes in Roundup and glyphosate-treated groups. Significant time-dependent depletion of GSH levels and induction of oxidative stress in liver by the elevated levels of LPO, further confirmed the potential of Roundup to induce oxidative stress in hepatic tissue. However, glyphosate caused significant increases in NO levels more than Roundup after 2 weeks of treatment. Both treatments increased the level of TNF-alpha by the same manner. The results suggest that excessive antioxidant disruptor and oxidative stress is induced with Roundup than glyphosate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This methodology was based on the direct measurement of the diffuse reflectance spectra of solid samples and a multivariate calibration model (partial least squares, PLS) to determine the active principle concentration in commercial formulations. The PLS calibration set was built on using the spiked samples by mixing different amounts of pesticide standards and powdered samples. Buprofezin, Diuron and Daminozide were used as test analytes. Concentration of Buprofezin in the samples was calculated employing a 4-factors PLS calibration using the spectral information in the range between 2231-2430 and 1657-1784 nm. For Diuron determination a 1-factor PLS calibration model using the spectral range 1110-2497 nm, after a linear removed correction. Daminozide determination was carried out employing a 4-factors PLS model using the spectral information in the ranges 1644-1772 and 2014-2607 nm without baseline correction. The root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) found were 1.1, 1.7 and 0.7% (w/w) for Buprofezin, Diuron and Daminozide determination, respectively.

Nanosized encapsulated pesticides offer a variety of enhanced features including controlled release and improved efficacy. Despite the presence of nanosized capsules in current-use pesticide formulations, the analytical and toxicological implications of encapsulation are uncertain. To explore this issue quantitatively, we fractionated the capsules of a commercially available encapsulated insecticide formulation (γ-cyhalothrin active ingredient) into two size ranges: a large fraction (LF), with an average hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) of 758 nm, and a small fraction (SF), with an average HDD of 449 nm. We developed a novel extraction method demonstrating a time-dependent inhibition of γ-cyhalothrin from capsules for up to 48 h. An acute immobilization test with a freshwater macroinvertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia) revealed that the SF was significantly more toxic than both the LF and the free γ-cyhalothrin treatment (EC50 = 0.18 µg/L, 0.57 µg/L, and 0.65 µg/L, respectively). These findings highlight that encapsulation of γ-cyhalothrin mitigates hydrophobic partitioning in a time-dependent manner and influences toxicity in a size-dependent manner. Recognizing the analytical and toxicological nuances of various nanosized capsules can contribute to innovation in pesticide formulations and may lead to more comprehensive pesticide regulation. © 2019 by the authors.

However, consumers encounter exposure to complex mixtures, for example multiple pesticide residues, by consuming food such as crops, fruits or vegetables. Currently, more than 450 active substances are approved in the European Union, and there is little data on effects after combined exposure to several pesticides. Toxicological animal studies would increase enormously, if pesticide combinations had to be analyzed in vivo. Therefore, in vitro methods addressing this issue are needed. We have developed 32 immunoaffinity-based mass spectrometry assays to investigate the impact of hepatotoxic active substances on liver proteins in human HepaRG cells. Five compounds were selected based on their (dis) similar capability to modulate protein levels, and on their combined use in commercially available formulations. Four binary mixtures were prepared from these five substances and tested in different concentrations over three time points. We applied a novel statistical method to describe deviations from additivity and to detect antagonistic and synergistic effects.

Pesticides are among a number of proposed causes for these declines. Although a sizable database examining effects of pesticides on amphibians exists, the vast majority of these studies focus on toxicological effects (lethality, external malformations, etc.) at relatively high doses (parts per million). Very few studies focus on effects such as endocrine disruption at low concentrations. Further, most studies examine exposures to single chemicals only. The present study examined nine pesticides (four herbicides, two fungicides, and three insecticides) used on cornfields in the midwestern United States. Effects of each pesticide alone (0.1 ppb) or in combination were examined. In addition, we also examined atrazine and S-metolachlor combined (0.1 or 10 ppb each) and the commercial formulation Bicep II Magnum, which contains both of these herbicides. These two pesticides were examined in combination because they are persistent throughout the year in the wild. We examined larval growth and development, sex differentiation, and immune function in leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). In a follow-up study, we also examined the effects of the nine-compound mixture on plasma corticosterone levels in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). Although some of the pesticides individually inhibited larval growth and development, the pesticide mixtures had much greater effects. Larval growth and development were retarded, but most significantly, pesticide mixtures negated or reversed the typically positive correlation between time to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis observed in controls: exposed larvae that took longer to metamorphose were smaller than their counterparts that metamorphosed earlier. The nine-pesticide mixture also induced damage to the thymus, resulting in immunosuppression and contraction of flavobacterial meningitis. The study in X laevis revealed that these adverse effects may be due to an increase in plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. Although it cannot be determined whether all the pesticides in the mixture contribute to these adverse effects or whether some pesticides are effectors, some are enhancers, and some are neutral, the present study revealed that estimating ecological risk and the impact of pesticides on amphibians using studies that examine only single pesticides at high concentrations may lead to gross underestimations of the role of pesticides in amphibian declines.",2006,114,40,50,10.1289/ehp.8051,YES,NO,NO,GROWTH/DEVELOPMENT,two concentrations of each pesticide tested.

They are applied to agricultural, landscape and structural pest management by governmental agencies, private institutions and individuals. PRIs typically assess only the potential risks associated with the active ingredients because, with few exceptions, pesticide manufacturers disclose only the identity of the active ingredients which generally comprise only a minor portion of pesticide products. We show that when inert ingredients are identified and assessed by the same process as the active ingredient, the product specific risk can be much greater than that calculated for the active ingredient alone.

In this paper, acute and chronic effects of commercial neem insecticides on the aquatic invertebrate, Daphnia pulex were examined. The acute toxicity of two commercial neem insecticides, Neemix, Azatin and the experimental insecticide, RH-9999 to D. pulex was investigated using traditional 48 hr concentration-mortality estimates. Neemix and Azatin were equitoxic with LC50s of 0.68 and 0.57 ppm; RH-9999 was significantly less toxic with an LC50 of 13 ppm. A 10 d population growth study was conducted for Neemix and a Neemix formulation blank (Neemix devoid of the active ingredients) to determine whether the active ingredients of Neemix and/or components of the formulation were responsible for toxicity. D. pulex populations went to extinction after exposure to a Neemix concentration of 0.45 ppm azadirachtin (equivalent to the acute LC7). Neemix No Observable Effect Concentration (NOEC) and Lowest Observable Effect Concentration (LOEC) values for population growth were 0.045 and 0.15 ppm azadirachtin, respectively. The mean number of offspring per surviving female (Ro) declined in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to Neemix with no offspring being produced after exposure to 0.45 ppm. Neemix NOEC and LOEC values for reproduction were 0.045 and 0.15 ppm, respectively. The formulation blank caused no mortality in the individuals used to start the population growth study but reduced reproduction and population growth accounting for 47% of the toxicity caused by Neemix at a concentration of 0.15 ppm. Thus, the formulation contributes substantially to the toxicity of Neemix but neem components are also toxic to D. pulex. Because the NOEC for population growth and reproduction were higher than the estimated environmental concentration of 0.035 ppm (a measure developed for forest pest mananagement), Neemix should pose little risk to populations of D. pulex.",2001,36,457,465,http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PFC-100104189,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,comparison of interest not performed.

Herein, a commercial Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide formulation (NPF), the active ingredient of NPF (AI-NPF), the prepared Cu(OH)2 nanotubes (NT) with comparable morphology and size to AI-NPF, and CuSO4 were respectively applied to soil at normal doses (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg), followed by an application of neonicotinoid thiacloprid after an interval of 21 d, showing that NPF at doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) mitigated thiacloprid degradation compared to control and CuSO4. Furthermore, AI-NPF was the primary component that contributed to the mitigation effect of NPF, which was also validated by the NT. Large differences in the degradation efficiency of thiacloprid in sterilized and unsterilized soils with Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides suggested that biodegradation was the primary process responsible for thiacloprid degradation, especially as chemical degradation was negligible. Besides a decrease of thiacloprid bioavailability due to adsorption by Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides, we demonstrated that Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides changed soil microbial communities, reduced nitrile hydratase activity and down-regulated thiacloprid-degradative nth gene abundance, which thus mitigated thiacloprid biodegradation.

Predictions for the products and the eluates were based on the concept of concentration addition and were mostly found to provide reliable or at least protective estimates for the observed acute and chronic toxicity of the mixtures. The mixture toxicity considerations also indicated that the toxicity of each product was dominated by just 1 of the components, and that assessments based only on the dominating substance would be similarly protective as a full-mixture risk assessment. Yet, there remained uncertainty in some cases that could be related to the toxicity of transformation products, the impact of unidentified formulation additives, or synergistic interaction between active substances and formulation additives.

Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780 nor the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 was able to block the QpE-induced lipid accumulation. RNAseq analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to QpE suggests that this compound exerts its lipid accumulation effects via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)-mediated pathway, a nuclear receptor whose modulation influences lipid metabolism. QpE was further shown to be active in a PPAR gamma reporter gene assay at 100 mu M, reaching 4% of the maximal response produced by rosiglitazone, which acts as a positive control.

Still, adverse environmental and human health effects resulting from its application have been reported. In this study, the possibility of readjusting the formulation of a commercial product combining azoxystrobin and tebuconazole (active ingredients – AIs; Custodia®) towards environmentally safer alternative(s) was investigated. Specifically, the sensitivity of non-target aquatic communities to each AI was first evaluated by applying the Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) approach. Then, mixtures of these AIs were tested in a non-target organism (Raphidocelis subcapitata) denoting sensitivity to both AIs as assessed from SSDs. The resulting data supported the design of the last stage of this study, where mixtures of those AIs at equivalent vs. alternative ratios and rates as in the commercial formulation were tested against two target fungal species: Pyrenophora teres CBS 123929 and Rhynchosporium secalis CBS 110524. The comparison between the sensitivity of non-target aquatic species and the corresponding efficacy towards target fungi revealed that currently applied mixture and rates of these AIs are generally environmentally safe (antagonistic interaction; concentrations below the EC1 for R. subcapitata and generally below the HC5 for aquatic non-target communities), but ineffective against target organisms (maximum levels of inhibition of 70 and 50% in P. teres CBS 123929 and R. secalis CBS 110524, respectively). Results additionally suggest a potentiation of the effects of the AIs by the other formulants added to the commercial product at tested rates. Overall, this study corroborates that commercial products can be optimized during design stages based on a systematic ecotoxicological testing for ingredient interactions and actual efficacy against targets.

Carefully designed and un-confounded laboratory toxicity tests are crucial for accurate assessment of potential risks from the original formulation of Roundup ® to North American amphibians in aquatic environments. The formulated mixture of this herbicide as well as its components, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate and the surfactant MON 0818 (containing polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA)) were separately tested in 96h acute toxicity tests with Gosner stage 25 larval anurans. Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo fowleri, and Hyla chrysoscelis were reared from egg masses and exposed to a series of 11 concentrations of the original formulation of Roundup ® herbicide, nine concentrations of MON 0818 and three concentrations of IPA salt of glyphosate in static (non-renewal) aqueous laboratory tests. LC50 values are expressed as glyphosate acid equivalents (ae) or as mg/L for MON 0818 concentrations for comparison between the formulation and components. R. pipiens was the most sensitive of five species with 96h-LC50 values for formulation tests, for the five species, ranging from 1.80 to 4.22mg ae/L, and MON 0818 exposures with 96h-LC50 values ranging from 0.68 to 1.32mg/L. No significant mortality was observed during exposures of 96h for any of the five species exposed to glyphosate IPA salt at concentrations up to 100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). These results agree with previous studies which have noted that the surfactant MON 0818 containing POEA contributes the majority of the toxicity to the herbicide formulations for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and amphibians. These study results suggest that anurans are among the most sensitive species, and emphasize the importance of testing the herbicide formulation in addition to its separate components to accurately characterize the toxicity and potential risk of the formulation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2012,78,128,133,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.11.025,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Morphological parameters, growth rates, photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrates, lipids, ash, moisture, and protein contents were estimated. Cypermethrin at concentrations up to 20 μg.mL−1 stimulated growth rates, photosynthetic pigments, and biochemical parameters while deltamethrin showed inhibitory effects. Cypermethrin treated cells exhibited significant survivability as compared to those treated with deltamethrin. Analysis of recovered pesticides from the treated media showed the efficiency of both strains in pyrethroid removal. Pseudanabaena sp.

In the Flooding Pampa where native grasslands were not replaced by crops, glyphosate is frequently sprayed in late-summer every year to increase winter forage productivity for cattle without knowing the impacts on both aboveground and belowground grassland genetic resources. Here, we evaluated the effect of this practice on the abundance and community structure of members of the genus Pseudomonas, one of the most diverse bacterial taxa of the plant rhizosphere broadly recognized by their benefits on plant growth and protection, and on soil remediation. In a field experiment, we analyzed the impact of a single application or of a repeated annual application during 4 consecutive years of the recommended dose of commercial glyphosate (Glacoxan (R), 3 l ha(-1) and 1440 g active ingredient ha(-1)). In a greenhouse experiment, we tested whether exposure of bare soil to either commercially formulated or pure glyphosate has a direct impact on the resident pseudomonas community in the absence of plants. In the field, we found that the repeated annual herbicide application resulted in a reduction in the abundance and a shift in the community structure of culturable pseudomonads, with evidence of an enrichment of glyphosate-metabolizing lineages. On the other hand, a single application of glyphosate to bare soil under greenhouse conditions did not affect the abundance nor the community structure of pseudomonads. Considering that these plant-beneficial bacteria are natural inhabitants of the rhizosphere and that their fitness is promoted by plant root exudates, the observed alterations are most likely associated with the drop in the vegetation cover directly provoked by the effect of glyphosate. For the first time, we report on the consequences that a reiterated glyphosate application has on a diverse soil reservoir of bacteria that contributes to crucial ecosystem functions in a temperate natural grassland under animal production. Our findings strengthen the notion that this agronomical practice has an unavoidable imprint on non-target microorganisms that are relevant components of the plant-soil feedbacks and that may be instrumental for ecosystem restoration. We conclude that it is necessary to develop sustainable management practices to avoid affecting key functional microorganisms and exploit their contributions to society.",2021,319,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107503,YES,NO,NO,n/a,one concentration tested

Repeated applications are very common in the field due to increasing incidence of glyphosate resistant (GR) weeds. Although several studies have considered the effects of single applications, the information related with the impact of repeated applications on soil microbial communities is comparatively less. We designed a laboratory experiment at microcosm level to assess the impact of up to three applications of glyphosate on microbial communities of soils with (H) and without history (NH) of exposure to the herbicide. The overall bacterial community and a specific group, the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), were considered. Control microcosms (no glyphosate) and those with one, two or three applications of the active ingredient (AI, N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine potassium salt) or a commercial formulation (CF, Roundup Full II) were sampled after the final application. A higher respiratory quotient (RQ) was detected with p-coumaric acid as C source for microcosms with three applications (AI or CF) relative to the control. Estimations of abundance of amoA gene (AOB) and 16S rRNA gene (Eubacteria) using Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) indicated no effects of three applications (AI or CF). However, significant differences were detected for the CF when the abundance of AOB was related to Eubacteria. Additionally, a shift in the structure of AOB was detected after three applications of either the AI or the CF. Together these results reflect an impact of repeated exposure to glyphosate on bacterial groups involved in key processes for C and N cycling in soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Following questions yielding from a previous study, an in-depth analysis of the reproductive toxicity of the pesticide was made. Long-term exposures of Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina to Betanal (R) Expert, to each a.i. and to a customised mixture matching the a.i.s ratio within the commercial formulation were carried out, and deleterious effects in the offspring were recorded. This intended to clarify whether (1) the tested compounds induce reproductive injury; (2) there is interspecific variation in daphnids tolerance to the compounds; (3) there is an interaction between chemicals in combined treatments; and (4) the so-called inert ingredients added to the commercial formulation contribute to the toxicity of the herbicide. Generally, developmental impair was observed in both species (egg abortion and release of undeveloped embryos or dead offspring) at concentrations of any of the a.i.s below 1 mg L-1. Ethofumesate was invariably the least toxic pesticide, and D. magna tended to be of slightly higher sensitivity to the exposures compared to D. longispina. Joint exposures indicated that the a.i.s can interact, inducing more than and less than additive effects for Betanal (R) Expert and the customised a.i. mixture, respectively. This indicates that inert ingredients co-formulating the commercial pesticide (which are absent from the customised a.i. mixture) actually contribute to its overall toxicity. This study constitutes an add-on to the discussion on the ecotoxicological framework required for authorisation of pesticide trade and usage.

Acute and chronic intoxication of humans and animals, contamination of soil, water and food are the consequences of the current demand and sales of these products. In addition, pesticides such as glyphosate are sold in commercial formulations which have inert ingredients, substances with unknown composition and proportion. Facing this scenario, toxicological studies that investigate the interaction between the active principle and the inert ingredients are necessary. The following work proposed comparative toxicology studies between glyphosate and its commercial formulation using the alternative model Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms were exposed to different concentrations of the active ingredient (glyphosate in monoisopropylamine salt) and its commercial formulation. Reproductive capacity was evaluated through brood size, morphological analysis of oocytes and through the MD701 strain (bcIs39), which allows the visualization of germ cells in apoptosis. In addition, the metal composition in the commercial formulation was analyzed by ICP-MS. Only the commercial formulation of glyphosate showed significant negative effects on brood size, body length, oocyte size, and the number of apoptotic cells. Metal analysis showed the presence of Hg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb in the commercial formulation, which did not cause reprotoxicity at the concentrations found. However, metals can bio-accumulate in soil and water and cause environmental impacts. Finally, we demonstrated that the addition of inert ingredients increased the toxic profile of the active ingredient glyphosate in C. elegans, which reinforces the need of components description in the product labels.

Adverse impacts of nanofertilizers on soil microflora were reported in past studies, but only considering a single application. Repeated applications are however more likely to occur in agriculture. We investigated effects of single versus repeated applications of a copper hydroxide nanofertilizer formulation (NFF) on soil enzyme activity and bacterial community. One or three applications were performed within 21 days to achieve same final level of Cu in soil (48 mg(Cu)/kg: the recommended dose of NFF). Besides, the active ingredient (i.e., copper hydroxide nanotubes (NT)) and dispersing agent (DA) of NFF, and an ionic fertilizer (i.e., CuSO4) were examined. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and urease (URE) showed negligible changes in the activities between the control and DA treatment. Bacterial community abundance, composition and diversity exhibited similar phenomena. Exposures to copper hydroxide NFF and NT or CuSO4 enhanced the activities of FDAse and NAG, weakened the activity of URE, and showed negligible changes in the LAP activity irrespective of single and repeated applications. Concentrations of NO3--N and NH4+-N in soil were also affected by the application mode of NFF. More importantly, responses of soil bacterial community to copper hydroxide NFF were highly dependent on its application mode, whereas similar responses were observed in the CuSO4 treatment regardless of single or repeated applications. This study provided new insights into environmental risk of copper hydroxide NFF that were ignored in previous studies using a single exposure. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, GBH encompass a variety of glyphosate salts as active ingredient and different adjuvants, which differ between products. These herbicides reach water bodies and produce diverse impacts over aquatic communities. Yet, the risk assessment assays required for the approval focus mostly on active ingredients. Herein, we compared the effect of five different GBH as well as of monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (GIPA) on aquatic microbial communities from natural shallow lakes that were mixed and allowed to evolve in an outdoor pond. We performed an 8-day long assay under indoor control conditions to evaluate the effects of exposure on the structure of nano-plus microphytoplankton (net phytoplankton, with sizes between 2 and 20 mu m and >20 mu m, respectively) and picoplankton (size ranging between 0.2 and 2 mu m) communities through microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Significantly different effects were evident on the structure of microbial communities dependent on the GBH, even with herbicides sharing similar active ingredients. Each GBH evoked increases of different magnitude in bacterioplankton abundance. Furthermore, GIPA and a formulation decreased the abundance of a phycocyanin-rich (PC-rich) picocyanobacteria (Pcy) cytometric population and GIPA further altered Pcy composition. Also, two GBH increased net phytoplankton total abundance and, unlike the tested GBH, no apparent effect of GIPA was detected on this community structure. These results demonstrate that GBH effects on aquatic microbial communities should not be summarized as glyphosate effects considering that the formulations have effects beyond those exerted by the active ingredients alone. This work intends to alert on the lack of real knowledge regarding the consequences of the variety of GBH on natural aquatic ecosystems.

Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered 'bee safe' by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup(R)) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax. We used three Roundup(R) products, the consumer products Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use and Roundup(R) No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup(R) ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol(R). Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use spray bottle. Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use(R) and 30% mortality with Roundup(R) ProActive(R), over 24 hr. Weedol(R) did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup(R) No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup(R) products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup(R) products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system. These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup(R) products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited. Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them.

As an example, testing on the formulated product is waived in Europe using an assessment of data for the constituent active substance(s). This is often not the case globally, because some countries require acute toxicity tests with every formulated product, thereby triggering animal welfare concerns through unnecessary testing. A database of 383 formulated products was compiled from acute toxicity studies conducted with northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (unpublished regulatory literature). Of the 383 formulated products studied, 159 contained only active substances considered functionally nontoxic (median lethal dose [LD50] > highest dose tested). Of these, 97% had formulated product LD50 values of > 2000 mg formulated product/kg (limit dose), indicating that no new information was obtained in the formulated product study. Furthermore, defined (point estimated) LD50 values for formulated products were compared with LD50 values predicted from toxicity of the active substance(s). This demonstrated that predicted LD50 values were within 2-fold and 5-fold of the measured formulated product LD50 values in 90% and 98% of cases, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that avian acute toxicity testing of formulated products is largely unnecessary and should not be routinely required to assess avian acute toxicity. In particular, when active substances are known to be functionally nontoxic, further formulated product testing adds no further information and unnecessarily increases bird usage in testing. A further analysis highlights the fact that significant reductions (61% in this dataset) could be achieved by using a sequential testing design (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 223), as opposed to established single-stage designs.

Not only the active ingredient of the herbicide (2,4,5‐T isooctylester), but also the formulation fluid itself proved to be toxic, be it to a lower extent. The toxic action of the herbicide is mainly caused by direct contact; there was only a slight effect after application as a vapour. Juvenile springtails proved to be more susceptible than adults. The herbicide also influenced the mobility of the springtails. A high dose (0.025 ml/dm2) decreased mobility, whereas a low dose (0.003 ml/dm2) gave an increased mobility. Moreover the herbicide excercised a repellent action on springtails; these were able to avoid treated sections of the substrate, as well as to escape from them. In spite of this repellency a considerable proportion of the springtails tested died, although given the opportunity to escape. They died on the treated substrate or after escape from it. The amounts of herbicide found on the soil under and between black cherry shrubs after practical applications, varied from 0.0005 to 0.017 ml/dm2. From this and the above mentioned results of laboratory experiments, in the field side effects of the herbicide 2,4,5‐T are to be expected. Nebenwirkungen des Herbizids 2,4,5‐T auf den Springschwanz Onychiurus quadriocellatus Gisin (Collembola) Die Anwendung des Mittels 2,4,5‐T zur Bekämpfung von Prunus serotina und Betula spp. hat in den Niederlanden sowohl in Wäldern als auch in Naturreservaten in der letzten Zeit mehr und mehr zugenommen. Es stellte sich heraus, daß in Laborversuchen, wo erwachsene Tiere von Onychiurus quadriocellatus Gisin — als Vertreter der Collembolengruppe — ständig dem Einfluß des Mittels ausgesetzt waren, eine Dosis von 0,003 ml/dm2 schon eine ziemlich hohe Mortalität verursachte. Die schädliche Wirkung war dabei nicht nur der wirksamen Substanz (2,4,5‐T isooctylester) des Mittels zuzuschreiben, sondern auch den Formulierungsbestandteilen. Die Toxizität wurde hauptsächlich durch direkte Berühung mit dem Mittel verursacht, jedoch nahm bei Ausbringung in Dampf‐Form die toxische Wirkung ab. Die Jungtiere zeigten größere Empfindlichkeit als die Adulten. Das Unkrautbekämp‐fungsmittel beeinflußte weiterhin die Mobilität der Springschwänze. Bei hoher Dosis (0,025 ml/dm2) kam es zu einer Abnahme der Mobilität, bei geringer Dosis (0,003 ml/ dm2) zu einer Zunahme. Außerdem zeigte das Herbizid eine abschreckende Wirkung auf die Springschwänze. Dennoch starben die meisten Versuchstiere, weil es ihnen nicht gelang, den vergifteten Stellen zu entrinnen. Die Herbizid‐akkumulationen, die in der Praxis in Waldböden gefunden wurden, wechselten wie in den Laborversuchen zwischen 0,0005 und 0,017 ml/dm2. Deshalb ist es sehr wahrscheinlich, daß bei der Verwendung des Unkraut‐bekämpfungsmittels 2,4,5‐T in unseren Böden ebenfalls schädliche Nebenwirkungen auf‐treten. 1978 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",1978,86,349,372,10.1111/j.1439-0418.1978.tb01942.x,YES,NO,NO,BEHAVIOUR,survival style analysis

The organisms are exposed both to the fungicide active ingredients and to the adjuvants of commercial formulations. All these ingredients are brought to the hive by bee foragers through contaminated pollen and nectar, thus exposing also immature individuals during larval phase. This work aimed to compare the effects of larval exposure to the fungicide pyraclostrobin (active ingredient and commercial formulation) and its influence on the cytotoxicity to midguts in adults, which were inoculated with the Nosema ceranae spores in the post-emergence stage. Under laboratory conditions, Apis mellifera larvae received an artificial diet containing fungicide solution from the third to the sixth day of the feeding phase. One-day-old adult workers ingested 100,000 infectious N. ceranae spores mixed in sucrose solution. Effects on midgut were evaluated through cellular biomarkers of stress and cell death. The exposure to the fungicide (active ingredient and commercial formulation) did not affect the larval post-embryonic development and survival of adult bees. However, this exposure induced cytotoxicity in the cells of the midgut, showed by the increase in DNA fragmentation and alteration in the HSP70 immunolabeling pattern. Without the pathogen, the midgut cytotoxic effects and HSP70 immunolabeling of the organisms exposed to the commercial formulation were lower when compared to the exposure to its active ingredient. However, in the presence of the pathogen, the cytotoxic effects of the commercial formulation to the adult bees' midgut were potentialized. The pathogen N. ceranae increased the damage to the intestinal epithelium of adult bees. Thus, realistic doses of pyraclostrobin present in beebread consumed by larvae can affect the health and induce physiological implications to the midgut functions of the adult bees.

Technical pesticides formulations, however, are mixtures with adjuvants as applied to fields/crops. Two formulations of the same pesticide can differ in their environmental fate and their toxicity. This work presents the evaluation of the toxicity of the dinitroaniline herbicide, pendimethalin by simultaneous analysis of its respiration rate and generation of a membrane potential (Δ ψ) in rat liver mitochondria. Chromatography grade pendimethalin (8.2.10 -5 - 5.47.10 -4 M or 23 - 154 ppm) caused lower enhancement of the mitochondrial respiration and decrease of the Δ ψ than technical grade pendimethalin (Stomp), i.e. the mixture of pure ingredient and adjuvant(s). These effects are comparable to those of 2,4-dinitrophenol. Pure and technical grade pendimethalin acts as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (enhances respiration and diminishes Δ ψ).

In the present study, sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction and cell cycle kinetics alterations by 2,4-D in 4-day old chick embryos were evaluated. Both a commercial herbicide formulation containing 37% 2,4-D isooctyl ester as active ingredient and pure 2,4-D were tested. Chick embryos were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg 2,4-D.

Significantly higher SCE frequency was seen for the 4-mg group of embryos treated with the commercial product. A slightly higher SCE value was observed for the vehicle group (acetone-treated embryos) compared with the negative controls (untreated embryos). Significant inhibition of cell cycle progression was evident in both experimental groups and was generally dose related.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations. In summary, combining an active ingredient with a custom synergist appears to be a very promising approach for the development of effective new insecticide products.",2016,64,5148,5155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01512,YES,YES,NO,n/a,this is investigating a synergist so I don't think this should be included.

Adverse effects were analyzed by means of the isotoxicity curves for lethality, malformations, stage-dependent susceptibility, and ultrastructural features. For all experimental conditions, the CF was more toxic, up to 10 times, than the active ingredient, being the open mouth stage (S. 21) the most susceptible to the herbicide. For continuous treatment conditions, the early embryonic development was the most susceptible to 2,4-D and the LC50s for 96 and 168 h were 9.06 and 7.76 mg L(-1) respectively. In addition, both the active ingredient and the CF were highly teratogenic, resulting in reduced body size, delayed development, microcephaly, agenesis of gills, and abnormal cellular proliferation processes as the main adverse effects. According to US EPA, 2,4-D in agricultural scenarios may be up to three times higher than the NOEC values for teratogenic effects reported in this study.

(active ingredient) of the pyrethroid insecticide ‘Cymbush’® containing cypermethrin, or, the equivalent dilution of a blank formulation without the a.i. With broad beans, similar growth stimulation was obtained with the blank at the same or half dose, but not at a quarter dose. Testing the four formulation components separately showed that only the non-ionic emulsifier caused stimulation. A comparison of the stimulation of plant growth by the blank and the non-ionic emulsifier showed that plant height, shoot fresh weight, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight and leaf area were each equally increased by both treatments. The non-ionic emulsifier thus accounted for the entire stimulation caused by blank solution. Populations of Aphis fabae Scopoli (Homoptera: Aphididae) were twice as high on broad bean plants sprayed with the non-ionic emulsifier as on the controls. ‘Cymbush’ (the complete formulation) sprayed at 25 ppm a.i. was shown to increase the intrinsic rate of natural increase of the aphid through a 22% increase in fecundity; aphid development time was not affected. The results do, however, suggest that residual effects of cypermethrin may have partly counteracted the stimulatory effects of the non-ionic emulsifier. Nevertheless, it is possible that outbreaks of aphids and mites following pyrethroid application, and often assumed without evidence to have been due to natural enemy mortality, may at least in part reflect the plant stimulation caused by the non-ionic emulsifier in the formulation. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

One reason for the failing risk assessment may be strong differences in the toxicity of the active ingredient of pesticides and their commercial formulations. Sublethal effects, especially those on behaviour, have been largely ignored in this context, yet can be equally important as lethal effects at the population and ecosystem levels. Here, we compared the toxicity of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on survival, but also on ecologically relevant sublethal traits (life history, behaviour and physiology) in damselfly larvae. Roundup was more toxic than glyphosate with negative effects on survival, behaviour and most of the physiological traits being present at lower concentrations (food intake, escape swimming speed) or even only present (survival, sugar and total energy content and muscle mass) following Roundup exposure. This confirms the toxicity of the surfactant POEA. Notably, also glyphosate was not harmless: a realistic concentration of 2 mg/l resulted in reduced growth rate, escape swimming speed and fat content. Our results therefore indicate that the toxicity of Roundup cannot be fully attributed to its surfactant, thereby suggesting that also the new generation of glyphosate-based herbicides with other mixtures of surfactants likely will have adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological studies comparing the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations typically ignore behaviour while the here observed differential effects on behaviour likely will negatively impact damselfly populations.

Commercial insecticide formulations, however, contain a significant proportion (>90%) of so-called inert ingredients, which may alter the toxicity of the active ingredient(s). This study compares the sublethal toxicity of two insecticides, the pyrethroid bifenthrin, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil, to their commercial formulations, Talstar (R) and Termidor (R). Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff.

Also, to separate the effects of the inert and two active ingredients, bees were fed pollen containing boscalid, pyraclostrobin, or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid, at concentrations matching those in the Pristine (R) treatments. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced pollen consumption across the duration of the experiment, and dose dependently reduced pollen consumption on days 12-14. Pristine (R) and boscalid significantly reduced pollen feeding rate on days 12-14. Boscalid reduced survival in a dose-dependent manner. Consumption of Pristine (R) or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid did not affect survival, providing evidence against strong negative effects of the inert ingredients in Pristine (R) and against negative synergistic effects of boscalid and pyraclostrobin. The stronger toxic effects of Pristine (R) observed in field colonies compared to this laboratory test, and the opposite responses of pollen consumption in the laboratory and field to Pristine (R), show that standard laboratory toxicology tests can fail to predict responses of pollinators to pesticides and to provide protection.",2021,226,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112841,YES,NO,YES,n/a,tested many concentrations but range was very small.

The 2,4-D (salt) was shown to be less toxic to C. vernalis than reported toxicity for Lepomis macrochirus. 3) The toxicity of the commercial formulations was not dependent on the active ingredient content. Amitrole-T with 20 percent active ingredient proved to be more toxic than reagent grade amitrole. The alkanolamine salt of 2,4-D was less toxic than 2,4-D (free acid) to an extent much greater than could be expected from the examination of the acid equivalent of 2,4-D (salt). 4) Each of the herbicides examined apparently exhibited more than one mode of toxic action. This was demonstrated by the time-mortality data. 5) The method used here would be useful in the determination of effects other than mortality such as instar lengths, rates of molting and susceptability of different naupliar stages to stress factors. © 1976 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",1976,16,682,688,10.1007/BF01685573,YES,YES,NO,DEVELOPMENT,n/a

This study investigates the in vitro effect in human spermatozoa of Roundup Ultra Plus (RUP), its active ingredient glyphosate and its non-active, surfactant. Human spermatozoa were incubated (1 h, 37 degrees C) in presence/absence of RUP 0.01%, glyphosate, or equivalent surfactant concentration. Motility and sperm parameters were analyzed by C.A.S.A and flow cytometry, respectively. RUP significantly increases sperm plasma membrane lipid disorganization in a concentration-dependent manner while it decreases plasma membrane integrity. RUP significantly increases the death spermatozoa population after A23187-induced acrosome reaction, without affecting sperm viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS content, acrosome membrane damage, phosphatidylserine exposure, A23187-induced acrosome reaction or GSK3 phosphorylation. RUP also significantly decreases motile and the a + b sperm populations. Interestingly, all sperm effects caused by RUP 0.01% are mimicked by its surfactant POEA at equivalent concentration. However, glyphosate does not affect any sperm parameter, even using 10-times higher concentration than the RUP 0.01% equivalent. RUP disturbs lipid organization and integrity of human sperm plasma membrane and reduces motility, without affecting viability or functional parameters.

Several reports and reviews report cardiovascular effects of Roundup (R), pointing the presence of arrhythmias as a potential consequence of Roundup (R) toxicity and death cause. However, it still remains debatable whether these cardiac events are related to glyphosate per se or to the Roundup (R) adjuvants. The present study aims to compare the pro-arrhythmogenic properties of Roundup (R) and glyphosate in an animal model and in human cardiomyocytes. In isolated guinea pig heart, the cardiotoxicity of Roundup (R) (significant effect on heart rate and depressive effect on ventricular contractility) was demonstrated with the highest concentrations (100 mu M). In human cardiomyocytes, the cardiotoxicity is confirmed by a marked effect on contractility and a strong effect on cell viability. Finally, this Roundup (R) depressive effect on heart contractility is due to a concentration-dependent blocking effect on cardiac calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 with an IC50 value of 3.76 mu M. Surprisingly, no significant effect on each parameter has been shown with glyphosate. Glyphosate was devoid of major effect on cardiac calcium channel with a maximal effect at 100 mu M (- 27.2 +1.7%, p < 0.01). In conclusion, Roundup (R) could induce severe cardiac toxicity by a blockade of Ca(v)1.2 channel, leading to a worsening of heart contractility and genesis of arrhythmias.

Log-phase cells were treated with 1.0-500.0 μg/ml of the herbicides and harvested 24 h later for SCE and cell-cycle progression analyses. All concentrations assessed of both test compounds induced higher SCE frequencies over control values. SCEs increased in a non-dose-dependent manner neither for the pure compound (r = 0.48; P > 0.05) nor for the commercial formulation (r = 0.58, P > 0.05). For the 200.0 μg/ml and 500.0 μg/ml dicamba doses and the 500.0 μg/ml banvel® dose, a significant delay in the cell-cycle progression was found. A regression test showed that the proliferation rate index decreased as a function of either the concentration of dicamba (r = -0.98, P < 0.05) or banvel® (r = -0.88, P < 0.01) titrated into cultures in the 1.0-500.0 μg/ml dose-range. SCGE performed on CHO cells after a 90 min pulse-treatment of dicamba and banvel® within a 50.0-500.0 μg/ml dose-range revealed a clear increase in dicamba-induced DNA damage as an enhancement of the proportion of slightly damaged and damaged cells for all concentrations used (P < 0.01); concomitantly, a decrease of undamaged cells was found over control values (P < 0.01). In banvel®-treated cells, a similar overall result was registered.

Both commercially formulated and purified azadirachtin were used in the experiments. The results of adult feeding experiments showed that azadirachtin significantly reduced syrup consumption by worker bees (P < 0.05) and exhibited a dose response in mortality: with an oral LC50 of 10.87 <mu>g/ml in mite-free bees, 13.69 mug/ml in mite-infested bees, and 41.87 mug/ml for associated mites.

Due to its widespread use around the world, relatively high concentrations of glyphosate have been detected in soil and aquatic environments. The presence of glyphosate in aquatic ecosystems has aroused the attention of researchers because of its potential negative effects on living organisms, both animals and plants. In this context, this review intends to summarize results of studies aimed at evaluating the effects of glyphosate (both as active ingredient and component of commercial formulations) on marine invertebrates. Generally, data obtained in acute toxicity tests indicate that glyphosate and its commercial formulations are lethal at high concentrations (not environmentally realistic), whereas results of long-lasting experiments indicate that glyphosate can markedly affect biological responses of marine invertebrates. Consequently, more efforts should be addressed at evaluating chronic or sub-chronic effects of such substances to marine invertebrate species. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,8,,,10.3390/JMSE8060399,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,review

Methods: The effects of validamycin pesticide ingredients on cell viability and of NP40 on the mRNA expression of 80 genes involved in nine key cellular pathways were examined in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Results: The chemicals present in the validamycin pesticide formulation were cytotoxic to SK-N-SH cells and NP40 showed the greatest cytotoxicity. A range of gene expression changes were identified, with both up-and down-regulation of genes within the same pathway. However, all genes tested in the necrosis signaling pathway were down-regulated and all genes tested in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway were up-regulated. The median fold-change in gene expression was significantly higher in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway than in the hypoxia pathway category (p = 0.0064).

Three related herbicide formulations were chosen. The first, Agent Orange, consisted only of the butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. The second was Agent Orange diluted with diesel fuel and the third formulation tested was a tree and blackberry killer, which consisted of the butyl ester of 2,4,5-T, the ethyl ester of 2,4-D, diesel fuel and two surfactants. The potential toxic effects of these three formulations were evaluated by determining their inhibitory effects on the oxidative functions of submitochondrial particles prepared from beef heart mitochondria. The effective concentration that caused a 50% inhibition of the activities of the submitochondrial particles was determined for all three formulations. When the toxicity of the individual components of these formulations was evaluated, it was established that the so-called 'inert' components i.e. diesel fuel and surfactants contributed approximately 50% of the overall toxicity of the complete formulations. Hence the results confirm the importance of evaluating the toxicity of complete formulations, rather than only focussing on the active components.

scopus3456,Guy,YES,Meredith A.N.; Harper B.; Harper S.L.,the influence of size on the toxicity of an encapsulated pesticide: a comparison of micron  and nano sized capsules,Environment International,"Encapsulation technology involves entrapping a chemical active ingredient (a.i.) inside a hollow polymeric shell and has been applied to commercial pesticide manufacturing for years to produce capsule suspension (CS) formulations with average particle sizes in the micron-scale. The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50μm. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2μm with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (~200nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (~250nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (~2200nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20μg a.i. L-1 technical λ-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016,86,68,74,10.1016/j.envint.2015.10.012,YES,NO,YES,DEVELOPMENT,No CIs reported.

The massive and increasing use of GBHs results in not only the global burden of occupational exposures, but also increased exposure to the general population. The current pilot study represents the first phase of a long-term investigation of GBHs that we are conducting over the next 5 years. In this paper, we present the study design, the first evaluation of in vivo parameters and the determination of glyphosate and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in urine. Methods: We exposed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats orally via drinking water to a dose of glyphosate equivalent to the United States Acceptable Daily Intake (US ADI) of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, defined as the chronic Reference Dose (cRfD) determined by the US EPA, starting from prenatal life, i.e. gestational day (GD) 6 of their mothers. One cohort was continuously dosed until sexual maturity (6-week cohort) and another cohort was continuously dosed until adulthood (13-week cohort). Here we present data on general toxicity and urinary concentrations of glyphosate and its major metabolite AMPA. Results: Survival, body weight, food and water consumption of the animals were not affected by the treatment with either glyphosate or Roundup. The concentration of both glyphosate and AMPA detected in the urine of SD rats treated with glyphosate were comparable to that observed in animals treated with Roundup, with an increase in relation to the duration of treatment. The majority of glyphosate was excreted unchanged. Urinary levels of the parent compound, glyphosate, were around 100-fold higher than the level of its metabolite, AMPA. Conclusions: Glyphosate concentrations in urine showed that most part of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged parent compound upon glyphosate and Roundup exposure, with an increasing pattern of glyphosate excreted in urine in relation to the duration of treatment The adjuvants and the other substances present in Roundup did not seem to exert a major effect on the absorption and excretion of glyphosate. Our results demonstrate that urinary glyphosate is a more relevant marker of exposure than AMPA in the rodent model.",2018,17,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-018-0393-y,YES,NO,NO,GROWTH/BEHAVIOUR,survival style analysis

The acute and chronic toxicity of a commercial formulation containing 250 g L-1 of difenoconazole (Prisma (R)) as the active ingredient was assessed in the freshwater planarian Girardia tigrina. The endpoints evaluated were feeding rate, locomotion, regeneration, and sexual reproduction of planarians. The estimated 48 h LC50 of the commercial formulation on planarians expressed as the concentration of the active ingredient difenoconazole was 47.5 mg a.i.L-1. A significant decrease of locomotion (LOEC = 18.56 mg a.i.L-1), delayed regeneration (LOEC = 9.28 mg a.i.L-1), and sexual reproduction impairment, i.e., decreased fecundity and fertility rates (LOEC <= 1.16 mg a.i.L-1) were observed on planarians exposed to sublethal concentrations of the formulation. This study demonstrated the importance of using reproductive, physiological, and behavioral parameters as more sensitive and complementary tools to assess the deleterious effects induced by a commercial formulation of difenoconazole on a nontarget freshwater organism. The added value and importance of our research work, namely, the impairment of sexual reproduction of planarians, contributes to the development of useful tools for ecotoxicology and highlights the fact that those tools should be developed as guidelines for testing of chemicals.

We identified the most commonly used POEA, known as POE-15 tallow amine (POE-15), in the widely used US GBH RangerPro. Cytotoxicity assays using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 and hepatocyte HepG2 cell lines showed that RangerPro and POE-15 are far more cytotoxic than glyphosate alone. RangerPro and POE-15 but not glyphosate caused cell necrosis in both cell lines, and that glyphosate and RangerPro but not POE-15 caused oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. We further tested these pesticide ingredients in the ToxTracker assay, a system used to evaluate a compound's carcinogenic potential, to assess their capability for inducing DNA damage, oxidative stress and an unfolded protein response (endoplasmic reticulum, ER stress). RangerPro and POE-15 but not glyphosate gave rise to ER stress. We conclude that the toxicity resulting from RangerPro exposure is thus multifactorial involving ER stress caused by POE-15 along with oxidative stress caused by glyphosate.

Acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP (15 μg/mL) and POEA (45 μg/mL) reduced (p < 0.001) lifespan of female flies compared to untreated controls or glyphosate (100 μg/mL). Negative geotaxis responses in female flies were reduced (p < 0.05) following acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA whereas glyphosate did not significantly affect this response compared to untreated flies. Acute exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA elevated (p < 0.05) protein carbonyl levels while markedly (p < 0.01) inhibiting carbonyl reductase activity whereas glyphosate treatment did not significantly affect protein carbonyl levels or carbonyl reductase activity. Fecundity was reduced (p < 0.05) following exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA whereas glyphosate did not affect fecundity. In vitro treatment of ovarian stem sheath (OSS) cells with sub-lethal concentrations of RCP and POEA revealed decreased cell viability and enhanced caspase activity indicative of pro-apoptotic processes after 48 h compared to untreated controls. Glyphosate however was non-toxic at the concentration used. The results suggest that RCP and the surfactant POEA are more toxic than pure glyphosate and inhibit fecundity in Drosophila by impairing cell viability through enhanced apoptosis. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020,188,,,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109883,YES,YES,NO,FECUNDITY,n/a

Its range of sensitivity to potassium dichromate, the acute toxicity of active ingredient carbofuran and of carbofuran dosed as its commercial form, Furadan (R) 350 SC were determined. Chronic toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC on P. roseola survival and fecundity were also studied. The sensitivity of P. roseola to K2Cr2O7 ranged from 29.52 to 64.67 mg L-1, averaging 47.10 mg L-1. The 48-h EC50 were 13.36 +/- 2.63 mg L-1 for carbofuran and 89.32 +/- 6.52 mg L-1 for commercial form. Chronic toxicity tests showed that the survival of this rotifer was not affected by the carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC at the concentrations tested and that at 1.56 and 3.12 mg L-1 their fecundity was higher than in the absence of this commercial product, characterizing the hormesis phenomenon. The sensitivity profile of several species to carbofuran indicated that P. roseola is more susceptible to this pesticide than the fish Clarias batrachus, the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the protozoan Paramecium caudatum and the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, although the acute toxicity of carbofuran dosed as Furadan (R) 350 SC to P. roseola is much lower than that of active ingredient carbofuran. The results also imply that the exacerbated use of pesticides and the constant, accelerated expansion of agricultural activity will make aquatic non-target species even more vulnerable.

Despite a number of recent studies examining the effects of glyphosate on amphibians, very few have aimed to understand the toxicological effects of glyphosate in combination with surfactants as it is commonly applied in the field. Land managers interested in making pesticide choices based on minimizing impacts to nontarget wildlife are hindered by a lack of published toxicity data. Short-term acute toxicity trials were conducted for glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt (IPA) alone and mixed with 2 surfactants: Agri-dex and Competitor with western toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] boreas) tadpoles. Glyphosate IPA mixed with Competitor was 6 times more toxic than glyphosate IPA mixed with Agri-dex, and both mixtures were more toxic than glyphosate IPA alone. The median lethal concentrations reported for 24-h and 48-h exposures were 8279mg/L (24h) and 6392mg/L (48h) for glyphosate IPA alone; 5092mg/L (24h) and 4254mg/L (48h) for glyphosate IPA mixed with Agri-dex; and 853mg/L (24h) and 711mg/L (48h) for glyphosate IPA mixed with Competitor.

We have tested the toxicity and endocrine disruption potential of Roundup (Bioforce (R)) on human embryonic 293 and placental-derived JEG3 cells, but also on normal human placenta and equine testis. The cell lines have proven to be suitable to estimate hormonal activity and toxicity of pollutants. The median lethal dose (LD50) Of Roundup with embryonic cells is 0.3% within 1 h in serum-free medium, and it decreases to reach 0.06% (containing among other compounds 1.27 mM glyphosate) after 72 h in the presence of serum. In these conditions, the embryonic cells appear to be 2-4 times more sensitive than the placental ones. In all instances, Roundup (generally used in agriculture at 1-2%, i.e., with 21-42 mM glyphosate) is more efficient than its active ingredient, glyphosate, suggesting a synergistic effect provoked by the adjuvants present in Roundup. We demonstrated that serum-free cultures, even on a short-term basis (1 h), reveal the xenobiotic impacts that are visible 1-2 days later in serum. We also document at lower non-overtly toxic doses, from 0.01% (with 210 mu M glyphosate) in 24 h, that Roundup is an aromatase disruptor. The direct inhibition is temperature-dependent and is confirmed in different tissues and species (cell lines from placenta or embryonic kidney, equine testicular, or human fresh placental extracts). Furthermore, glyphosate acts directly as a partial inactivator on microsomal aromatase, independently of its acidity, and in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxic, and potentially endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup are thus amplified with time. Taken together, these data suggest that Roundup exposure may affect human reproduction and fetal development in case of contamination.

Invertebrate 48-h EC50’s (concentration immobilizing 50% of the test organisms) or LC50’s (concentration lethal to 50% of the test organisms) ranged from 2.4 μg/liter for amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) to 3, 200 μg/liter for larval midges (Chironomus plumosus).

Nevertheless, they have been reported to affect several non-target organisms. Most toxicity studies focus on the effects on pollinators or terrestrial invertebrates and evaluate either the active ingredient or the commercial formulation. In the present study, we aimed to assess the long-term effects of the active ingredient acetamiprid and a broadly used commercial formulation (Assail (R) 70) on the non-target freshwater gastropod Biomphalaria straminea using a battery of biomarkers. A 14 day-exposure of adult organisms to both active ingredient and commercial formulation increased carboxylesterase activity and glutathione content, inhibited superoxide dismutase activity and decreased reactive oxygen species levels. The commercial formulation additionally increased glutathione S-transferase activity and inhibited catalase activity. The results indicate a greater toxicity of the commercial formulation than that of the active ingredient alone. Cholinesterase activity, development and offspring survival of B. straminea were not impaired. We conclude that the toxicity of acetamiprid on this gastropod species is mainly related to effects on detoxification and oxidative metabolism responses.

For E. andrei, formulations and pure compounds had similar toxicity to both endpoints tested. For F. candida, acetamiprid and imidacloprid had different toxicities, with acetamiprid being 4 times more toxic to survival (median lethal concentration [LC50] 0.12 mg active substance [a.s.]/kg dry soil) and imidacloprid being 4 times more toxic to reproduction of the springtail (median effect concentration [EC50] 0.25 mg a.s./kg dry soil) than their commercial formulations.

Toxicity studies have been performed for each herbicide individually, but there is a dearth of information concerning the toxicity of these herbicides in a mixture. The following study examined the toxicity of a mixture of these two herbicides in the red swamp crawfish, Procambarus clarkii. 96-hour acute toxicity assays were performed to determine whether surfactant significantly altered the toxicity of these herbicides individually or in combination. Markings additive index was calculated to identify the interactions of the herbicide mixture. Surfactant was observed to significantly increase the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the toxicity of the herbicide mixture. The herbicide mixture alone displayed half the toxicity of the individual herbicides, but the mixture with surfactant was twice as toxic as the individual herbicides. The synergistic action of surfactant may be attributed to increased pesticide absorption across biological membranes. 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and surfactant may also compromise gill function, increasing the sensitivity of the crawfish to herbicide toxicity. The antagonistic effects of the herbicide mixture in the absence of surfactant may be caused by competition of both herbicides for the same sites of activity.",2004,1,35,38,10.3390/ijerph2004010035,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Similar tests with ringed turtledoves (Streptopelia risoria) were conducted with five of the granular formulations to check for interspecific differences. The test chemicals were Amaze 15G (isofenphos), Counter 15G (terbufos), Dasanit 15G (fensulfothion), Diazinon 14G (diazinon), Di-Syston 15G (disulfoton), Dyfonate 20G (fonofos), Furadan 10G (carbofuran), Lorsban 15G (chlorpyrifos), Nemacur 15G (fenamiphos), Parathion 10G (parathion), Tattoo 10G (bendiocarb), Temik 15G (aldicarb), and Thimet 15G (phorate). Information is also presented on dose-response relations and their use in hazard assessment, granule size and hazard, response patterns, and toxic signs. The general conclusions were: (1) The organophosphates (fenamiphos and fensulfothion) and the carbamate (aldicarb) were the most toxic of the insecticides tested. (2) The granular formulation and its technical grade active ingredient were of equivalent toxicity, or the granular was significantly less toxic. (3) The dose-response curve enhances hazard assessment. (4) Ingestion of a single granule of Temik 15G was shown to be life threatening to bobwhite-sized birds, and ingestion of fewer than five granules could be lethal to sparrow-sized birds for Dasanit 15G, Diazinon 14G, Dyfonate 20G, Furadan 15G, and Nemacur 15G.

The first commercial product of the neem tree, Margosan-O (W.R. Grace), was registered in the U.S. in 1985. Since then several other neem-based insecticides have been approved for use as pest controls. Pesticides, especially those interfering with animals' metabolism, in agricultural run-off water might have a detrimental effect on aquatic crustaceans, mollusks, or fish. The effect of AZA on crustaceans may be similar to the effects on insects since both are classified under the same phylum, arthropoda, and both have the same growth and molting hormones. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of neem-based pesticide (Neemix(TM)) on selected crustaceans (crayfish, blue crab, and water fleas) and a mollusk species (freshwater snails) which are important in the food chain. LC(50)s for water fleas were found to be 0.246 ppm and 0.024 ppm AZA for pure AZA and Neemix(TM), respectively. The LC50 value for Neemix(TM) was 6.60 ppm AZA for crayfish. AZA did not show significant toxicity to crayfish at the concentrations used. For freshwater snails, the LC50 for Neemix(TM) was 2.45 ppm AZA while that of pure AZA was >30 ppm. The LC50 value for blue crabs was 1.16 ppm AZA for Neemix(TM). These results showed that Neemix(TM) was more toxic than pure AZA when applied at equivalent AZA concentrations, indicating that AZA is not the only active compound in Neemix(TM).",1998,NA,1248,1253,NA,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,biopesticide

Different formulations using the same active ingredient are frequently available, which raises the issue of potential influence of different formulation types on herbicide toxicity. The present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampe (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the way of active substance release. This investigation is the first report on zebrafish embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The technical active ingredient and formulations caused mortality and diverse teratogenic effects, showing different levels of toxicity.

To understand their mode of action, the comparative herbicidal and toxicological effects of glyphosate (G) alone and 14 of its formulations were studied in this work, as a model for pesticides. GBH are mixtures of water, with commonly 36-48% G claimed as the active principle. As with other pesticides, 10-20% of GBH consist of chemical formulants. We previously identified these by mass spectrometry and found them to be mainly families of petroleum-based oxidized molecules, such as POEA, and other contaminants. We exposed plants and human cells to the components of formulations, both mixed and separately, and measured toxicity and human cellular endocrine disruption below the direct toxicity experimentally measured threshold. G was only slightly toxic on plants at the recommended dilutions in agriculture, in contrast with the general belief. In the short term, the strong herbicidal and toxic properties of its formulations were exerted by the POEA formulant family alone. The toxic effects and endocrine disrupting properties of the formulations were mostly due to the formulants and not to G. In this work, we also identified by mass spectrometry the heavy metals arsenic, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel, which are known to be toxic and endocrine disruptors, as contaminants in 22 pesticides, including 11 G-based ones. This could also explain some of the adverse effects of the pesticides. In in vivo chronic regulatory experiments that are used to establish the acceptable daily intakes of pesticides, G or other declared active ingredients in pesticides are assessed alone, without the formulants.

Risk assessments are usually based on the pure active ingredient and not on the formulated products applied in the environment. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how azoxystrobin, the best-selling strobilurin fungicide, affects non-target soil organisms Enchytraeus albidus. To investigate the effects of the different types of azoxystrobin, E. albidus was exposed to the pure active ingredient, AZO_AI, and the formulated product, AZO_FP. Survival, reproduction, and molecular biomarkers of E. albidus were determined for different exposure durations (seven and 21 days). AZO_FP (LC50 = 15.3 mg(a.i.)/kg) showed a slightly stronger effect on survival than AZO_AI (LC50 = 16.8 mg(a.i.)/kg), yet the impact on reproduction was much stronger. Namely, while the tested concentrations of AZO_AI (EC50 >= 8 mg(a.i.)/kg) had almost no effect on reproduction, AZO_FP (EC50 = 2.9 mg(a.i.)/kg) significantly inhibited reproduction in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase) and malondialdehyde levels in both treatments indicated oxidative stress. Although AZO_FP had a stronger negative effect, the impact depended on the exposure time and the tested concentration. The higher toxicity of AZO_FP was a consequence of increased bioavailability and activity of the active ingredient due to the presence of adjuvants. Overall stronger adverse effects of AZO_FP suggest that the toxicity of azoxystrobin in the agricultural environment on the enchytraeid population may be underestimated.

In a 96-h acute toxicity test we exposed Rana dalmatina and Bufo bufo tadpoles to either one of three concentrations of glyphosate, three concentrations of the surfactant (POEA), three concentrations of the two components together, or to non-contaminated water (control), and subsequently assessed mortality and body mass. To investigate whether simultaneous exposure to another stress factor influences effects of the contaminants, we performed tests both in the presence or absence of predator chemical cues. We found that the surfactant had significant harmful effects on tadpoles; survival was lowered by the highest concentration of the surfactant in case of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo tadpoles it reduced survival already at medium concentrations. Body mass was significantly influenced by medium and high surfactant concentrations in both species. The presence of glyphosate did not have a significant effect by itself, but it slightly increased mortality in tadpoles exposed to medium concentrations of the surfactant in both species. The presence of chemical cues did not have an effect on the examined variables. Our study confirms that the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides is mainly due to the examined surfactant. Nonetheless, we found that glyphosate can enhance the harmful effect of the surfactant.

Fenvalerate and esfenvalerate were both highly toxic to larval rainbow fish with 1-h esfenvalerate pulse-exposure concentrations as low as 0.32 μg l-1, and 1-min fenvalerate pulse-exposure concentrations of 4.5 μg l-1, sufficient to cause significant mortality. Technical grades were significantly more toxic than emulsified grades of the pesticides. The 1-h pulse-exposure 96-h LC50's were 12.75, 30.25, 1.18, and 1.99 μg l-1 for technical fenvalerate, emulsified fenvalerate, technical esfenvalerate, and emulsified esfenvalerate, respectively. Emulsified fenvalerate and esfenvalerate were also extremely toxic to adult crimson-spotted rainbow fish. The 96-h continuous exposure LC50's for adult fish using 50% daily partial replacement were 14.58 and 6.24 μg l-1, respectively, comparable with results for holarctic species. Fenvalerate is a racemic mixture containing four optical isomers (2R, aR; 2R, aS; 2S, aR, 2S, aS), while esfenvalerate contains mainly the 2S isomers. Esfenvalerate contains approximately twice the quantity of 2S isomers as does fenvalerate on a weight basis. Pulse-exposure LC50's for esfenvalerate were 10 to 15 times lower than for fenvalerate, a much higher toxicity of esfenvalerate than the roughly two fold difference which would have been predicted solely on a weight basis. Thus the 2R isomers, which make up approximately 50% of the fenvalerate formulation and which previously were regarded as non-active, appear to have reduced the expected toxicity of fenvalerate relative to measured esfenvalerate toxicity, perhaps via the inhibition of sodium channel activation. There was a complex relationship between pesticide concentration and time to mortality. At low concentrations of pesticide, most mortality occurred within the first 24 h, while at higher concentrations, mortality continued for 96 h after exposure. This suggests that mortality within the first 24 h was due to direct physiological effects of the pesticide on the larvae, while subsequent mortality was primarily due to starvation of larvae unable to recover from the initial insult. Duration of exposure (0 to 120 min) to emulsified fenvalerate and esfenvalerate significantly affected the acute toxicity to larval rainbow fish. For esfenvalerate, there was a linear relationship between duration of exposure and acute toxicity, while for fenvalerate, exposures of longer than 20 min did not significantly increase 96-h mortality. © 1994.",1994,28,169,187,10.1016/0166-445X(94)90032-9,YES,YES,NO,n/a,n/a

Acute toxicities for Roundup ranged from 2.3 mg/L (96-h LC50, fathead minnow) to 43 mg/L (48-h EC50, mature scuds). Toxicities of the surfactant were similar to those of the Roundup formulation. Technical glyphosate was considerably less toxic than Roundup or the surfactant; for midge larvae, the 48-h EC50 was 55 mg/L and for rainbow trout, the 96-h LC50 was 140 mg/L. Roundup was more toxic to rainbow trout and bluegills at the higher test temperatures, and at pH 7.5 than at pH 6.5. Toxicity did not increase at pH 8.5 or 9.5. Eyed eggs were the least sensitive life stage, but toxicity increased markedly as the fish entered the sac fry and early swim-up stages. No changes in fecundity or gonadosomatic index were observed in adult rainbow trout treated with the isopropylamine salt or Roundup up to 2.0 mg/L. The aging of Roundup test solutions for seven days did not reduce toxicity to midge larvae, rainbow trout or bluegills. In avoidance studies, rainbow trout did not avoid concentrations of the isopropylamine salt up to 10.0 mg/L; mayfly nymphs avoided 10.0 mg/L of Roundup, but not 1.0 mg/L. In a simulated field application, midge larvae avoided 2.0 mg/L of Roundup. Application of Roundup, at recommended rates, along ditchbank areas of irrigation canals should not adversely affect resident populations of fish or invertebrates. However, spring applications in lentic situations, where dissolved oxygen levels are low or temperatures are elevated, could be hazardous to young-of-the-year-fishes. © 1979 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",1979,8,269,278,10.1007/BF01056243,YES,YES,NO,FECUNDITY,n/a

The objective of this study was to compare the sorption/desorption, biodegradation and toxic effects of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulation (Ectomort Centenary) of the organophosphate insecticide propetamphos in river and estuarine sediments. For both formulations, the sorption of propetamphos onto sediment was initially very rapid followed by a slower sorption phase. Similarly, the initial rate of desorption was rapid, followed by a much slower rate. In both sorption and desorption experiments, the level of sorbed propetamphos was considerably higher for the commercial formulation of propetamphos (K-d = 7-11) than for the Pestanal (R) grade (K-d = 4-10). The rate of propetamphos biodegradation was sediment dependent but was most rapid where microbial activity and nutrients were the highest and sorption was the lowest. Propetamphos was more rapidly degraded in sediments under aerobic (t(1/2)=15 d) compared to anaerobic conditions (t(1/2) = 19 d). However, no significant difference in the biodegradation rates of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulations of propetamphos were observed. The toxic effect of propetamphos on sediment microbial communities was significantly greater for the commercial formulation than for the Pestanal (R) grade of propetamphos based on EC50 (21 versus 236 mu g g(-1)) and EC10 values (0.3 versus 54 mu g g(-1)).

The lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata is an important beneficial insect in cropland that is commonly used as an indicator species in safety evaluations of pesticides. Here, we examined the lethal and non-lethal effects of 2,4-D and dicamba active ingredients and commercial formulations to this lady beetle species, and tested for synergistic effects of the herbicides. Second instars of lady beetles were exposed to an experimental treatment, and their mortality, development, weight, sex ratio, fecundity, and mobility was evaluated. Using similar methods, a dose-response study was conducted on 2,4-D with and without dicamba. The commercial formulation of 2,4-D was highly lethal to lady beetle larvae; the LC90 of this herbicide was 13 % of the label rate. In this case, the inactive ingredients were a key driver of the toxicity. Dicamba active ingredient significantly increased lady beetle mortality and reduced their body weight. The commercial formulations of both herbicides reduced the proportion of males in the lady beetle population. The herbicides when used together did not act synergistically in their toxicity toward lady beetles versus when the chemistries were used independently. Our work shows that herbicide formulations can cause both lethal and sublethal effects on non-target, beneficial insects, and these effects are sometimes driven by the inactive ingredients. The field-level implications of shifts in weed management practices on insect management programs should receive further attention.",2016,25,1270,1277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-016-1680-4,YES,NO,NO,GROWTH/REPRODUCTION/BEHAVIOUR,n/a

Yet little is known about ecotoxicological effects on non-target benthic freshwater species exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IMI and its marketed products. The aim of the present study was to narrow this gap by assessing effects of pure IMI and its commercial formulation Confidor (R) on the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, a key species in freshwater sediments. To this end, we determined dose-response relationships in 24 h toxicity tests, bioconcentration during 24 h and 5 d of exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g IMI L-1, and physiological stress responses by measuring glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase activity in the same conditions. Maximum neonicotinoid concentrations reported from the field were lethal to L. variegatus within 24 h (LC50 of 65 and 88 mu g IMI L-1 in pure form and as active ingredient of Confidor (R), respectively). At sub-lethal exposure concentrations, tissue content of IMI significantly increased with exposure time. The observed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were far above the water octanol coefficient (K-OW), indicating a potentially large underestimation of IMI bioaccumulation when based on K-OW. Activities of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes indicated attempts of L. variegatus to counter xenobiotic-triggered oxidative stress to very low IMI and Confidor (R) concentrations. Together, our data add significantly to growing evidence that the continued proliferation of neonicotinoids require increased efforts in environmental risk assessment, especially in view of species-specific differences in sensitivities to the insecticide and possibly to additives of commercial formulations.

One of the goals of the present study was to determine imidacloprid uptake and distribution in the freshwater fish Australoheros facetus experimentally exposed for 24 h and 48 h to 100mg/L, 300 mg/L, and 2500 mg/L. The toxicity of imidacloprid to fish reported in the literature is in the milligrams per liter or gram per liter range, but sublethal effects at micrograms per liter in some groups other than fish have been described. Another goal of the present study was to evaluate imidacloprid's potential genotoxicity and to compare it between the individual compound and a commercial formulation. Concentrations of imidacloprid were measured in water, brain, muscle, gills, gut, liver, and blood by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Imidacloprid was detected in all the tissues tested. Concentrations were higher after 48 h than after 24 h in liver, gills, gut, and muscle, whereas in brain and blood they were similar at both exposure times. Although there was no accumulation, only uptake, of imidacloprid, genotoxicity was observed. In fish exposed to IMIDA NOVA 35 1, increased micronucleus frequency at 100 mg/L and 1000mg/L was detected, whereas in the imidacloprid active ingredient bioassay it increased only at 1000 mg/L imidacloprid. The present findings warn of the possible consequences that fish living in freshwater ecosystems can suffer.

In order to better understand the toxicity results obtained in field conditions, particularly the influence of the pesticide formulations in the toxic effects, laboratory studies were performed using water samples fortified with the active ingredient and the respective formulated product (commercial product) of some pesticides (molinate, MCPA, propanil, endosulfan, chlorfenvinphos) usually applied in Portuguese paddies. The range of concentrations tested reflects the rates used by the farmers in real field conditions. The toxicity values observed in the laboratory during 1998 with the microbiotests Daphtoxkit magna F(TM), Thamnotoxkit F(TM), Artoxkit M(TM) and Algaltoxkit F(TM) are presented and discussed in this study. The results obtained until now suggest that organic solvents and surfactants present in some of the tested formulations may affect the toxicity of the sample, In fact, water samples fortified with formulated pesticides seemed to be, in the majority of the cases, more toxic than the respective active ingredients solutions, particularly in the case of the three tested crustaceans. The microbiotests used seem to be a useful tool to evaluate toxicity with relative low cost, rapidity, and simplicity, compared with the traditional tests.

Among the non-target terrestrial organisms exposed to such scenarios, earthworms are key ecological receptors widely used in ecotoxicological studies. As such, this work aims to assess the effects of two herbicide active ingredients (a.i.)-sulcotrione and penoxsulam-and their respective commercial formulations-MIKADOA (R) and VIPERA (R) (referred as Mikado and Viper)-on the avoidance behaviour of Eisenia andrei. In an attempt to enhance the ecological relevance of the generated toxicity data, the avoidance tests were run with standard (LUFA 2.2; L) and natural soils (from corn and rice fields), as long as their habitat function did not constrain the earthworm behaviour. Earthworms were bred in the lab before test conductance. The natural soils used as substrates were collected before the cropping season on corn (C) and rice (R) fields, which are integrated in a wide area exploited for agriculture. Their physico-chemical characterization evolved the determination of pH (H2O, KCl), conductivity, organic matter (OM) and clay/silt contents, and water-holding capacity (WHC). The avoidance tests intended to ascertain (1) the random distribution of earthworms in the natural soils C and R (dual-control tests), (2) the habitat function of natural soils against each other and against L soil, (3) the effect of active ingredients and formulated herbicides on E. andrei behaviour. Avoidance tests with the a.i.s were only performed in L soil. Data evaluation followed ISO (2005) guidelines. C and R soils presented higher OM (5.1% and 4.5%, respectively) and clay/silt (53.3 and 43.1, respectively) contents and WHC (107.2 and 109.9%, respectively) than L soil (4.1, 21.4 and 48.0%, correspondingly). Earthworms distributed randomly in dual-control tests, but preferred R soil significantly, relative to L or C soils. The LOEC and EC50 values calculated for sulcotrione (> 1,000.0 and 1,263.3 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) and Mikado (1,012.8 and 1,301.3 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) were much higher than those calculated for penoxsulam (100 and 80.6 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) or Viper (52.7 and 51.5 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively), when L soil was used as substrate. Moreover, the habitat function of L soil contaminated with the formulated herbicide Viper was more constrained relative to that of the a.i. penoxsulam. Viper induced higher % avoidance on E. andrei exposed to the contaminated L soil compared to that under the R soil. The response of earthworms to R (attraction) and C (avoidance) soils could be related, not only to the quantity of OM content, but also to the quality of organic and inorganic fractions of soil, beyond other intrinsic properties of soils. Both Mikado and sulcotrione impacted the behaviour of E. andrei only slightly. This endpoint was more affected under penoxsulam or Viper exposures on L soil, being the latter-formulated product even more repellent for E. andrei than the a.i. The effect of adjuvants added to the commercial formulation of Viper, may have increased the toxicity of the a.i. Thereby, our results reinforce the need for a careful assessment of the impacts of formulated products. Furthermore, since there was a reduction in earthworm % avoidance under Viper exposures on the natural soil R, it was possible that pesticide bioavailability had been reduced by its sorption to OM and clay mineral sorption sites. Though the standard L soil should be used for reproducibility and comparison means, other natural soils should be added to the assessment of chemicals, for sake of ecological relevance. Both herbicides induced avoidance behaviour on E. andrei, albeit stronger effects were denoted by penoxsulam and its respective formulated product, Viper. Overall, avoidance tests provided a sensitive, valuable and feasible response either to compare the habitat function of different standard and agricultural natural soils or to test the effect of herbicides. An effort should be made to enlarge the terrestrial ecotoxicological database as a way to fulfil the huge lack of information available for this ecosystem. In this context, additional research congregating a potential linkage between physiological activities sustaining the regular metabolism of earthworms and their avoidance behaviour or even their reproductive effects would be welcomed, especially in what regards formulated pesticides. Such approach would provide a robust and comprehensive understanding of chemical effects. Furthermore, it is encouraged that natural soils should be used to improve the reliability of chemical testing.",2009,9,137,147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0058-0,NO,NO,NO,AVOIDANCE,n/a

Szkcs ",environmental and toxicological impacts of glyphosate with its formulating adjuvant,"International Journal of Biological, Veterinary, Agricultural and Food Engineering","Environmental and toxicological characteristics of formulated pesticides may substantially differ from those of their active ingredients or other components alone. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the case of the herbicide active ingredient glyphosate. Due to its extensive application, this active ingredient was found in surface and ground water samples collected in Bks County, Hungary, in the concentration range of 0.540.98 ng/ml. The occurrence of glyphosate appeared to be somewhat higher at areas under intensive agriculture, industrial activities and public road services, but the compound was detected at areas under organic (ecological) farming or natural grasslands, indicating environmental mobility. Increased toxicity of the formulated herbicide product Roundup compared to that of glyphosate was observed on the indicator aquatic organism Daphnia magna Straus. Acute LC50 values of Roundup and its formulating adjuvant polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA) exceeded 20 and 3.1 _g/ml, respectively, while that of glyphosate (as isopropyl salt) was found to be substantially lower (690-900 _g/ml) showing good agreement with literature data. Cytotoxicity of Roundup, POEA and glyphosate has been determined on the neuroectodermal cell line, NE-4C measured both by cell viability test and holographic microscopy. Acute toxicity (LC50) of Roundup, POEA and glyphosate on NE-4C cells was found to be 0.0130.002%, 0.0170.009% and 6.462.25%, respectively (in equivalents of diluted Roundup solution), corresponding to 0.0220.003 and 53.118.5 mg/ml for POEA and glyphosate, respectively, indicating no statistical difference between Roundup and POEA and 2.5 orders of magnitude difference between these and glyphosate. The same order of cellular toxicity seen in average cell area has been indicated under quantitative cell visualization. The results indicate that toxicity of the formulated herbicide is caused by the formulating agent, but in some parameters toxicological synergy occurs between POEA and glyphosate.

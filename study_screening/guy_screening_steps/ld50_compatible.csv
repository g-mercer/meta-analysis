Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.",2019,"209","1","12","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.015","YES","YES","NO","MORPHOLOGY/BEHAVIOUR/DEVELOPMENT","n/a"

In this context, broad range bioassays have emerged providing economically viable and widely applicable alternatives due to their ability to detect the cumulative toxicity of mixtures of both known and unknown chemicals in a sample, thus allowing direct information about water quality. Here we present a low-cost, wide-range algae-based biosensor that is easy to assemble and operate by untrained users and provides direct readings. It was developed as a request of a peasant social movement organization to assess the toxicity of drinking water in rural communities affected by pesticide spraying. Two fresh water algae strains, Scenedesmus acutus and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, were immobilized in alginate beads and tested as bioindicators. After incubation with different pollutants for five days, naked eye analysis by several observers proved to be a successful method to survey algae's growth and establish the detection limits. Best detection limits were 10 ppm for technical-grade acid glyphosate, 15 ppm for glyphosate-based formulation, 50 ppb for atrazine formulation, 7.5 ppm for copper and 250 ppb for chromium. Absorbance measurements upon algae resuspension validated these results. The developed device was successfully tested in participatory workshops conducted at rural communities. Children, adults and elders with no scientific training were able to build the sensor and interpret the results, thus evaluating the quality of rain and well water used in their communities.

Its market is growing steadily concurrently with the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant transgenic crops and emergence of weeds less sensitive to glyphosate. Ephemeral and lentic waters near to agricultural lands, representing favorite habitats for amphibian reproduction and early life-stage development, may thus be contaminated by glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs) residues. Previous studies on larval anuran species highlighted increased mortality and growth effects after exposure to different GBHs in comparison to glyphosate itself, mainly because of the surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine present in the formulations. Nevertheless, these conclusions are not completely fulfilled when the early development, characterized by primary organogenesis events, is considered. In this study, we compare the embryotoxicity of Roundup((R)) Power 2.0, a new GBH formulation currently authorized in Italy, with that of technical grade glyphosate using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay Xenopus (FETAX). Our results evidenced that glyphosate was not embryolethal and only at the highest concentration (50 mg a.e./L) caused edemas. Conversely, Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 exhibited a 96 h LC50 of 24.78 mg a.e./L and a 96 h EC50 of 7.8 mg a.e./L. A Teratogenic Index of 3.4 was derived, pointing out the high teratogenic potential of the Roundup((R)) Power 2.0. Specific concentration-dependent abnormal phenotypes, such as craniofacial alterations, microphthalmia, narrow eyes and forebrain regionalization defects were evidenced by gross malformation screening and histopathological analysis. These phenotypes are coherent with those evidenced in Xenopus laevis embryos injected with glyphosate, allowing us to hypothesize that the teratogenicity observed for Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 may be related to the improved efficacy in delivering glyphosate to cells, guaranteed by the specific surfactant formulation. In conclusion, the differences in GBH formulations should be carefully considered by the authorities, since sub-lethal and/or long-term effects (e.g. teratogenicity) can be significantly modulated by the active ingredient salt type and concentration of the adjuvants. Finally, the mechanistic toxicity of glyphosate and GBHs are worthy of further research.",2018,"195","103","113","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.12.007","YES","YES","NO","DEVELOPMENT","n/a"

Factors contributing to the decline of mussel populations likely include pesticides and other aquatic contaminants: however, there is a paucity of data regarding the toxicity of even the most globally distributed pesticides, including glyphosate. to mussels. Therefore, the toxicity of several forms of glyphosate, its formulations, and a surfactant (MON 0818) used in several glyphosate formulations was determined for early life stages of Lampsilis siliquoidea, a native freshwater mussel. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were performed with a newly established American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard guide for conducting toxicity tests with freshwater mussels. Roundup's, its active ingredient, the technical-grade isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, IPA alone, and MON 0818 (the surfactant in Roundup formulations) were each acutely toxic to L. siliquoidea glochidia. MON 0818 was most toxic of the compounds tested and the 48-h median effective concentration (0.5 mg/L) for L. siliquoidea glochidia is the lowest reported for any aquatic organism tested to date. Juvenile L. siliquoidea were also acutely sensitive to MON 0818. Roundup, glyphosate IPA salt, and IPA alone. Technical-grade glyphosate and Aqua Star((R)) were not acutely toxic to glochidia or juveniles. Ranking of relative chronic toxicity of the glyphosate-related compounds to juvenile mussels was similar to the ranking of relative acute toxicity to juveniles. Growth data from chronic tests was largely inconclusive.

Despite evidence that glochidia and juvenile life stages are highly sensitive to some chemical contaminants, the effects of pesticides on early life stages of unionid mussels are largely unknown. In the United States, pesticide registration is based on toxicity data of the active ingredient, not formulations as they are sold and applied. Some pesticide formulations, however, are more toxic than their active ingredient (technical -grade pesticide) alone because of the presence of surfactants, adjuvants, or other ingredients in the formulation. The objective of the present study was to compare the toxicity of active ingredients of several current-use pesticides (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) to the toxicity of pesticide formulations to glochidia and juvenile life stages of a freshwater mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea). The atrazine formulation (Aatrex) was more toxic than technical-grade atrazine in chronic tests with juvenile L. siliquoidea. For other pesticides, acute and chronic toxicity of technical-grade pesticides were similar to the toxicity of pesticide formulations. Median effective concentrations for chlorpyrifos were 0.43 mg/L for glochidia at 48 h, 0.25 mg/L for juveniles at 96 h, and 0.06 mg/L for juveniles at 21 d. Atrazine and permethrin as well as their formulations did not cause significant acute toxicity in glochidia or juveniles at exposure concentrations approaching water-solubility limits.

Residue of the insecticide is frequently detected in trace to moderate concentration in food grains and in surface water of different freshwater ecosystems of the country. In this study, 96 h LC50 of the technical grade (94% a.i.) and commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos to freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus were determined as 90.0 and 42.0 mu g/L based on 2 h actual concentration of chlorpyrifos in water. About 96 h exposure to sublethal concentrations (0, 12.0 and 25.0 mu g/L) of the commercial formulation (20% EC) of chlorpyrifos reduced the level of hepatic glycogen, activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase, and catalase in liver and elevated the level of plasma glucose and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase in O. niloticus. About 28-day exposure to these sub-lethal concentrations caused anemia in fish, while 90 days exposure reduced growth of the fish and carcass concentration of crude protein and crude lipid as compared to control.

Unfortunately, the effects of such substances are still poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of the active neonicotinoid substance thiacloprid (TH) and the commercial product Calypso 480 SC (CA) (active compound 40.4% TH) on Mytilus galloprovincialis after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations. Mussels were tested for seven days to 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 TH and 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg L-1 CA. For this purpose, several parameters, such as cell viability of haemocytes and digestive cells, biochemical haemolymph features, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity of gills and digestive gland, as well as histology of such tissues were analysed. The sublethal concentrations of both substances lead to abatement or completely stopping the byssal fibres creation. Biochemical analysis of haemolymph showed significant changes (P < 0.01) in electrolytes ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, S-phosphor), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity and glucose concentration following exposure to both substances.

CA caused significant decrease (P < 0.05) in SOD activity in gills and in CAT activity in both tissues. Results of histological analyses showed severe damage in both digestive gland and gills in a time and concentration-dependent manner. This study provides useful information about the acute toxicity of a neonicotinoid compound and a commercial insecticide on mussels.

There is, however, a recent trend for the cultivation of cycloxydim-tolerant maize hybrids for use in maize production. We studied the acute toxic effects of the complementary herbicide Focus(A (R)) Ultra and its active ingredient cycloxydim on embryos and early-stage larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). The results indicate that the herbicide formulation is significantly more toxic than the active ingredient alone. Therefore, it is suggested that the added substances either solely or in a synergistic action with the active ingredient are responsible for adverse effects. The formulation was found to be moderately toxic to embryos but highly toxic to early larvae. Based on calculated teratogenic indices, both cycloxydim and Focus(A (R)) Ultra seem to be non-teratogenic and also the minimum Focus(A (R)) Ultra concentration to inhibit growth in embryos and larvae was close to the LC50 values.

The shallow tidal creeks and ditches that directly drain agricultural fields are home to the young of the ecologically and economically important blue crab, Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896). Massive mortality observed by peeler crab fishers led us to investigate the acute toxicity of several commercial pesticide formulations and their active ingredients to blue crab megalopae and J1-J4 stage juveniles. Twenty-four hour acute toxicity assays were conducted with the organophosphate acephate (Orthene (R)), the carbamate aldicarb, the chloro-nicotinyl imidacloprid (Trimax (TM)), the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin (Karate (R) with Zeon Technology), and the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup (R) Pro. LC50 values ranged from 0.22 mu g/L for megalopae exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin to 316,000 mu g/L for juveniles exposed to Roundup. The acute toxicities of active ingredient insecticides to blue crabs followed the order: lambda-cyhalothrin > imidacloprid approximate to aldicarb > acephate. Megalopae were almost always more sensitive than juveniles and there was little difference between the LC(50)s of each commercial formulation and its active ingredient. Treatment of intermolt megalopae with LC20 levels of Roundup resulted in significantly reduced time to metamorphosis (TTM) compared to estuarine water controls, while no differences resulted from treatment with the four active ingredient insecticides. Treatment with acephate, aldicarb, imidacloprid, and Roundup significantly increased the frequency of juveniles that died within 6 h of molting. The sensitivity of molting blue crabs to these pesticides makes frequently molting juveniles particularly vulnerable to pesticides in estuaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, technical grade alachlor, metribuzin, propachlor, and triallate were tested for comparison with the formulated herbicides. The relative toxicity of the commercial formulations, based on percent active ingredient, varied considerably. The EC50 values ranged from 1.23 mg/L for Fargo® to 5,600 mg/L for Rodeo®. Fargo®, ME4 Brominal®, and Ramrod® were moderately toxic to midge larvae; Lasso®, Sutan (+)®, and Eradicane® were slightly toxic; and Sencor® and Rodeo® were practically non-toxic. The 48-hr EC50 values of the two surfactants were nearly identical and were considered moderately toxic to midges. For two of the herbicides in which the technical grade material was tested, the inert ingredients in the formulations had a significant effect on the toxicity of the active ingredients. Fargo® was twice as toxic as technical grade triallate, whereas Sencor® was considerably less toxic than technical grade metribuzin. A comparison of the slope function values indicated that the toxic action of all the compounds occurred within a relatively narrow range. Published acute toxicity data on these compounds for other freshwater biota were tabulated and compared with our results. In general, the relative order of toxicity to C. riparius was similar to those for other freshwater invertebrates and fish. Maximum concentrations of each herbicide in bulk runoff during a projected ""critical"" runoff event were calculated as a percentage of the application rate lost in a given volume of runoff.

Feeding daphnids during the toxicity test significantly decreased BO toxicity compared to not feeding them. Aging BO (as Buctril) in hard water decreased its toxicity, and the rate of deactivation was rapid, with an estimated half-life of biological activity of 13 h. Daphnids immobilized by exposures to toxic BO concentrations for less-than-or-equal-to 6 h recovered their mobility, whereas exposures of 18 and 24 h to BO produced toxic effects in daphnids similar to those exposed for 48 h.

The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA > Roundup((R)) > glyphosate acid > IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity. Microtox((R)) bacterium and protozoa had similar sensitivities towards Roundup((R)) toxicity (i.e. IC50 from 23.5 to 29.5 mg AE/l).

Aquatic ecosystems in the proximity of agricultural areas are particularly vulnerable to pesticides, which cause underperformance or extinction of non-target sensitive species. Once in the aquatic system, these chemicals can affect biological processes at multiple levels (molecular, individual, populational), causing ecosystem imbalance across multiple scales. In this study, the effect of a commercial formulation of a herbicide (Primextra (R) Gold TZ) and its main active ingredient (a.i., S-metolachlor) was studied on a freshwater cladoceran species (Daphnia longispina), at different levels of biological organization and temporal scales. S-metolachlor is used in many herbicide formulations applied in corn/maize cultures, which is a relevant culture worldwide. As a first step, the acute and chronic effects of both commercial formulation and a.i. were quantified, and both formulations negatively affected the cladoceran's survival and reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction, number of offspring and number of broods), as well as the population's rate of increase. Whilst acute effects were comparable, the commercial formulation was slightly more toxic (EC50 was two-times lower) than the a.i. in chronic exposures, being prejudicial to D. longispina populations above 4.0 mg/L of S-metolachlor. In a second experimental step, we focused on the potential multi-generational impacts of the exposure to the a.i. alone on biochemical (lipid biomarkers, namely fatty acids) and populational responses, because of the relevance of S-metolachlor as a biosynthesis inhibitor in many herbicidal formulations. The herbicide caused a significant decrease in Daphnia fecundity (in the size of the 1st clutch), but no concomitant alterations were found in fatty acid profiles of mothers or offspring. More important, this experiment showed that S-metolachlor did not cause effects in the subsequent generation, thus suggesting that biotic communities may recover after exposure to the xenobiotic.

The development of nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the control of agricultural pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing their toxicological effects. Based upon this, the present study has investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate chitosan nanoparticles (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on non-target organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM, as well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity was also evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT (NP + DMT), and commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and larvae of Danio rerio (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology, and behavior. The nanoparticle control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size values of 283 +/- 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 +/- 0.05 and a zeta potential of -31 +/- 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate, the nanoparticles showed 301 +/- 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 +/- 0.02, a zeta potential of -27.9 +/- 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 +/- 0.32%, with slow-release overtime (52% after 48 h). The AFM images showed that both types of nanoparticles showed spherical morphology. Major toxic effects on embryo larval development were observed in commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the technical pesticide, predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With regard to the toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an increase for LC50-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior of the larvae was not affected.

Glyphosate herbicides such as brands of Roundup, are known to be toxic to daphnids. However, published findings on acute toxicity show significant discrepancies and variation across several orders of magnitude. To test the acute effects of both glyphosate and a commercial formulation of Roundup (hereafter Roundup), we conducted a series of exposure experiments with different clones and age-classes of D. magna. The results demonstrated EC50 (48) values in the low ppm-range for Roundup as well as for the active ingredient (a.i.) isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (glyphosate IPA) alone. Roundup showed slightly lower acute toxicity than glyphosate IPA alone, i.e. EC50 values of 3.7-10.6 mg a.i./l, as compared to 1.4-7.2 mg a.i./l for glyphosate IPA. However, in chronic toxicity tests spanning the whole life-cycle, Roundup was more toxic. D. magna was exposed to sublethal nominal concentrations of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l for 55 days.

D. magna was adversely affected by a near 100 % abortion rate of eggs and embryonic stages at 1.35 mg a.i./l of Roundup.

We investigated acute aquatic and terrestrial effects of the herbicide formulation Focus (R) Ultra, its active substance cycloxydim, its co-formulants solvent naphtha and docusate as well as the stabilizing adjuvant Dash (R) E.C. on larval and juvenile Rana temporaria. Aquatic toxicity was determined as 96-h LC50 values. Cycloxydim was the least toxic and solvent naphtha the most toxic substance of the formulation. The addition of Dash (R) E.C. increased the formulation toxicity substantially. Terrestrial toxicity was determined as lethal effects after a 48-h exposure to contaminated soil with 100% of the recommended field rate (FR) and as sublethal effects after the exposure to 10% of the recommended FR. The exposure to solvent naphtha and docusate at 100% FR led tomortalities of 42-100% probably due to their inhalation toxicity and dermal as well as eye irritation, respectively. Cycloxydim, Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. did not lead to any mortality. Sublethal effects on juvenile locomotor activity (i.e. moved distance) were observed for cycloxydim and the combined exposure of Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. Juvenile body masses declined significantly for all substances except for cycloxydim. The present results show that aquatic sensitivity does not predict terrestrial sensitivity. It was shown that pesticide toxicity for amphibians can highly depend on the presence and amount of co-formulants and added adjuvants. Therefore, substances included in pesticide formulations which are known to be toxic by inhalation or harmful to eyes or skin should be specifically considered in the environmental risk assessment for amphibians.

Constant usage of pesticides presents a burden for soil and causes a decrease in its health, including the negative effects on earthworms which are indicators for soil quality. The objective of this research was the assessment of the effects of two insecticides and two herbicides on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Namely, the following active ingredients and respective commercial preparations were investigated: esfenvalerate (Sumialfa), thiacloprid (Calypso), dimethenamid-p (Frontier) and prosulfocarb (Filon). Lethal concentrations (48 h) of both active ingredient and commercial preparations were determined using the filter paper contact test. Results The results showed that Calypso and Frontier were significantly more toxic than the active ingredient. Therefore, all further measurements were performed after exposure of earthworms to the commercial preparations of the pesticides. Specifically, several enzymatic biomarkers and multixenobiotic resistance activity were assessed. Additionally, a fluorescence-based assay for the determination of oxidative stress was established. Significant changes were detected for catalase, carboxylesterase and multixenobiotic activities after 48-h exposures. Also, a significant change in oxidative stress parameters could be observed for both Calypso and Frontier. Conclusions The obtained results show that commercial preparations can be more toxic than the active ingredients, and the formulations being distributed in the environment can affect earthworms on a molecular level already after short exposures.

Initially, the 96-h LC50 values of AzM and GUS were estimated for two different life stages of Xenopus laevis, embryos, and tadpoles. The actual AzM concentrations in exposure media were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. Also, the sub-lethal effects of these compounds to tadpoles were determined 24 h later at exposure concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/L using selected biomarker enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotrasferase. Differences in AChE inhibition capacities of AzM and GUS were evaluated under in vitro conditions between frogs and fish in the second part of this study. The AChE activities in a pure electrical eel AChE solution and in brain homogenates of adult Cyprinus carpio, Pelophylax ridibundus, and X. laevis were assayed after in vitro exposure to 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L concentrations of AzM and GUS. According to in vivo studies AChE, CaE and GST are important biomarkers of the effect of OP exposure while CaE may be more effective in short-term, low-concentration exposures. The results of in vitro studies showed that amphibian brain AChEs were relatively more resistant to OP exposure than fish AChEs. The resistance may be the cause of the lower toxicity/lethality of OP compounds to amphibians than to fish. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These herbicides are frequently paired with a safener, which prevents herbicidal damage to the crop without diminishing weed control. Formulated herbicide products that include safeners and other ingredients are infrequently assessed for toxicity. Our goal was to understand the potential toxicity of safeners and herbicide + safener formulations relative to the toxicity of associated active ingredients. We quantified the concentration of safeners in commercially available formulations and tested effects on nontarget algae, Raphidocelis subcapitata, when exposed to individual herbicide active ingredients, safeners, and commercial formulations. The median effective concentrations (EC50s) causing 50% reduction in population growth for the herbicide active ingredients S-metolachlor and acetochlor were 0.046 and 0.003 ppm, respectively. The safeners benoxacor, AD-67, furilazole, and dichlormid were all substantially less toxic than the herbicides and were not toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations. The commercial formulations Dual II Magnum (R), Me-Too-Lachlor II (R), Harness (R), and Surpass EC (R) all resulted in EC50 values that fell within the 95% confidence interval of the associated active ingredient herbicide. Interestingly, a significant increase in cell size was observed when algae were exposed to all the formulations, herbicides (acetochlor and S-metolachlor), and safener (dichlormid). The safener furilazole caused a significant decrease in cell size, whereas benoxacor and AD-67 had no observed effect on algae cell size. Significant algae cell size effects all occurred at or above the EC50 concentrations for each chemical, suggesting that other morphological effects may be occurring.

The technical grade cypermethrin contained 92% active ingredient (a.i.) and the commercial formulation was an emulsified concentrate (EC) containing 10% a.i. (10% EC). Based on the actual concentration in water (2 h), the commercial formulation was found to be more acutely toxic to O. niloticus (96-h LC50 = 4.85 μg/L) than the technical grade cypermethrin (96-h LC50 = 9.74 μg/L). Exposure to sub-lethal concentrations (1.25, 2.5 μg/L) of commercial cypermethrin for 96 h produced stress on the fish, which was evident from the reduction of hepatic glycogen, reduction in the activities of alkaline phosphatase, acetylcholinesterase and catalase in liver and elevation of plasma glucose level and activities of hepatic acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Exposure to these concentrations of cypermethrin for 14–28 days produced anaemia in fish. Long-term exposure (90 days) of the fish to these concentrations reduced the growth and deposition of protein and lipid in the body of fish as compared to control.It is concluded from this study that even minute concentration (1.25 μg/L) of cypermethrin (10% EC) in water can produce stress on fish.

In our study, we focused to determine acute and chronic cytotoxicity (by Aliivibrio fischeri assay) and direct hormonal activity (estrogenic and androgenic effects measured by Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLYES/BLYAS strains, respectively) of glyphosate, AMPA, polyethoxylated POE(15) and 13 GBHs from which 11 formulations do not contain polyethoxylated POE(15). Among the pure substances, neither glyphosate nor AMPA had any effects, while poly-ethoxylated POE(15) exhibited pronounced toxicity and was also estrogenic but not androgenic. Regarding the acute and chronic cytotoxicity and hormonal activity of GBHs, dilution percentages calculated from EC50 values were in the most cases by one or two order of magnitude lower than the minimum recommended dilution for agricultural and household use. Relation could not be observed between the biological effects and type of glyphosate-salts; hence toxicity could be linked to the co-formulants, which are not even declared in 3 GBHs.

However, the decrease of bee's population has been observed worldwide and besides other factors, this collapse is also related to the extensive use of pesticides. In this sense, studies involving the assessment of adverse effects and the uptake of pesticides by bees are of great concern. This work presents an analytical method for the determination of the insecticide abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris exposed via oral and topic to endpoints concentrations of active ingredients (a.i.) alone and in commercial formulations and the discussion about its mortality and uptake. For this purpose, QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged and Safe) acetate modified method was used for extraction and pesticides were determined by LC-MS/MS. The validation parameters have included: a linear range between 0.01 and 1.00 mu g mL(-1); and LOD and LOQ of 0.038 and 0.076 mu g g(-1) for abamectin and difenoconazole, respectively. The uptake of tested pesticides via oral and topic was verified by the accumulation in adult forager bees, mainly when the commercial product was tested. Mortality was observed to be higher in oral exposure than in topic tests for both pesticides. For abamectin in a commercial formulation (a.i.) no differences were observed for oral or topic exposure. On the other hand, for difenoconazole, topic exposure had demonstrated higher accumulation in bees, according to the increase of received dose. Through the results, uptake and the possible consequences of bioaccumulated pesticides are also discussed and can contribute to the knowledge about the risks involving the exposure of bees to these compounds.

Laboratory and field experiments were carried out, and the effects of cypermethrin were compared with those of a 'standard insecticide', carbofuran, widely used for pest control in rice, and a 'positive control', chlorfenvinphos, expected to be toxic to fish in rice paddies at insecticidally effective rates. Acute toxicity tests in the laboratory with the technical materials on the fish Tilapia nilotica showed cypermethrin, with a 96 h LC50 value of 2 μg/ℓ, to be some 20 times more toxic than chlorfenvinphos, with a 96 h LC50 value of 39 μg/ℓ, and some 250 times more toxic than carbofuran with a 96 h LC50 of 480 μg/ℓ. The LC50 values obtained from laboratory tests with formulated products (cypermethrin EC, chlorfenvinphos granules and carbofuran granules) on T. nilotica and Cyprinus carpio were broadly in agreement with those obtained from the tests with the technical materials and confirmed C. carpio to have a similar susceptibility to that of T. nilotica. However, a field experiment carried out in paddy rice in Korea with commercial formulations and at commercial application rates showed that mortality of caged C. carpio was much less with cypermethrin (< 15%) than with chlorfenvinphos (97%) or carbofuran (67%). A second field experiment in Spain where cypermethrin was applied by air resulted in no mortality of caged C. carpio held in the paddy. It is concluded that the limited toxic effects of cypermethrin on fish in the field, when compared with those of chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran, make it acceptable for use in rice. The effects of cypermethrin were limited in comparison with those of chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran because only very low application rates of cypermethrin are needed to give pest control. The penetration of the liquid cypermethrin formulations into the water was also lower than that of the granular insecticides and, finally, cypermethrin was more rapidly lost from water. Together, these factors are sufficient to explain the minimal toxic effects of cypermethrin in the field when compared with chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran, despite its considerably higher acute toxicity determined in laboratory tests. © 1984.",1984,"3","151","165","10.1016/0261-2194(84)90050-4","YES","NO","YES","n/a","old paper with no CIs.

The sulfonylureas chlorsulfuron and rimsulfuron inhibited the growth of one of two Azospirillum and one of four Pseudomonas strains, while the imidazolinones imazapyr and imazethapyr were effective on two out of five Bacillus isolates. Surfactants in commercial formulation significantly enhanced rimsulfuron toxicity. With the exception of one Azospirillum strain, the differential tolerance of rhizobacteria to these herbicides was related to a differential sensitivity of their target, the activity of the first enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). Greenhouse pot studies were performed to assess the occurrence of inhibitory effects on bacterial growth in field conditions. Maize seedlings were bacterized with the two strains which had shown in vitro sensitivity to sulfonylureas.

Flow‐through acute toxicity testing with measured concentrations of technical‐grade fenvalerate and a 30% active ingredient emulsifiable concentrate (EC) of the insecticide was conducted. Steady‐state LC50 values were reached by 72 and 120 to 168 h, respectively, in tests with technical‐grade and EC formulations of this insecticide. Initially, technical‐grade fenvalerate was more toxic; the 96–h LC50s for technical‐grade fenvalerate and the EC were 0.69 and 0.99 μg/L, respectively. By 168 h, an LC50 of 0.75 μg/L was determined for the EC, indicating that the incipient lethalities of the two formulations were similar. Fenvalerate concentration factors and residue levels in fish showed no significant differences between formulations. Residue levels associated with mortality decreased slightly with increasing fenvalerate water concentrations and ranged (mean) from approximately 1,000 to 1,500 ng/g. Levels in fish that survived testing increased with increasing exposure concentrations and ranged from about 600 to 900 ng/g. Concentration factors of 187 to 1,860 were calculated, with a mean of 1,670, as determined from fish that survived testing. The time required to accumulate residues was greater with the EC and contributed to a significantly slower uptake rate.

While contrasting results have been observed related with its impact on soil microbial communities, more studies are necessary to elucidate the potential effects of the herbicide. Differences in tolerance detected by Pollution Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) approach could reflect these effects. The objective of the present study was to assess the tolerance to glyphosate (the active ingredient and a commercial formulation) of contrasting soils with (H) and without (NH) history of exposure. The hypothesis of a higher tolerance in H soils due to a sustained selection pressure on community structure was tested through the PICT approach. Results indicated that tolerance to glyphosate is not consistent with previous history of exposure to the herbicide either for the active ingredient or for a commercial formulation. Soils of H and NH sites were also characterized in order to determine to what extent they differ in their functional diversity and structure of microbial communities. Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Quantitative Real Time PCR (Q-PCR) indicated high similarity of Eubacteria profiles as well as no significant differences in abundance, respectively, between H and NH sites. Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) indicated some differences in respiration of specific sources but functional diversity was very similar as reflected by catabolic evenness (E). These results support PICT assay, which ideally requires soils with differences in their exposure to the contaminant but minor differences in other characteristics.

Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max (TM) (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick (TM) (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49 mg L-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick (TM). Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period. The mobility of glyphosate in the soils proved very low thus risks to aquatic ecosystems due to application of glyphosate-based herbicides may occur rather in case of direct contamination of surface water.

In this study, the effects of carbofuran and diuron and their mixtures on the microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata were investigated. For this purpose, toxicity tests were performed with the single compounds (active ingredients and commercial formulations) and their combinations (only active ingredients). According to the results, the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations to R. subcapitata was similar. In the single exposures, both carbofuran and diuron inhibited significantly the it subcapitntn growth and caused physiological (chlorophyll a content) and morphological (complexity and cell size) changes in cells, as captured by flow cytometry single-cell properties. Regarding the mixture toxicity tests, data fitted to both reference models, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and evidenced significant deviations. After the CA fitting, dose-ratio dependent deviation had the best fit to the data, demonstrating synergism caused mainly by diuron and antagonism caused mainly by carbofuran. After fitting the IA model, a synergistic deviation represented the best fit for the diuron and carbofuran mixtures. In general, the two reference models indicated the occurrence of synergism in the mixtures of these compounds, especially when diuron was the dominant chemical in the combinations. The increased toxicity caused by the mixture of these pesticides could pose a greater environmental risk for phytoplankton.

Acute and chronic tests were conducted with diuron and carbofuran active ingredients and their commercial formulations, Diuron Nortox (R) 500 SC and Furadan (R) 350 SC, respectively. The sensitivity range of P. caudatum to reference substance sodium chloride was established. A preliminary risk assessment of diuron and carbofuran for Brazilian water bodies was performed. The tests indicated that toxicity of pure diuron and its commercial formulation was similar, while the commercial product carbofuran was more toxic than its pure form. In acute tests, readings were carried out at 2, 3, 4 and 6 h and showed an increase of mortality with increasing exposure time. The sensitivity of P. caudatum to NaCl ranged from 3.31 to 4.44 g L-1, averaging 3.88 g L-1. For diuron, the 6 h LC50 was 64.6 +/- 3.3 mg L-1 for its pure form and 62.4 +/- 2.5 mg L-1 for its commercial formulation. Carbofuran active ingredient was less toxic than that of diuron, presenting a 6 h LC50 of 142.0 +/- 2.4 mg L-1 for its pure form and 70.4 +/- 2.2 mg L-1 for its commercial product. Chronic tests showed that these pesticides cause significant decrease on population growth, generation number and biomass of P. caudatum. The 24 h IC50 was 7.10 +/- 0.58 mg L-1 for pure diuron, 6.78 +/- 0.92 mg L-1 for commercial diuron, 22.95 +/- 3.57 mg L-1 for pure carbofuran and 4.98 +/- 0.62 mg L-1 for commercial carbofuran. Preliminary risk assessment indicated that diuron and carbofuran present potential ecological risks for Brazilian water bodies. P. caudatum was a suitable and sensitive test organism to evaluate diuron and carbofuran toxicity to freshwater protozooplankton and, taking into account the relevant role of protozoans in aquatic environments, we strongly recommend its inclusion in ecotoxicological studies.

In this study, quintozene and a formulation of quintozene widely used on golf Courses, FFII (TM) were tested for toxicity to early life stages of the Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes. For medaka exposed in static non-renewal assays to quintozene for 17 d from the fertilized egg stage to yolk resorption at the fry stage, the LC50 for mortality was a nominal concentration of 707 mu g l(-1) and the effective concentration for 50% hatch (i.e. EC50) was a nominal concentration of 71 mu g l(-1). Eggs and fry showed developmental abnormalities, including ocular malformations and retarded development of the brain, notochord, organs and body segmentation, which were interpreted as teratogenic responses to exposure to PCNB. For medaka exposed to quintozene, the LOECs for abnormalities of the eye and all other developmental abnormalities were 750 and 100 mu g l(-1), respectively. In medaka exposed to the FFII (TM) formulation, similar patterns of mortalities, reduced hatching success and developmental abnormalities were observed, but at higher test concentrations that were consistent with the proportion of quintozene in the formulation.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the toxicity of glyphosate, its by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and two commercial formulations, Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and Roundup Allees et Terrasses (R) (R-AT), containing glyphosate as the active ingredient, on the early life stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h. Experiments involving both endpoints included range finding experiments for herbicide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100,000 mu g L-1. This range was then narrowed down in order to determine precise EC50 values. Actual concentrations of the herbicide were determined at the beginning and after 48 h (embryotoxicity) and 24 h (metamorphosis) to evaluate the potential temporal variation in the concentrations. During embryo-larval development, no mortalities were recorded at any of the concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, whereas no embryos or D-shaped larvae could be observed after exposure to 10,000 mu g L-1 of R-EX or R-AT. Compared with the controls, no effects on embryo-larval development were recorded between 0.1 and 1000 mu g L-1, regardless of the chemical tested. Above a threshold, which varied according to the chemical used, the gradient of herbicide concentrations correlated with a gradient of severity of abnormality ranging from normal larvae to arrested development (an old embryo stage). The EC50 values were 28,315 and 40,617 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and its metabolite, respectively, but much lowered values of 1133 and 1675 mu g L-1 for R-EX and R-AT, respectively. Metamorphosis tests also revealed a significant difference between molecules, as the EC50 values exceeded 100,000 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and AMPA but were as low as 6366 and 6060 mu g L-1 for the commercial formulations, which appeared relatively more toxic. Overall, the embryo-larval development of C. gigas was more sensitive to glyphosate-based herbicides compared to various endpoints studied in regulatory model organisms, and embryos and D-shaped larvae were more sensitive compared to pediveliger larvae.

In this study, the toxicity of the metals Cu, Pb and Zn, the herbicide glyphosate (active product and ATANOR® formulation) and their binary combinations, was assessed on two green algae species (the standard species Raphidocelis subcapitata and a native strain of Scenedesmus acutus isolated from Burgos Stream [Buenos Aires]). The bioassays were carried out applying a concentration range of 0.5 mg L - 20 mg/L, in incubations lasting 7 days after which the algal density was estimated. To obtain the effective concentrations inhibiting 10, 20 and 50% of the growth (EC10, EC20 and EC50) of individual substances and their combinations, the percentage of growth inhibition (%I) was modeled as a function of each concentration by a nonlinear fit. According to the EC50 obtained for each species, the toxicity of Cu and Zn was higher in R. subcapitata (7.47±2.14 and 6.51±2.26 mg/L, respectively) than in S. acutus (10.90±3.75 and> 20 mg/L), while Pb and glyphosate active compound were not toxic for neither of the two strains. ATANOR® glyphosate was toxic only to R. subcapitata (EC50=12.00±3.10 mg/L). According to the EC10 and EC20 values of the individual substances and the binary combinations, S. acutus showed higher sensitivity than R. subcapitata. From the analysis of toxic units (TU), the combinatios Cu+Zn, Cu+glyphosate ATANOR® and Zn+glyphosate ATANOR® showed antagonistic effects on R. subcapitata (according to the TU values obtained from EC20 and EC50), while the Cu+Pb and Cu+Zn combinations showed synergistic and antagonistic effects, respectively, on S. acutus (according to the TU values obtained from the EC20).

Four types of organosilicones were mixed with imidacloprid at different concentrations. The toxicity of the mixture to C. nipponensis was measured under laboratory conditions. The LC50 and LC30 of imidacloprid applied alone and in combination with 0.05% organosilicone were determined. Imidacloprid (LC30) applied alone or in combination with 0.05% organosilicone was used to treat second instar larvae of C. nipponensis; thereafter, its effects on the growth, development, longevity, reproduction, and predatory ability of C. nipponensis were evaluated The results demonstrated that the organosilicone Silwet L-77 reduced the LC50 and LC30 of imidacloprid to 6.09 (95% CI: 2.31-9.42) and 10.95 mg/L (95% CI: 8.16-13.63), respectively, and enhanced imidacloprid toxicity to C. nipponensis, as reflected by the resulting extension of the growth and developmental period, reduction in female longevity, and inhibition of reproduction.

We address whether solution properties affect the fate of Analar (Analar-PPT) or industrial PPT (PPT-Ind) propetamphos formulations and whether propetamphos and metal toxicant effects are additive, antagonistic or synergistic? The sorption, desorption, biodegradation and microbial toxicology of Analar-PPT and PPT-Ind were investigated in Conwy River and estuary sediment. Results showed elevated salinity enhanced PPT sorption, while higher salinities increased PPT-Ind retention. Higher dissolved organic matter (DOM) and low salinity slowed Analar-PVT biodegradation (1.9 x 10(-3) h(-1)). Analar-PPT and PPT-Ind biodegradation was further reduced by low salinity, high DOM and dissolved Zn and Pb (6.3 x 10(-4) h(-1), 1100 h t(1/2) for Analar-PPT; 7.5 x 10(-4) h(-1), 924 h t(1/2) for PPT-Ind).

The present study focuses on evaluating the effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its formulations (Rampa (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on non-target aquatic macrophytes. The two formulation types differ in their active ingredient release and presumed environmental impact. In order to cover different ecological traits, two species of aquatic macrophytes - the floating monocot Lemna minor and the rooted dicot Myriophyllum aquaticum, were used as test models. The results of this study revealed differences in the sensitivity of tested plants to clomazone. Based on the most sensitive parameters, M. aquaticum proved to be more sensitive than L. minor to the technical ingredient and both formulations. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach that was tried out in an attempt to create a higher tier step of risk assessment of clomazone for primary producers indicates that tests on rooted macrophytes can add value in risk assessment of plant protection products. The capsule formulation of clomazone was less toxic than the emulsion for L. minor, but more toxic for M. aquaticum. The most toxic for L. minor was the emulsifiable concentrate formulation Rampa (R) EC, followed by technical clomazone (EC50 33.3 and 54.0 mg a.i./l, respectively), while the aqueous capsule suspension formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS did not cause adverse effects. On the other hand, the most toxic for M. aquaticum was the formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS, followed by technical clomazone and the formulation Rampa (R) EC, demonstrating a greater effect of the capsule formulation.

This phenomenon is demonstrated in the case of the herbicide active ingredient glyphosate. Due to its extensive application, this active ingredient was found in surface and ground water samples collected in Bks County, Hungary, in the concentration range of 0.540.98 ng/ml. The occurrence of glyphosate appeared to be somewhat higher at areas under intensive agriculture, industrial activities and public road services, but the compound was detected at areas under organic (ecological) farming or natural grasslands, indicating environmental mobility. Increased toxicity of the formulated herbicide product Roundup compared to that of glyphosate was observed on the indicator aquatic organism Daphnia magna Straus. Acute LC50 values of Roundup and its formulating adjuvant polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA) exceeded 20 and 3.1 _g/ml, respectively, while that of glyphosate (as isopropyl salt) was found to be substantially lower (690-900 _g/ml) showing good agreement with literature data. Cytotoxicity of Roundup, POEA and glyphosate has been determined on the neuroectodermal cell line, NE-4C measured both by cell viability test and holographic microscopy. Acute toxicity (LC50) of Roundup, POEA and glyphosate on NE-4C cells was found to be 0.0130.002%, 0.0170.009% and 6.462.25%, respectively (in equivalents of diluted Roundup solution), corresponding to 0.0220.003 and 53.118.5 mg/ml for POEA and glyphosate, respectively, indicating no statistical difference between Roundup and POEA and 2.5 orders of magnitude difference between these and glyphosate. The same order of cellular toxicity seen in average cell area has been indicated under quantitative cell visualization. The results indicate that toxicity of the formulated herbicide is caused by the formulating agent, but in some parameters toxicological synergy occurs between POEA and glyphosate.

Therefore, thorough assessment of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is a high-priority task. An enzyme inhibition-based assay is used in this study as a convenient and quick tool to study the effects of pesticides at the molecular level. The contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulations has been studied by analyzing effects of 7 active ingredients of pesticides (AIas) and 10 commercial formulations based on them (AIfs) on the function of a wide range of enzyme assay systems differing in complexity (single-, coupled, and three-enzyme assay systems). Results have been compared with the effects of AIas and AIfs on bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum. Mostly, AIfs produce a considerably stronger inhibitory effect on the activity of enzyme assay systems and bioluminescence of the luminous bacterium than AIas, which confirms the contribution of formulants to toxicological properties of the pesticide formulation. Results of the current study demonstrate that “inert” ingredients are not ecotoxicologically safe and can considerably augment the inhibitory effect of pesticide formulations; therefore, their use should be controlled more strictly. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of the enzymes used for assays do not show any changes in the protein structure in the presence of commercial pesticide formulations during the assay procedure. This finding suggests that pesticides produce the inhibitory effect on enzymes through other mechanisms. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,"24","","","10.3390/ijms24032268","YES","NO","YES","n/a","used a bioluminescent bacteria.

Strategies are sought to reduce the toxicity of this fungicide and alternative treatments are welcome. An alternative could be the use of clove oil, which has Eugenol as its major compound, and has antifungal potential against G. cingulata, however, Eugenol is susceptible to degradation processes which may compromise its efficacy. The nanoencapsulation of Mancozeb and Eugenol is a possible strategy to overcome the limitations of toxicity, solubility and instability of these compounds. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop nanoemulsions containing Mancozeb (0.1 mg/mL) and Eugenol (33 mg/mL), isolated or associated, and evaluate the safety of these formulations through cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and ecotoxicity tests. Nanoemulsions were developed by the spontaneous emulsification method, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in healthy human cells through MTT, Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and Picogreen tests, and ecotoxicity assessment was carried out using the chronic toxicity test in springtails. After preparation, the physicochemical characterization of the nanoemulsions were performed which presented mean particle size between 200 and 300 nm, polydispersity index less than 0.3, negative zeta potential and acid pH. The nanoencapsulation was able to avoid the reduction of the cell viability caused by Mancozeb, while Eugenol was shown to be safe for cell use in both free and nanostructured forms, however the association of the two active compounds showed toxicity in the higher doses of Mancozeb. In the ecotoxicity tests, both free Mancozeb and Eugenol forms presented high toxic potential for soil, whereas the nanoencapsulation of these compounds did not cause a reduction in number of springtails.

An herbicide (Montana (R)) and fungicide (Bravo500 (R)) formulations were investigated and results were compared to the isolated active substances of each formulation (glyphosate and chlorothalonil, respectively). Tests were performed using the invertebrate Folsomia candida as test species and an agricultural natural soil. Degradation rate tests were determined under aerobic conditions at 20 +/- 2 degrees C, using an ecologically relevant concentration of 5 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) of soil for both chemicals. Results demonstrated degradation half-lives (DT50) of 2.2 days forMontana (R) and 2.8 days when pure glyphosate was tested. Values of 1.1 and 2.9 days were registered for Bravo500 (R) and its active substance chlorothalonil, respectively. There were no effects on survival for the tested concentrations of both forms of the herbicide (up to 17.3 mg kg(-1)). However, reproduction was affected, but only by the herbicide formulation, with an estimated EC50 value of 4.63 mg (a.i.) kg(-1). Effects were most unlikely related to glyphosate. For chlorothalonil, both tested forms affected survival and reproduction. The estimated LC50 values were 117 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) and 73.5 mg (a.i.) kg(-1), and the EC50 41.3 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) and 14.9 mg kg(-1) for the formulation and the active ingredient, respectively. The effects of the active ingredient were significantly stronger, indicating the major influence of the active substance in the effects caused also by the formulation.

The biochemical pathway for aromatic amino acid synthesis (Shikimate pathway), which is specifically inhibited by glyphosate, is shared by plants and numerous bacterial species. Several in vitro studies have shown that various groups of intestinal bacteria may be differently affected by glyphosate. Here, we present results from an animal exposure trial combining deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial community with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolic profiling of aromatic amino acids and their downstream metabolites. We found that glyphosate as well as the commercial formulation Glyfonova (R) 450 PLUS administered at up to fifty times the established European Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI = 0.5 mg/kg body weight) had very limited effects on bacterial community composition in Sprague Dawley rats during a two-week exposure trial. The effect of glyphosate on prototrophic bacterial growth was highly dependent on the availability of aromatic amino acids, suggesting that the observed limited effect on bacterial composition was due to the presence of sufficient amounts of aromatic amino acids in the intestinal environment. A strong correlation was observed between intestinal concentrations of glyphosate and intestinal pH, which may partly be explained by an observed reduction in acetic acid produced by the gut bacteria. We conclude that sufficient intestinal levels of aromatic amino acids provided by the diet alleviates the need for bacterial synthesis of aromatic amino acids and thus prevents an antimicrobial effect of glyphosate in vivo. It is however possible that the situation is different in cases of human malnutrition or in production animals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

For this reason elevated concentrations are expected in aquatic environment. Despite this fact, there is still a lack of data available on its possible risk for the environment. In this study, the potential hazards of imidacloprid and its commercial product Confidor SL 200 to aquatic environment were identified by the acute and chronic toxicity assessment using bacteria Vibrio fischeri, algae Desmodesmus subspicatus, crustacean Daphnia magna, fish Danio, rerio and the ready biodegradability determination. We found out, that imidacloprid was not highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial product. Imidacloprid was found persistent in water samples and not readily biodegradable in aquatic environment. Due to increased future predicted use of commercial products containing imidacloprid and the findings of this work, we recommend additional toxicity and biodegradability studies of other commercial products with imidacloprid as an active constituent.

The present study assessed the acute toxicity and genotoxicity of the GLY-based formulation Atanor 48 (ATN) and its major constituents GLY, surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA), as well as the main metabolite of GLY aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) on non-target aquatic organisms. The toxic effects of these chemicals were evaluated in the fish embryo acute toxicity test with zebrafish (Danio rerio), while genotoxic effects were investigated in the comet assays with cells from zebrafish larvae and rainbow trout gonad-2 (RTG-2). GLY and AMPA caused no acute toxic effect, while ATN and POEA induced significant lethal effects in zebrafish (LC50-96 h 76.50 mg/L and 5.49 mg/L, respectively). All compounds were genotoxic in comet experiments with zebrafish larvae (LOEC 1.7 mg/L for GLY, ATN, AMPA and 0.4 mg/L for POEA). Unlike in vivo, only POEA induced DNA damage in RTG-2 cells (LOEC 1.6 mg/L), suggesting that it is a direct acting genotoxic agent. In summary, these data indicate that the lethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages can be ranked in the following order from most to least toxic: surfactant POEA > formulation ATN > active ingredient GLY approximate to metabolite AMPA. Genotoxic effects were observed in both RTG-2 cells (only POEA) and zebrafish (all test compounds) with the lowest tested concentrations.

The toxicity of five household pesticides (three herbicides and two insecticides) was investigated using a bacterial cytotoxicity bioassay and an algal photosynthesis bioassay. The commercial products were up to an order of magnitude more toxic than the active ingredient(s) alone. In addition, two commercial products with the same listed active ingredients in the same ratio had a 600 x difference in potency. These results clearly demonstrate that additives in commercial formulations are significant contributors to the toxicity of household pesticides. The toxicity of pesticides in aquatic systems is therefore likely underestimated by conventional chemical monitoring and risk assessment when only the active ingredients are considered. Regulators and customers should require more clarity from pesticide manufacturers about the nature and concentrations of not only the active ingredients, but also additives used in commercial formulations.

We investigated the direct effects of a range of chemical herbicides and adjuvants upon conidia of M. amaranthi and found that many herbicides and most adjuvants were strongly inhibitory to germination. On the other hand, M. amaranthi was compatible with a selection of post-emergence herbicides commonly used in midwestern weed management systems, including carfentrazone, chloransulam, and imazethapyr. Most glyphosate products suppressed or abolished germination of M. amaranthi conidia, but by testing adjuvants commonly used in glyphosate products and technical-grade glyphosate salts, it was revealed that this inhibition was due to formulation additives and not the active ingredient. When glyphosate and conidia of M. amaranthi were sprayed onto common waterhemp seedlings, the herbicide predisposed plants to infection by M amaranthi.

Thus, 2,4-D does not seem to induce oxidative stress during early pregnancy in mice at the doses administered, indicating that this mechanism is probably not involved in mediating herbicide toxicity at these dose levels. Furthermore, since no manifestations of developmental toxicity were observed after administration of the herbicide, it is also possible that 2,4-D may not produce any early developmental toxicity at the low environmentally relevant doses tested in this animal model.

Observed behaviors were identified and categorized by means of a ranking system according to the loss of mobility. Results of acute lethal effects indicate higher potency for SherpaA (R) at this level of assessment. All effects on behavior showed an increasing degree of injury as insecticide concentration increased. Organisms exposed to technical grade CY showed lower body length with respect to controls from 3.44 A mu g CY/L to higher concentrations, whereas those exposed to SherpaA (R) exhibited lower growth from 0.83 A mu g CY/L. Both forms of the tested insecticide caused abnormalities between 0.34 and 4.18 A mu g CY/L, but 100% of malformed individuals was detected from 34.4 A mu g CY/L for those exposed to the technical grade CY, and from 8.36 A mu g CY/L for those exposed to SherpaA (R). This study proposes the use of easily identifiable and distinguishable sublethal end-points.

However, concerns regarding its safety, side effects, and impact on other organisms have increased in recent years. This is the first study to analyze a large set of recent and historical Escherichia coli isolates varying in pathogenicity and beta-lactam resistance from different host species for their susceptibility to glyphosate isopropylamine salt (IPA), the active ingredient of the herbicide, and to a complete glyphosate-containing formulation (Roundup LB Plus). For this, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for 238 E. coli isolates by broth microdilution in Mueller Hinton I media followed by the statistical analyses using Mann-Whitney-U test, multivariable analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a multivariable proportional-odds ordinal regression model. While the overall MIC distribution was narrow and lacked a highly resistant sub-population for both substances, statistical analyses revealed small but significant associations between glyphosate resistance levels and different factors tested. Mean MIC values for the entire dataset showed a higher level of resistance to the complete glyphosate-containing formulation (40 mg/ml IPA) than to pure glyphosate (10 mg/ml IPA) in E. coli. Isolates that originated from poultry had significantly higher MIC values for both pure glyphosate and the complete formulation. Pathogenic and non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (non-ESBL) E. coli isolates each showed significantly higher MIC values compared to commensals and ESBL-producing E. coli in pure glyphosate, but not in the complete formulation. Recently sampled isolates showed statistically higher MICs than the isolates of the historic standard E. coli collection of reference in pure glyphosate, when tested by nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test, but not in the multivariable model. Further investigations are necessary to confirm whether these associations have a casual relationship with the glyphosate use or are the consequence of co-selection due to the increased application rates of antibiotics, heavy metals or other biocides. A possible accumulation of pathogenic bacteria in livestock animals fed with glyphosate-containing feed should also be considered. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

However, the possible risks of these new nanopesticides to non-target organisms are still sparsely investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a nanoformulation of atrazine (nano_ATZ) to non-target soil invertebrates. The effect was compared with the commercial formulation (Gesaprim (R)) and atrazine (the pure active ingredient, a.i.), using the a.i. in a field concentration range using the soil invertebrate, Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochaeta) as the non-target organisms. The endpoints evaluated included avoidance behaviour (2d), hatching success (11d), survival and reproduction (based on both the standard enchytraeid reproduction test (28d) and on the full life cycle test (46d)). Results showed that enchytraeids avoided soil spiked with Gesaprim and atrazine (a.i.), but not nano_ATZ. While all tested atrazine forms affected the hatching success (11d, early development stage), the toxicity in later stages, as measured in terms of survival and reproduction (46d) showed that Gesaprim was the least toxic (EC10 ca. 200 mg kg(-1)), followed by nano_ATZ (EC10 ca. 180 mg kg(-1)) and atrazine (a.i.)

Nanosized encapsulated pesticides offer a variety of enhanced features including controlled release and improved efficacy. Despite the presence of nanosized capsules in current-use pesticide formulations, the analytical and toxicological implications of encapsulation are uncertain. To explore this issue quantitatively, we fractionated the capsules of a commercially available encapsulated insecticide formulation (γ-cyhalothrin active ingredient) into two size ranges: a large fraction (LF), with an average hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) of 758 nm, and a small fraction (SF), with an average HDD of 449 nm. We developed a novel extraction method demonstrating a time-dependent inhibition of γ-cyhalothrin from capsules for up to 48 h. An acute immobilization test with a freshwater macroinvertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia) revealed that the SF was significantly more toxic than both the LF and the free γ-cyhalothrin treatment (EC50 = 0.18 µg/L, 0.57 µg/L, and 0.65 µg/L, respectively). These findings highlight that encapsulation of γ-cyhalothrin mitigates hydrophobic partitioning in a time-dependent manner and influences toxicity in a size-dependent manner. Recognizing the analytical and toxicological nuances of various nanosized capsules can contribute to innovation in pesticide formulations and may lead to more comprehensive pesticide regulation. © 2019 by the authors.

To evaluate the combined effects of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) and indoxacarb, their independent and joint toxicities to two insects, Spodoptera exigua and Agrotis ipsilon, and the aquatic organism, Daphnia magna, were determined. Results showed that all of five tested QACs increased the toxicity of indoxacarb to S. exigua and A. ipsilon.

Carefully designed and un-confounded laboratory toxicity tests are crucial for accurate assessment of potential risks from the original formulation of Roundup ® to North American amphibians in aquatic environments. The formulated mixture of this herbicide as well as its components, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate and the surfactant MON 0818 (containing polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA)) were separately tested in 96h acute toxicity tests with Gosner stage 25 larval anurans. Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo fowleri, and Hyla chrysoscelis were reared from egg masses and exposed to a series of 11 concentrations of the original formulation of Roundup ® herbicide, nine concentrations of MON 0818 and three concentrations of IPA salt of glyphosate in static (non-renewal) aqueous laboratory tests. LC50 values are expressed as glyphosate acid equivalents (ae) or as mg/L for MON 0818 concentrations for comparison between the formulation and components. R. pipiens was the most sensitive of five species with 96h-LC50 values for formulation tests, for the five species, ranging from 1.80 to 4.22mg ae/L, and MON 0818 exposures with 96h-LC50 values ranging from 0.68 to 1.32mg/L. No significant mortality was observed during exposures of 96h for any of the five species exposed to glyphosate IPA salt at concentrations up to 100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). These results agree with previous studies which have noted that the surfactant MON 0818 containing POEA contributes the majority of the toxicity to the herbicide formulations for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and amphibians. These study results suggest that anurans are among the most sensitive species, and emphasize the importance of testing the herbicide formulation in addition to its separate components to accurately characterize the toxicity and potential risk of the formulation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",2012,"78","128","133","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.11.025","YES","YES","NO","n/a","n/a"

Acute and chronic intoxication of humans and animals, contamination of soil, water and food are the consequences of the current demand and sales of these products. In addition, pesticides such as glyphosate are sold in commercial formulations which have inert ingredients, substances with unknown composition and proportion. Facing this scenario, toxicological studies that investigate the interaction between the active principle and the inert ingredients are necessary. The following work proposed comparative toxicology studies between glyphosate and its commercial formulation using the alternative model Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms were exposed to different concentrations of the active ingredient (glyphosate in monoisopropylamine salt) and its commercial formulation. Reproductive capacity was evaluated through brood size, morphological analysis of oocytes and through the MD701 strain (bcIs39), which allows the visualization of germ cells in apoptosis. In addition, the metal composition in the commercial formulation was analyzed by ICP-MS. Only the commercial formulation of glyphosate showed significant negative effects on brood size, body length, oocyte size, and the number of apoptotic cells. Metal analysis showed the presence of Hg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb in the commercial formulation, which did not cause reprotoxicity at the concentrations found. However, metals can bio-accumulate in soil and water and cause environmental impacts. Finally, we demonstrated that the addition of inert ingredients increased the toxic profile of the active ingredient glyphosate in C. elegans, which reinforces the need of components description in the product labels.

As an example, testing on the formulated product is waived in Europe using an assessment of data for the constituent active substance(s). This is often not the case globally, because some countries require acute toxicity tests with every formulated product, thereby triggering animal welfare concerns through unnecessary testing. A database of 383 formulated products was compiled from acute toxicity studies conducted with northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (unpublished regulatory literature). Of the 383 formulated products studied, 159 contained only active substances considered functionally nontoxic (median lethal dose [LD50] > highest dose tested). Of these, 97% had formulated product LD50 values of > 2000 mg formulated product/kg (limit dose), indicating that no new information was obtained in the formulated product study. Furthermore, defined (point estimated) LD50 values for formulated products were compared with LD50 values predicted from toxicity of the active substance(s). This demonstrated that predicted LD50 values were within 2-fold and 5-fold of the measured formulated product LD50 values in 90% and 98% of cases, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that avian acute toxicity testing of formulated products is largely unnecessary and should not be routinely required to assess avian acute toxicity. In particular, when active substances are known to be functionally nontoxic, further formulated product testing adds no further information and unnecessarily increases bird usage in testing. A further analysis highlights the fact that significant reductions (61% in this dataset) could be achieved by using a sequential testing design (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 223), as opposed to established single-stage designs.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations.

Adverse effects were analyzed by means of the isotoxicity curves for lethality, malformations, stage-dependent susceptibility, and ultrastructural features. For all experimental conditions, the CF was more toxic, up to 10 times, than the active ingredient, being the open mouth stage (S. 21) the most susceptible to the herbicide. For continuous treatment conditions, the early embryonic development was the most susceptible to 2,4-D and the LC50s for 96 and 168 h were 9.06 and 7.76 mg L(-1) respectively. In addition, both the active ingredient and the CF were highly teratogenic, resulting in reduced body size, delayed development, microcephaly, agenesis of gills, and abnormal cellular proliferation processes as the main adverse effects. According to US EPA, 2,4-D in agricultural scenarios may be up to three times higher than the NOEC values for teratogenic effects reported in this study. Therefore, they might represent a risk for amphibians. This study also points out the relevance of reporting the susceptibility of embryos at different developmental stages to both the active ingredient and the CF of agrochemicals in order to protect nontarget organisms.

While pesticides are used for the improvement of crop yields, they also present a burden for soil organisms. To understand the complex effects of pesticides on soil organisms, it is important to test these effects in soil exposures to include influences of the soil matrix on the toxicity. Therefore, the aim of this study was the assessment of the effects pesticides on earthworm Eisenia andrei. In an initial screening, active ingredients and commercial preparations were tested for comparison. Since the commercial preparations showed a higher toxicity, all further investigations (biomarkers, multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) activity, and avoidance behavior) were performed using the commercial pesticide formulations only: Sumialfa (esfenvalerate), Calypso (thiacloprid), Frontier (dimethenamid-p), and Filon (prosulfocarb). Significant differences in avoidance behavior were observed for Filon and Frontier. All pesticides inhibited the MXR activity and affected oxidative stress-related markers. Frontier was the only pesticide that did not affect enzymatic biomarkers related to neurotransmission. The results show the potential hazards associated with the usage of the tested pesticides and the importance of evaluating the effects of commercial pesticide preparations for a more realistic insight into the adverse effects on the environment. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,"13","","","10.3390/agriculture13020271","YES","NO","YES","BEHAVIOUR/OXIDATIVE STRESS","request data and try and calculate LC50"

Commercial insecticide formulations, however, contain a significant proportion (>90%) of so-called inert ingredients, which may alter the toxicity of the active ingredient(s). This study compares the sublethal toxicity of two insecticides, the pyrethroid bifenthrin, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil, to their commercial formulations, Talstar (R) and Termidor (R). Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff. We used larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), to determine effects on growth and swimming performance after short-term (24 h) exposure to sublethal concentrations of pure insecticides and the respective formulations. Significantly enhanced 7 d growth was observed at 10% of the 24 h LC10 (53 mu g L-1) fipronil. Swimming performance was significantly impaired at 20% of the 24 h LC10 (0.14 mu g L-1) of bifenthrin and 10% of the 24 h LC10 of Talstare (0.03 mu g L-1). Fipronil and Termidor led to a significant impairment of swimming performance at 142 mu g L-1 and 148 mu g L-1 respectively, with more pronounced effects for the formulation. Our data shows that based on dissolved concentrations both formulations were more toxic than the pure active ingredients, suggesting that increased toxicity due to inert ingredients should be considered in risk assessments and regulation of insecticides.

The fungicide Pristine (R) and its active ingredients (25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) have been reported to have low acute toxicity to caged honey bee workers, but many sublethal effects at field-relevant doses have been reported and Pristine (R) was recently found to increase worker pollen consumption, reduce worker longevity and colony populations at field relevant concentrations (Fisher et al. 2021). To directly compare these whole-colony field results to more standard laboratory toxicology tests, the effects of Pristine (R), at a range of field-relevant concentrations, were assessed on the survival and pollen consumption of honey bee workers 0-14 days of age. Also, to separate the effects of the inert and two active ingredients, bees were fed pollen containing boscalid, pyraclostrobin, or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid, at concentrations matching those in the Pristine (R) treatments. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced pollen consumption across the duration of the experiment, and dose dependently reduced pollen consumption on days 12-14. Pristine (R) and boscalid significantly reduced pollen feeding rate on days 12-14. Boscalid reduced survival in a dose-dependent manner. Consumption of Pristine (R) or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid did not affect survival, providing evidence against strong negative effects of the inert ingredients in Pristine (R) and against negative synergistic effects of boscalid and pyraclostrobin. The stronger toxic effects of Pristine (R) observed in field colonies compared to this laboratory test, and the opposite responses of pollen consumption in the laboratory and field to Pristine (R), show that standard laboratory toxicology tests can fail to predict responses of pollinators to pesticides and to provide protection.",2021,"226",NA,NA,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112841","YES","NO","YES","n/a","tested many concentrations but range was very small.

Six pesticides commonly applied in apple orchards (Guthion(R) 50WP, Imidan(R) 50WP, Thiodan(R) 50WP, Dithane(R) DG, Nova(R) 40W, and Basudin(R) 500EC) and technical grade diazinon were also evaluated for direct toxicity to green frogs using continuous and discontinuous toxicity tests. Embryos and larvae exhibited poor hatching success and survival at some orchard sites during in situ assays, but no specific water source produced consistently poor developmental success. Reduced tadpole growth occurred at several study sites, showing no clear distinction between reference and orchard sites. Despite the collection of substantial environmental data, only surface water temperature appeared to be correlated with growth rates. Basudin 500EC, technical grade diazinon, and Dithane DG caused mortality, deformities, or growth inhibition during early development at environmentally relevant concentrations (<0.01 mg/L), whereas Imidan 50WP, Guthion 50WP, and Nova 40W produced survival or growth effects at much higher levels (5-10 mg/L). Dithane DG (mancozeb) was acutely toxic during prolonged exposures, and sublethal growth and deformity responses occurred at nominal concentrations greater than 0.01 mg/L.

The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50μm. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2μm with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (~200nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (λ-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (~250nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (~2200nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20μg a.i. L-1 technical λ-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped λ-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016,"86","68","74","10.1016/j.envint.2015.10.012","YES","NO","YES","DEVELOPMENT","No CIs reported.

For each compound we obtained original IC50 values, with consistent higher toxicities for formulated compounds compared to active ingredients alone. Mixtures of the four herbicides, prepared according to application doses encountered in agriculture, were found to be toxic at a lower concentration than single molecules. Mesotrione and nicosulfuron mixture appeared to be highly toxic to V. fischeri, however, this recommended post-emergence combination for maize crops got its toxicity decreased in formulated compound mixtures, suggesting that chemical interactions could potentially reduce the toxicity. Data comparisons to theoretical models showed a good prediction of mixture toxicity by Concentration Addition concept.

Information is also presented on dose-response relations and their use in hazard assessment, granule size and hazard, response patterns, and toxic signs. The general conclusions were: (1) The organophosphates (fenamiphos and fensulfothion) and the carbamate (aldicarb) were the most toxic of the insecticides tested. (2) The granular formulation and its technical grade active ingredient were of equivalent toxicity, or the granular was significantly less toxic.

Different formulations using the same active ingredient are frequently available, which raises the issue of potential influence of different formulation types on herbicide toxicity. The present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampe (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the way of active substance release. This investigation is the first report on zebrafish embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The technical active ingredient and formulations caused mortality and diverse teratogenic effects, showing different levels of toxicity. The LC50 values for the technical ingredient, Rampa (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS were 61.4, 9.6 and 92.5 mg a.i./l, respectively. Spontaneous movements in 22 hpf embryos decreased under exposure to both the technical ingredient and formulations. A significant number of underdeveloped embryos was detected after exposure to clomazone and Rampe EC, while no underdevelopment was noted in embryos exposed to GAT Cenit 36 CS. Exposure to the technical ingredient and formulations led also to a series of morphological changes and interfered with the growth of zebrafish embryos. The EC50 based on detection of edemas, spine and tail tip deformations and gas bladder absence (120 hpf) was 12.1, 10.1 and 24.1 mg/l for technical clomazone, Rampe EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, while teratogenicity index (TI) based on LC50/EC50 ratio was 5.1, 1 and 3.8, respectively.

Risk assessments are usually based on the pure active ingredient and not on the formulated products applied in the environment.

To investigate the effects of the different types of azoxystrobin, E. albidus was exposed to the pure active ingredient, AZO_AI, and the formulated product, AZO_FP. Survival, reproduction, and molecular biomarkers of E. albidus were determined for different exposure durations (seven and 21 days). AZO_FP (LC50 = 15.3 mg(a.i.)/kg) showed a slightly stronger effect on survival than AZO_AI (LC50 = 16.8 mg(a.i.)/kg), yet the impact on reproduction was much stronger. Namely, while the tested concentrations of AZO_AI (EC50 >= 8 mg(a.i.)/kg) had almost no effect on reproduction, AZO_FP (EC50 = 2.9 mg(a.i.)/kg) significantly inhibited reproduction in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase) and malondialdehyde levels in both treatments indicated oxidative stress. Although AZO_FP had a stronger negative effect, the impact depended on the exposure time and the tested concentration. The higher toxicity of AZO_FP was a consequence of increased bioavailability and activity of the active ingredient due to the presence of adjuvants. Overall stronger adverse effects of AZO_FP suggest that the toxicity of azoxystrobin in the agricultural environment on the enchytraeid population may be underestimated.

In a 96-h acute toxicity test we exposed Rana dalmatina and Bufo bufo tadpoles to either one of three concentrations of glyphosate, three concentrations of the surfactant (POEA), three concentrations of the two components together, or to non-contaminated water (control), and subsequently assessed mortality and body mass. To investigate whether simultaneous exposure to another stress factor influences effects of the contaminants, we performed tests both in the presence or absence of predator chemical cues. We found that the surfactant had significant harmful effects on tadpoles; survival was lowered by the highest concentration of the surfactant in case of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo tadpoles it reduced survival already at medium concentrations. Body mass was significantly influenced by medium and high surfactant concentrations in both species. The presence of glyphosate did not have a significant effect by itself, but it slightly increased mortality in tadpoles exposed to medium concentrations of the surfactant in both species. The presence of chemical cues did not have an effect on the examined variables. Our study confirms that the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides is mainly due to the examined surfactant. Nonetheless, we found that glyphosate can enhance the harmful effect of the surfactant. These results stress that during the authorization process of new pesticide formulations, not only the active ingredients would need to be examined but the excipients should also be taken into account in an obligatory and systematic manner.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-023-02626-x","YES","NO","YES","GROWTH","expressed everything in terms of POEA.

Fenvalerate and esfenvalerate were both highly toxic to larval rainbow fish with 1-h esfenvalerate pulse-exposure concentrations as low as 0.32 μg l-1, and 1-min fenvalerate pulse-exposure concentrations of 4.5 μg l-1, sufficient to cause significant mortality. Technical grades were significantly more toxic than emulsified grades of the pesticides. The 1-h pulse-exposure 96-h LC50's were 12.75, 30.25, 1.18, and 1.99 μg l-1 for technical fenvalerate, emulsified fenvalerate, technical esfenvalerate, and emulsified esfenvalerate, respectively. Emulsified fenvalerate and esfenvalerate were also extremely toxic to adult crimson-spotted rainbow fish. The 96-h continuous exposure LC50's for adult fish using 50% daily partial replacement were 14.58 and 6.24 μg l-1, respectively, comparable with results for holarctic species. Fenvalerate is a racemic mixture containing four optical isomers (2R, aR; 2R, aS; 2S, aR, 2S, aS), while esfenvalerate contains mainly the 2S isomers. Esfenvalerate contains approximately twice the quantity of 2S isomers as does fenvalerate on a weight basis. Pulse-exposure LC50's for esfenvalerate were 10 to 15 times lower than for fenvalerate, a much higher toxicity of esfenvalerate than the roughly two fold difference which would have been predicted solely on a weight basis. Thus the 2R isomers, which make up approximately 50% of the fenvalerate formulation and which previously were regarded as non-active, appear to have reduced the expected toxicity of fenvalerate relative to measured esfenvalerate toxicity, perhaps via the inhibition of sodium channel activation. There was a complex relationship between pesticide concentration and time to mortality. At low concentrations of pesticide, most mortality occurred within the first 24 h, while at higher concentrations, mortality continued for 96 h after exposure. This suggests that mortality within the first 24 h was due to direct physiological effects of the pesticide on the larvae, while subsequent mortality was primarily due to starvation of larvae unable to recover from the initial insult. Duration of exposure (0 to 120 min) to emulsified fenvalerate and esfenvalerate significantly affected the acute toxicity to larval rainbow fish. For esfenvalerate, there was a linear relationship between duration of exposure and acute toxicity, while for fenvalerate, exposures of longer than 20 min did not significantly increase 96-h mortality. © 1994.",1994,"28","169","187","10.1016/0166-445X(94)90032-9","YES","YES","NO","n/a","n/a"

Acute toxicities for Roundup ranged from 2.3 mg/L (96-h LC50, fathead minnow) to 43 mg/L (48-h EC50, mature scuds). Toxicities of the surfactant were similar to those of the Roundup formulation. Technical glyphosate was considerably less toxic than Roundup or the surfactant; for midge larvae, the 48-h EC50 was 55 mg/L and for rainbow trout, the 96-h LC50 was 140 mg/L. Roundup was more toxic to rainbow trout and bluegills at the higher test temperatures, and at pH 7.5 than at pH 6.5. Toxicity did not increase at pH 8.5 or 9.5. Eyed eggs were the least sensitive life stage, but toxicity increased markedly as the fish entered the sac fry and early swim-up stages. No changes in fecundity or gonadosomatic index were observed in adult rainbow trout treated with the isopropylamine salt or Roundup up to 2.0 mg/L. The aging of Roundup test solutions for seven days did not reduce toxicity to midge larvae, rainbow trout or bluegills. In avoidance studies, rainbow trout did not avoid concentrations of the isopropylamine salt up to 10.0 mg/L; mayfly nymphs avoided 10.0 mg/L of Roundup, but not 1.0 mg/L. In a simulated field application, midge larvae avoided 2.0 mg/L of Roundup. Application of Roundup, at recommended rates, along ditchbank areas of irrigation canals should not adversely affect resident populations of fish or invertebrates. However, spring applications in lentic situations, where dissolved oxygen levels are low or temperatures are elevated, could be hazardous to young-of-the-year-fishes. © 1979 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",1979,"8","269","278","10.1007/BF01056243","YES","YES","NO","FECUNDITY","n/a"

Two types of tests were conducted for each of the resmethrin formulations using adult and larval grass shrimp life stages, a 96-h static renewal aqueous test without sediment, and a 24-h static nonrenewal aqueous test with sediment. For resmethrin, the 96-h aqueous LC50 value for adult shrimp was 0.53 mu g/L (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.60 mu g/L), and for larval shrimp was 0.35 mu g/L (95% CI: 0.28-0.42 mu g/L). In the presence of sediment, technical resmethrin produced a 24-h LC50 value for adult shrimp of 5.44 mu g/L (95% CI: 4.52-6.55 mu g/L), and for larval shrimp of 2.15 mu g/L (95% CI: 1.35-3.43 mu g/L). For Scourge((R)), the 96-h aqueous LC50 for adult shrimp was 2.08 mg/L (95% CI: 1.70-2.54 mu g/L), and for larval shrimp was 0.36 mu g/L (95% CI: 0.24-0.55 mu g/L).

The aim of this study was to assess the effects, separately, of the formulation Verosil(R), the formulation additives, and technical-grade imazethapyr, in the acidic form or as ammonium salt, on the microalga Scenedesmus vacuolatus (Chlorophyta). Verosil(R), formulation additives, and acid imazethapyr significantly inhibited the growth of S. vacuolatus (Verosil(R) > formulation additives > acid imazethapyr) and caused morphological alterations from 2 mg L-1, 4 mg L-1, and 60 mg L-1 onwards, respectively. Verosil(R) and formulation additives caused the most adverse effect including membrane disorganization, cytoplasm contraction, cell wall thickening, thylakoidal membrane disaggregation, and starch granule accumulation. In addition, Verosil(R) and formulation additives increased the chl a/chl b ratio, indicating possible alterations in photosystems as a stress response. The carotene/chl a ratio was also increased in microalgae exposed to both Verosil(R) and formulation additives, suggesting an antioxidant response to these toxic compounds.

The objective of this study was to compare the sorption/desorption, biodegradation and toxic effects of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulation (Ectomort Centenary) of the organophosphate insecticide propetamphos in river and estuarine sediments. For both formulations, the sorption of propetamphos onto sediment was initially very rapid followed by a slower sorption phase. Similarly, the initial rate of desorption was rapid, followed by a much slower rate. In both sorption and desorption experiments, the level of sorbed propetamphos was considerably higher for the commercial formulation of propetamphos (K-d = 7-11) than for the Pestanal (R) grade (K-d = 4-10). The rate of propetamphos biodegradation was sediment dependent but was most rapid where microbial activity and nutrients were the highest and sorption was the lowest. Propetamphos was more rapidly degraded in sediments under aerobic (t(1/2)=15 d) compared to anaerobic conditions (t(1/2) = 19 d). However, no significant difference in the biodegradation rates of the Pestanal (R) grade and commercial formulations of propetamphos were observed. The toxic effect of propetamphos on sediment microbial communities was significantly greater for the commercial formulation than for the Pestanal (R) grade of propetamphos based on EC50 (21 versus 236 mu g g(-1)) and EC10 values (0.3 versus 54 mu g g(-1)). In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of using commercial pesticide formulations when carrying out ecotoxicological testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Yet little is known about ecotoxicological effects on non-target benthic freshwater species exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IMI and its marketed products. The aim of the present study was to narrow this gap by assessing effects of pure IMI and its commercial formulation Confidor (R) on the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, a key species in freshwater sediments. To this end, we determined dose-response relationships in 24 h toxicity tests, bioconcentration during 24 h and 5 d of exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g IMI L-1, and physiological stress responses by measuring glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase activity in the same conditions. Maximum neonicotinoid concentrations reported from the field were lethal to L. variegatus within 24 h (LC50 of 65 and 88 mu g IMI L-1 in pure form and as active ingredient of Confidor (R), respectively). At sub-lethal exposure concentrations, tissue content of IMI significantly increased with exposure time. The observed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were far above the water octanol coefficient (K-OW), indicating a potentially large underestimation of IMI bioaccumulation when based on K-OW. Activities of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes indicated attempts of L. variegatus to counter xenobiotic-triggered oxidative stress to very low IMI and Confidor (R) concentrations. Together, our data add significantly to growing evidence that the continued proliferation of neonicotinoids require increased efforts in environmental risk assessment, especially in view of species-specific differences in sensitivities to the insecticide and possibly to additives of commercial formulations.

In order to better understand the toxicity results obtained in field conditions, particularly the influence of the pesticide formulations in the toxic effects, laboratory studies were performed using water samples fortified with the active ingredient and the respective formulated product (commercial product) of some pesticides (molinate, MCPA, propanil, endosulfan, chlorfenvinphos) usually applied in Portuguese paddies. The range of concentrations tested reflects the rates used by the farmers in real field conditions. The toxicity values observed in the laboratory during 1998 with the microbiotests Daphtoxkit magna F(TM), Thamnotoxkit F(TM), Artoxkit M(TM) and Algaltoxkit F(TM) are presented and discussed in this study. The results obtained until now suggest that organic solvents and surfactants present in some of the tested formulations may affect the toxicity of the sample, In fact, water samples fortified with formulated pesticides seemed to be, in the majority of the cases, more toxic than the respective active ingredients solutions, particularly in the case of the three tested crustaceans. The microbiotests used seem to be a useful tool to evaluate toxicity with relative low cost, rapidity, and simplicity, compared with the traditional tests.

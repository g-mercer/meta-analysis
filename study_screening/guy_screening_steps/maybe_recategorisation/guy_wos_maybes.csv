Due to its widespread use around the world, relatively high concentrations of glyphosate have been detected in soil and aquatic environments. The presence of glyphosate in aquatic ecosystems has aroused the attention of researchers because of its potential negative effects on living organisms, both animals and plants. In this context, this review intends to summarize results of studies aimed at evaluating the effects of glyphosate (both as active ingredient and component of commercial formulations) on marine invertebrates. Generally, data obtained in acute toxicity tests indicate that glyphosate and its commercial formulations are lethal at high concentrations (not environmentally realistic), whereas results of long-lasting experiments indicate that glyphosate can markedly affect biological responses of marine invertebrates. Consequently, more efforts should be addressed at evaluating chronic or sub-chronic effects of such substances to marine invertebrate species.",2020,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse8060399

Laboratory scale experiments were carried out to treat solutions of the pure active ingredient and the commercial formulation employing a solar simulator as irradiation source. Degradation of the active ingredient followed in all cases a pseudo-first-order kinetic and rate constants, k, indicated that reaction was faster when the thiophosphate moiety was present. Additives existing in the commercial formulations resulted in an important decrease in the reaction rate, as k values were at least 50% lower than those obtained with the corresponding pure active principle (0.013 min(-1) for Ultracid and 0.033 min(-1) for methidathion, 0.011 min(-1) for Laition and 0.026 min(-1) for dimethoate, and 0.007 min(-1) for Sevnol and 0.016 min(-1) for carbaryl). Important increase in the surface tension was measured in all cases, indicating that the photocatalytic treatment is able to remove the surface active species present in the commercial formulation. Finally, assays based on the inhibition of the respiration of activated sludge indicated a decrease in the toxicity of all four commercial mixtures from initial values in the range 40-80% to achieve complete detoxification when the elimination of the active ingredient is reached.",2008,130,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.2969810

The method involved batch incubation of soils suspended with a commercial copper oxychloride-metalaxyl-based fungicide in 0.01 M CaCl2. Afterwards, the metalaxyl concentration remaining in solution was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The amount of dissolved metalaxyl in the fungicide suspension depends mainly on the soil pH, its potential acidity, and the cation exchange capacity. Of the approx. 20% metalaxyl retained by the solid colloids, the effect of organic matter colloids in soils (15-20 mg kg(-1)) had a poor contribution (six times lower) than the copper oxychloride colloids (40%, w/w)in the commercial fungicide formulation (100-130 mg kg(-1)). When comparing these retention data with the behaviour of metalaxyl used as a technical grade fungicide of about 100% purity (10-15 mg kg(-1) in solids), it is clear that the commercial formulation increases a 30% retention of metalaxyl by soil (15-20 mg kg(-1) in solids). The overall effect of the metalaxyl formulation plus soil show values of 10 times higher retention than technical grade-metalaxyl plus soil. Commercial formulation can decrease the mobility of soluble metalaxyl in agricultural soils with regard to the expected values obtained from batch studies using analytical grade-metalaxyl. Therefore, the effect of surfactants should be considered in the assessment of water contamination by the pesticides used in agriculture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

wos129,Guy,NO,"Mesnage, R; Antoniou, MN",Ignoring Adjuvant Toxicity Falsifies the Safety Profile of Commercial Pesticides,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,"Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal active principle and other ingredients, with the latter collectively also known as adjuvants. These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments.",2018,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00361

Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide and was considered to be non-toxic. But its use in excess in agricultural lands has polluted soils and waters. Nowadays, glyphosate residues are found in soil, water and food. As a result glyphosate causes severe acute and chronic toxicological effects. We review toxicological effects of glyphosate and metabolites on organisms of the kingdom animalia, both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Adverse effects on unicellular organisms have been established in many experiments. For instance, glyphosate has reduced the rate of photosynthesis in Euglena, has decreased the radial growth of mycorrhizal fungal species and is also reducing the profusion of certain bacteria present in rhizospheric microbial communities. Glyphosate poses serious threat to multicellular organisms as well. Its toxicological effects have been traced from lower invertebrates to higher vertebrates. Effects have been observed in annelids (earthworms), arthropods (crustaceans and insects), mollusks, echinoderms, fish, reptiles, amphibians and birds. Toxicological effects like genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, nuclear aberration, hormonal disruption, chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage have also been observed in higher vertebrates like humans.",2018,16,401,426,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10311-017-0689-0

Adjuvant-herbicide interactions are reviewed with particular reference to the benefits, including dose reduction, enhanced and more consistent herbicide activity, and the nature of underlying mechanisms; the use and role of surfactants receive particular attention. Surfactants are used as activators in commercial formulations of many herbicides to improve their foliar absorption and ultimate biological activity. Current views on their influence are considered in relation to surface phenomena, solubilisation of non-polar active ingredients, wax dissolution, cuticle penetration, preferential sites of penetration, membrane permeability and possible systemicity. The importance of a number of moderating factors (plant, chemical and environmental) is discussed in the light of current work, with particular regard to herbicide polarity, surfactant type, Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance and critical micelle concentration.

The widespread use of synthetic pesticides has led to concerns regarding their environmental fate and their effects on pollinators. Based on a standardised review, we report the use of a wide variety of honey bee matrices and sampling methods in the scientific papers studying pesticide exposure. Matrices such as beeswax and beebread were very little analysed despite their capacities for long-term pesticide storage. Moreover, bioavailability and transfer between in-hive matrices were poorly understood and explored. Many pesticides were studied but interactions between molecules or with other stressors were lacking. Sampling methods, targeted matrices and units of measure should have been, to some extent, standardised between publications to ease comparison and cross checking. Data on honey bee exposure to pesticides would have also benefit from the use of commercial formulations in experiments instead of active ingredients, with a special assessment of co-formulants (quantitative exposure and effects). Finally, the air matrix within the colony must be explored in order to complete current knowledge on honey bee pesticide exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous results (mostly published in the years 2010-2013) concerning the action of glyphosate and its formulations in the recent decade were analyzed. Initial reports about alleged biodegradability of glyphosate in the environment turned out to be wrong. It has been shown that glyphosate remains in the soil and can reach people by spreading along with groundwater. Recent publications have shown that glyphosate is detected at low concentrations in the human blood. Publications cited in this article, which indicate a possible induction of neoplastic changes by glyphosate formulation, have raised great concern and controversy in the scientific world. Presenting adverse effects of glyphosate and its formulations we focused on the role of glyphosate formulations in hormonal disorders by impeding the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and the inhibition of aromatase activity. The impact of glyphosate on oxygen reactive species formation, changes in redox system and the effect on necrosis and apoptosis in various types of cells was shown. We also revealed that glyphosate as a phosphonate herbicide does not inhibit directly the activity of acetylcholinesterase. Based on numerous studies it was noted that commercial formulations of glyphosate exhibit higher toxicity than that of the active substance itself.

wos257,Guy,NO,"Bruce, AB; Borlu, Y; Glenna, LL",Assessing the scientific support for U.S. EPA pesticide regulatory policy governing active and inert ingredients,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES,"US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide regulatory policy only requires environmental impact and safety testing and labeling of the active ingredients of pesticide products, rather than the end use formula. This policy is thought to partially explain the conflicting outcomes of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and EPA assessments on glyphosate, and there is substantial scientific evidence that this approach has led to an underestimation of risk. In this paper, we present a review of EPA pesticide policy governing the regulation of active and other ingredients and findings from a survey of US agricultural scientists focused on their views of this EPA policy. The survey findings indicate that the scientists we surveyed support a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of pesticide products, including both active and inert ingredients, as well as the end use product, to test for combined effects. They also support the disclosure and labeling of inert ingredients to support independent testing of these chemicals. The results also indicate that university scientists oriented towards public science are more likely to support regulation than university scientists oriented towards private science. Overall, despite substantial evidence that the combination of all ingredients in pesticide products may be more toxic than the active ingredients alone, the current regulatory approach does not provide a pathway for the agency to respond to this science. In this sense, the scientific support for the agency's current regulatory approach is unclear.",2023,13,1,13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13412-022-00788-4
wos266,Guy,NO,"Giglio, A; Vommaro, ML",Dinitroaniline herbicides: a comprehensive review of toxicity and side effects on animal non-target organisms,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"The widespread use of herbicides has increased concern about the hazards and risks to animals living in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A comprehensive understanding of their effective action at different levels of biological organization is critical for establishing guidelines to protect ecosystems and human health. Dinitroanilines are broad-spectrum pre-emergence herbicides currently used for weed control in the conventional agriculture. They are considered extremely safe agrochemicals because they act specifically on tubulin proteins and inhibit shoot and root growth of plants. However, there is a lack of toxicity information regarding the potential risk of exposure to non-target organisms. The aim of the present review is to focus on side effects of the most commonly used active ingredients, e.g. pendimethalin, oryzalin, trifluralin and benfluralin, on animal non-target cells of invertebrates and vertebrates. Acute toxicity varies from slightly to high in terrestrial and aquatic species (i.e. nematodes, earthworms, snails, insects, crustaceans, fish and mammals) depending on the species-specific ability of tested organisms to adsorb and discharge toxicants. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and activation of oxidative stress pathways as well as alterations of physiological, metabolic, morphological, developmental and behavioural traits, reviewed here, indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of active ingredients poses a clear hazard to animals and humans. Further research is required to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of action of these herbicides in the animal cell and on biological functions at multiple levels, from organisms to communities, including the effects of commercial formulations.",2022,29,76687,76711,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23169-4
wos269,Guy,NO,"Tominack, RL",Herbicide formulations,JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY-CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY,"Background: Herbicides comprise nearly half of the 5 billion pounds of pesticide active ingredients used worldwide annually. The active ingredient must be formulated with other ingredients to allow mixing, dilution, application, and stability. Liquid commercial formulations for spray foliar application include water-soluble liquids, emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates or flowables, and gels. Dry formulations that are mixed with water for spray application include wettable powders and water-dispersible granules. Granules are broadcast directly out of the bag. The carrier in liquid formulations is either water or an organic solvent or oil. The general chemical class of the carrier may be deduced based on the solubility characteristics of the active ingredient. Cosolvents may be necessary to optimize solubility and stability. Surfactants are nearly universally present in herbicide formulations or added prior to application. They aid uniform spreading of the spray droplet on the leaf and penetration of its waxy cuticle by the active ingredient. In solvent-based formulations, surfactants permit a stable oil-in-water emulsion to form when diluted with water for actual use. New surfactant systems are currently of intense competitive importance. Other formulation ingredients include pH adjusters, buffers, milling aids, antifoaming agents, acid scavengers, dyes, suspending agents, preservatives, dispersants, emulsifiers, densifiers, antifreeze, and crystal promoters. In highly regulated environments, the other formulation components in pesticides are receiving scrutiny. In the US, the EPA's strategy has been to categorize currently used formulation ingredients into 4 lists based on their toxicology profiles. The ultimate outcome is to have all inert ingredients on List 4, Minimal Risk. List 4 ingredients are generally regarded as safe or Rave current use patterns that do not pose an unreasonable risk of adverse effect to public health or the environment.",2000,38,129,135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CLT-100100927

Although the need for the assessment of health and environmental hazards deriving from the interactions between various substances found in commercial pesticide formulations is becoming increasingly recognized, the approval of pesticide products is still mostly limited to determining the toxicity of the individual ingredients ignoring the possible combined effects in mixtures. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature of in vitro and in vivo studies that simultaneously examine the toxicity of pesticide product formulations and their declared active ingredients to compare their toxicity to human health and to the environment. Two electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed the health effects of active pesticide ingredients and their product formulations. The literature search was performed with a combination of the following terms: pesticide, formulation, commercial product, commercial pesticide and health. After screening by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and reliability assessment of eligible publications was conducted by use of the ToxRTool. Two investigators independently screened the identified publications and extracted results from eligible studies. Our search yielded 36 toxicity studies; 23 studies investigated herbicides, 15 examined insecticides and 4 focused on fungicides. Twenty-four studies reported increased toxicity of the product formulations versus their active ingredients, which, in most cases, were attributed to the presence of adjuvants in the formulations. A significant number (n = 10) of studies focused on the comparative testing of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, and six of them concluded that Roundup, the dominant product formulation of glyphosate, is more toxic than the active ingredient alone. We identified only 8 studies demonstrating reduced toxicity of product formulations in relation to the active ingredient that might be due to a potential antagonistic effect between the constituents. The results of this review demonstrate the inadequacy of current EU testing requirements for assessing the health hazards of pesticide product formulations based mainly on the evaluation of the individual ingredients and of at least one representative use and formulation. Ignoring the possible risks deriving from the interaction between the active and other ingredients of various commercial pesticide product formulations might result in the misinterpretation of its toxicological profile. At EU level efforts are currently made to address this issue. In this context, we recommend that all product formulations should be fully assessed during the authorization process.",2020,181,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108926
wos332,Guy,NO,"Bencko, V; Foong, FYL",The history of arsenical pesticides and health risks related to the use of Agent Blue,ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE,"Arsenicals in agriculture. Beginning in the 1970s, the use of arsenic compounds for such purposes as wood preservatives, began to grow. By 1980, in the USA, 70% of arsenic had been consumed for the production of wood preservatives. This practice was later stopped, due to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ban of the arsenic-and chromium-based wood preservative chromated copper arsenate. In the past, arsenical herbicides containing cacodylic acid as an active ingredient have been used extensively in the USA, from golf courses to cotton fields, and drying-out the plants before harvesting. The original commercial form of Agent Blue was among 10 toxic insecticides, fungicides and herbicides partially deregulated by the US EPA in February 2004, and specific limits on toxic residues in meat, milk, poultry and eggs, were removed. Today, however, they are no longer used as weed-killers, with one exception - monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA), a broadleaf weed herbicide for use on cotton. Severe poisonings from cacodylic acid caused headache, dizziness, vomiting, profuse and watery diarrhea, followed by dehydration, gradual fall in blood pressure, stupor, convulsions, general paralysis and possible risk of death within 3-14 days. The relatively frequent use of arsenic and its compounds in both industry and agriculture points to a wide spectrum of opportunities for human exposure. This exposure can be via inhalation of airborne arsenic, contaminated drinking water, beverages, or from food and drugs. Today, acute organic arsenical poisonings are mostly accidental. Considerable concern has developed surrounding its delayed effects, for its genotoxic and carcinogenic potential, which has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies and subsequent animal experiments. Conclusions. There is substantial epidemiological evidence for an excessive risk, mostly for skin and lung cancer, among humans exposed to organic arsenicals in occupational and environmental settings. Furthermore, the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects have only been observed at relatively high exposure rates. Current epidemiological and experimental studies are attempting to elucidate the mechanism of this action, pointing to the question whether arsenic is actually a true genotoxic, or rather an epigenetic carcinogen. Due to the complexity of its effects, both options remain plausible. Its interactions with other toxic substances still represent another important field of interest.",2017,24,312,316,http://dx.doi.org/10.26444/aaem/74715

Rising incidence, increased risk among migrants to higher risk regions, and poor prediction of individual risk have prompted a search for additional modifiable factors. Risk factors for breast cancer include reproductive characteristics associated with estrogen and other hormones, pharmaceutical hormones, and activities such as alcohol use and lack of exercise that affect hormone levels. As a result, investigation of hormonally active compounds in commercial products and pollution is a priority. Compounds that cause mammary tumors in animals are additional priorities. Animal models provide insight into possible mechanisms for effects of environmental pollutants on breast cancer and identify chemical exposures to target in epidemiologic studies. Although few epidemiologic studies have been conducted for chemical exposures, occupational studies show associations between breast cancer and exposure to certain organic solvents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Population-based studies have been limited to a few organochlorine compounds and PAHs and have been mostly negative. A variety of challenges in studies of breast cancer and the environment may have contributed to negative findings. Lack of exposure assessment tools and few hypothesis-generating toxicologic studies limit the scope of epidemiologic studies. Issues of timing with respect to latency and periods of breast vulnerability, and individual differences in susceptibility pose other challenges. Substantial work is needed in exposure assessment, toxicology, and susceptibility before we can expect a pay-off from large epidemiologic studies of breast cancer and environment.",2003,111,1007,1019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.6310

The most essential key to resolving these dilemmas may be to understand the mechanism of actions (i.e., a possible low-dose issue).

The introduction of halogens into active ingredients has become an important concept in the quest for a modern agrochemical with optimal efficacy, environmental safety, user friendliness and economic viability. Outstanding progress has been made, especially in synthetic methods for particular halogen-substituted key intermediates that were previously prohibitively expensive. Interestingly, there has been a rise in the number of commercial products containing 'mixed' halogens, e.g. one or more fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms in addition to one or more further halogen atoms. Extrapolation of the current trend indicates that a definite growth is to be expected in fluorine-substituted agrochemicals throughout the twenty-first century. A number of these recently developed agrochemical candidates containing halogen substituents represent novel classes of chemical compounds with new modes of action. However, the complex structure-activity relationships associated with biologically active molecules mean that the introduction of halogens can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the efficacy of a compound, depending on its changed mode of action, physicochemical properties, target interaction or metabolic susceptibility and transformation. In spite of modern design concepts, it is still difficult to predict the sites in a molecule at which halogen substitution will result in optimal desired effects.

Natural products have been researched as a control, and an alternative to these synthetic fungicides since they are not harmful to health and contribute to the environment caring.

Despite their name, inert ingredients may be biologically or chemically active and are labeled inert only because of their function in the formulated product. Most of the tests required to register a pesticide are performed with the active ingredient alone, not the fall pesticide formulation. Inert ingredients are generally not identified on product labels and are often claimed to be confidential business information. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary, we describe the shortcomings of the current procedures for assessing the hazards of pesticide formulations and demonstrate that inert ingredients can increase the toxicity of and potential exposure to pesticide formulations. DISCUSSION: Inert ingredients can increase the ability of pesticide formulations to affect significant toxicologic end points, including developmental neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, and disruption of hormone function. They can also increase exposure by increasing dermal absorption, decreasing the efficacy of protective clothing, and increasing environmental mobility and persistence. Inert ingredients can increase the phytotoxicity of pesticide formulations as well as the toxicity to Fish, amphibians, and microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Pesticide registration should require fall assessment of formulations. Evaluations of pesticides under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and similar statutes should include impact assessment of formulations. Environmental monitoring for pesticides should include inert ingredients. To enable independent research and risk assessment, inert ingredients should be identified on product labels.",2006,114,1803,1806,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.9374

Strategies are sought to reduce the toxicity of this fungicide and alternative treatments are welcome. An alternative could be the use of clove oil, which has Eugenol as its major compound, and has antifungal potential against G. cingulata, however, Eugenol is susceptible to degradation processes which may compromise its efficacy. The nanoencapsulation of Mancozeb and Eugenol is a possible strategy to overcome the limitations of toxicity, solubility and instability of these compounds. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop nanoemulsions containing Mancozeb (0.1 mg/mL) and Eugenol (33 mg/mL), isolated or associated, and evaluate the safety of these formulations through cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and ecotoxicity tests. Nanoemulsions were developed by the spontaneous emulsification method, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in healthy human cells through MTT, Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and Picogreen tests, and ecotoxicity assessment was carried out using the chronic toxicity test in springtails. After preparation, the physicochemical characterization of the nanoemulsions were performed which presented mean particle size between 200 and 300 nm, polydispersity index less than 0.3, negative zeta potential and acid pH. The nanoencapsulation was able to avoid the reduction of the cell viability caused by Mancozeb, while Eugenol was shown to be safe for cell use in both free and nanostructured forms, however the association of the two active compounds showed toxicity in the higher doses of Mancozeb. In the ecotoxicity tests, both free Mancozeb and Eugenol forms presented high toxic potential for soil, whereas the nanoencapsulation of these compounds did not cause a reduction in number of springtails.

The search for alternative insect pest control is becoming increasingly important and is including the use of plant-derived pesticides. Plant-derived pesticides are reported as effective in controlling various insect pests through natural mechanisms, with biodegradable organic materials, diverse bioactivity, and low toxicity to non-target organisms. An antifeedant approach for insect control in crop management has been comprehensively studied by many researchers, though it has only been restricted to plantbased compounds and to the laboratory level at least. Nano-delivery formulations of biopesticides offer a wide variety of benefits, including increased effectiveness and efficiency (well-dispersion, wettability, and target delivery) with the improved properties of the antifeedant. This review paper evaluates the role of the nano-delivery system in antifeedant obtained from various plant extracts. The evaluation includes the research progress of antifeedant-based nano-delivery systems and the bioactivity performances of different types of nano-carrier formulations against various insect pests. An antifeedant nano-delivery system can increase their bioactivities, such as increasing sublethal bioactivity or reducing toxicity levels in both crude extracts/essential oils (EOs) and pure compounds. However, the plant-based antifeedant requires nanotechnological development to improve the nanodelivery systems regarding properties related to the bioactive functionality and the target site of insect pests.

Most research into the effects of agrochemicals focusses on the effects of active ingredients. This reflects the assumption that 'inert' ingredients are non-toxic. A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used. We argue that 'inert' ingredients have distinct, and poorly understood, ecological persistency profiles and toxicities, making research into their individual effects necessary. We highlight the lack of mitigation in place to protect bees from 'inert' ingredients and argue that research efforts should be redistributed to address the knowledge gap identified here.

The environmental risk assessment for such commercial mixtures applies as default the concept of concentration addition. There is remaining regulatory concern, however, that underestimation of risks can occur if components in the mixture interact synergistically, i.e., elicit effects greater than those predicted by concentration addition. While cases of true synergism appear to be rare, the combination of substances targeting different steps in the same biosynthesis pathway was pointed out as one potential case of synergistic interaction although mechanistic explanations are lacking. The present study aimed to verify this hypothesis using the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata as the regulatory standard test organism for which such synergism had been indicated earlier. Algal growth inhibition tests were conducted with mixtures of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors (tebuconazole, fenpropidin, and fenpropimorph). The fungicides were first tested individually to derive reliable data for a mixture toxicity prediction. The here determined toxicity estimates for two of the fungicides were considerably lower than the endpoints in the regulatory dossiers, which had been used for earlier mixture toxicity predictions. Experimentally observed toxicity estimates for the mixtures deviated <2.6-fold from the predicted values. Hence, the hypothesis of synergistic interaction between fungicides targeting different enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis was clearly not confirmed for the green alga R. subcapitata.

Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These 'inerts' overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated.

To account for potential mixture effects and improve PPP data requirements for application in risk assessment, a tiered test strategy is proposed. The strategy is based on a comparison of PPP and active substance toxicity, which enables the prioritisation of PPPs for further testing, adaptation of the toxicological threshold value or removal of toxic co-formulants from the PPP. Moreover, it focuses on the integrative assessment of existing information and newly generated data using alternative test methods. The proposed strategy will improve PPP toxicological assessment by accounting for mixture toxicity, providing a set of regulatory options for risk assessment and the necessary data for hazard assessment.

According to the environmental impact approach, adjuvants are defined as green (1) if they have a low human and environmental impact, (2) if they do not increase active ingredient environmental mobility and/or toxicity to humans and non-target organisms, (3) if they do not increase the exposure to these active substances and (4) if they lower the impact of formulated pesticides by enhancing the performance of active ingredients, thus potentially lowering the required dosage of active ingredients.

Three steps are essential for ensuring the safety of commercial technical-grade pesticide products, whether produced by the original manufacturer or by generic manufacturers. First, the identity and chemical structure of the impurities must be elucidated. This should include positive identification of major (greater than or equal to1%) and all toxicologically or environmentally relevant impurities, and characterization of minor impurities (greater than or equal to0.1%). Second, in addition to recognition of a minimum active ingredient content, official specifications should also list relevant impurities and their maximum permissible concentrations.

Even though PPPs contain considerable amounts of co-formulants, regulation and monitoring of residues normally focus on the active substances (a.s.) only. For our study we selected four commonly used co-formulants (three anionic surfactants and one organic solvent) and investigated the formation and decline of residues in vegetables and apples under field conditions. The aims were to characterize the behavior of co-formulant residues on crops and to provide a basis for future investigations on consumer exposure. RESULTS The development of robust and sensitive analytical methods allowed the quantification of residues in the low mu g/kg-level. After treatment with PPPs, co-formulants were detected up to approximately 10 mg kg(-1) in vegetables. In general, these residues declined fast with half-lives of a few days. Wash-off and volatilization were identified as important removal processes for anionic surfactants and the organic solvent, respectively. However, in specific crops (parsley and celery), organic solvent residues were still considerable (approximate to 2 mg kg(-1)) 2 weeks after treatment. We further demonstrate that it is feasible to estimate co-formulant residues using publicly available data on pesticide a.s.

In addition, the micromorphology and chemical properties of the exposed surfaces equally play a significant role. Traditional approaches to reduce rain-induced wash-off focus on the use of adjuvants either to raise the penetration rate of systemic and loco-systemic formulations, or to increase adhesion of active ingredients to the target surfaces.

The implementation of this policy has lea-to changes in the types of substances proposed for use as inert ingredients as well as advancements in the methods for reviewing new inert ingredients.

Shortly before the announcement of the conflicting views regarding the carcinogenicity status of this regulated agrochemical by EU Agencies, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the one hand, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on the other hand, the Cancer Assessment Review Committee of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) also published re-evaluations. The US EPA assessment classified glyphosate into Group E, not likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Similar positions were reached by EFSA and ECHA, assessing glyphosate as unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and not classified as a carcinogen, respectively. A strongly opposing evaluation has previously been reached by IARC by classifying glyphosate into Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. IARC identified potential cancer hazards in this case, but did not estimate the level of risk it may present, which was taken into consideration by opposing agencies. Multiple effects of glyphosate have been reported, of which carcinogenic effects are only one component. Formulated glyphosate products-especially with polyethoxylated tallowamine and related compounds-have been shown to cause stronger cytotoxic or endocrine disrupting effects than the active ingredient glyphosate alone. Questions related to hazards and corresponding risks identified in relation to this active ingredient and its formulated herbicide preparations divide scientific circles and official health and environmental authorities and organizations, and touch upon fundamental aspects of risk assessment and product regulation. The decision has to consider both hazard-based (IARC) and risk-based analysis (EFSA); the former may not be suitable to calculate practical significances, and the latter being challenged if exposure estimations are uncertain in light of new data on residue levels. The results of current analytical surveys on surface water are particularly worrisome.

Product approval is governed differently in these two sectors in the European Union (EU), and the occurrence of veterinary drug (VD) and pesticide residues indicated by contamination notification cases in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the EU also show characteristic differences. While the initial high numbers of VD residues reported in 2002 were successfully suppressed to less than 100 cases annually by 2006 and on, the number of notification cases for pesticide residues showed a gradual increase from a low (approximately 50 cases annually) initial level until 2005 to more than 250 cases annually after 2009, with a halt occurring only in 2016.

Lack of disclosure of adjuvant and formulation ingredients coupled with a lack of adequate analytical methods constrains the assessment of total chemical load on beneficial organisms and the environment. Adjuvants generally enhance the pesticidal efficacy and inadvertently the non-target effects of the active ingredient. Spray adjuvants are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are not registered by the USA EPA, leaving their regulation and monitoring to individual states. Organosilicone surfactants are the most potent adjuvants and super-penetrants available to growers. Based on the data for agrochemical applications to almonds from California Department of Pesticide Regulation, there has been increasing use of adjuvants, particularly organosilicone surfactants, during bloom when two-thirds of USA honey bee colonies are present. Increased tank mixing of these with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and other fungicides and with insect growth regulator insecticides may be associated with recent USA honey bee declines.

While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus (R) (Roundup SC), Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use III (R) (Roundup RtU), and technical-grade glyphosate at low concentrations [0-1000 mu g glyphosate acid equivalent (ae) l(-1)]. Roundup formulations differ in the percent of glyphosate as active ingredient (Roundup SC, similar to 50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), allowing indirect evaluation of the influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10-1000 mu g glyphosate ae l-1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 mu g glyphosate l(-1), but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 mu g l(-1) influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments.",2018,80,130,139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.004

Being of a perennial and monoculture nature in terms of its cultivation system, it provides a stable micro-climate for various insect pests, which cause substantial loss of crop. With the escalating cost of insect pest management and increasing concern about the adverse effects of the pesticide residues in manufactured tea, there is an urgent need to explore other avenues for pest management strategies. Aim: Integrated pest management (IPM) in tea invites an multidisciplinary approach owing to the high pest diversity in the perennial tea plantation system. In this review, we have highlighted current developments of nanotechnology for crop protection and the prospects of nanoparticles (NPs) in plant protection, emphasizing the control of different major pests of tea plantations. Methods: A literature search was performed using the ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar search engines with the following terms: nanotechnology, nanopesticides, tea, and insect pest. An article search concentrated on developments after 1988. Results: We have described the impact of various pests in tea production and innovative approaches on the use of various biosynthesized and syntheric nanopesticides against specific insect pest targets. Simultaneously, we have provided support for NP-based technology and their different categories that are currently employed for the management of pests in different agro-ecosystems. Besides the broad categories of active ingredients (AI) of synthetic insecticides, pheromones and natural resource-based molecules have pesticidal activity and can also be used with NPs as a carriers as alternatives to traditional pest control agents.

The spray application process can be viewed as a series of interdependent events, namely formulation, atomization, spray transfer and interaction with the plant surface leading to retention and penetration. Adjuvants play a role in each event for they are used extensively in formulation and as a tank mix during application. They facilitate solubilzation of the active ingredient and modify the physico-chemical properties of the spray solution. The size distribution of the spray may be shifted to a lower or higher VMD by surfactants and drift retardants, respectively. Spray retention and spreading are increased on difficult to wet plant surfaces. Foliar penetration can be increased by stomatal pore infiltration by surfactants that lower surface tension to < 30 mN m(-1). Transcuticular penetration may be depressed by adjuvants that do not penetrate, but reside on the surface, in the spray droplet residue and solubilize/complex the agrochemical in micelles (or other momomer agregrates) and effectively reducing the driving force. Other surfactants penetrate into the cuticle and plasticize the waxes, leading to increased transcuticular diffusion of the active ingredient.

Early studies (1973-1981) elucidated the special properties of these compounds, notably their extreme spreading and, by virtue of the exceptionally low surface tensions of their aqueous solutions, the ability to induce infiltration of spray formulations into foliage via stomata. Subsequent research at the New Zealand Forest Research Institute explored these and other properties in-depth, and demonstrated that they enabled the herbicide glyphosate to be used as a cost-effective alternative to 2,4,5-T for the control of forest scrubweeds. As a result, in 1985, 'Silwet' L-77 was the first organosilicone adjuvant to be commercialised, and various other products have subsequently been introduced. The chemistry and synthesis of these organosilicones have been detailed. A mechanistic approach has been adopted to consider the effects of the distinctive properties of organosilicones in each of the processes involved in spray application of agrochemicals. Commencing with spray formulation, the topics of foaming, hydrolytic stability and interactions with co-formulants are discussed. Progressing to spray application, consideration is given to the effects of organosilicones on atomisation and impaction (wetting, adhesion/reflection, spreading, retention/run-off), and the resultant influences on the activity of protectant agrochemicals. An assessment of the use of organosilicones with systemic agrochemicals includes examination of effects on foliar uptake, via both cuticular and stomatal pathways, and the rainfastness which the latter provides. Also considered is the physiological behaviour of organosilicones, specifically phytotoxicity and effects on translocation of active ingredients. The current and potential future use of organosilicones with herbicides, foliar nutrients, growth regulators, insecticides and fungicides is discussed, as is the specificity of their effects. Additionally, the potential application of organosilicone chemistry to adjuvant classes other than the spreader/penetrant type investigated to date is considered.

It contains glyphosate as the 'active ingredient', together with formulants. There are various versions of Roundup, with somewhat different effects depending on the formulants. Most genetically-modified crops are designed to tolerate Roundup, thus allowing spraying against weeds during the growing season of the crop without destroying it. Having been so heavily used, this herbicide is now found in the soil, water, air, and even in humans worldwide. Roundup may also remain as a residue on edible crops. Many studies have found harm to the environment and to health, making it imperative to regulate the use of Roundup and to ensure that its various formulations pose no danger when used in the long-term. Unfortunately, regulators may only assess the 'active ingredient', glyphosate, and ignore the toxicity of the formulants, which can be far more toxic than the active ingredient. This omission is in violation of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union. There are close ties between the regulators and the industry they are supposed to regulate. Objectionable practices include 'revolving doors' between the regulators and the industry, heavy reliance on unpublished papers produced by the industry while dismissing papers published by independent scientists, and strong covert influence on the regulatory process by industry.

Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEM were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are 100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete.

However, new environmental and human health hazards may emerge from nano-enhanced applications. This raises concerns for agricultural workers who may become primarily exposed to such xenobiotics during their job tasks. The aim of this review is to discuss promising solutions that nanotechnology may provide in agricultural activities, with a specific focus on critical aspects, challenging issues, and research needs for occupational risk assessment and management in this emerging field. Eco-toxicological aspects were not the focus of the review. Nano-fertilizers, (nano-sized nutrients, nano-coated fertilizers, or engineered metal-oxide or carbon-based nanomaterials per se), and nano-pesticides, (nano-formulations of traditional active ingredients or inorganic nanomaterials), may provide a targeted/controlled release of agrochemicals, aimed to obtain their fullest biological efficacy without over dosage. Nano-sensors and nano-remediation methods may detect and remove environmental contaminants. However, limited knowledge concerning nanomaterial biosafety, adverse effects, fate, and acquired biological reactivity once dispersed into the environment, requires further scientific efforts to assess possible nano-agricultural risks. In this perspective, toxicological research should be aimed to define nanomaterial hazards and levels of exposure along the life-cycle of nano-enabled products, and to assess those physico-chemical features affecting nanomaterial toxicity, possible interactions with agro-system co-formulants, and stressors. Overall, this review highlights the importance to define adequate risk management strategies for workers, occupational safety practices and policies, as well as to develop a responsible regulatory consensus on nanotechnology in agriculture.

Indiscriminate and negligent use of GBHs has promoted the emergence of glyphosate resistant weeds, and consequently the rise in the use of these herbicides. Glyphosate, the active ingredient of all GBHs, is combined with other chemicals known as co-formulants that enhance the herbicide action. Nowadays, the safety of glyphosate and its formulations remain to be a controversial issue, as evidence is not conclusive whether the adverse effects are caused by GBH or glyphosate, and little is known about the contribution of co-formulants to the toxicity of herbicides. Currently, alarmingly increased levels of glyphosate have been detected in different environmental matrixes and in foodstuff, becoming an issue of social concern. Some in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that glyphosate and its formulations exhibit estrogen-like properties, and growing evidence has indicated they may disrupt normal endocrine function, with adverse consequences for reproductive health. Moreover, multigenerational effects have been reported and epigenetic mechanisms have been proved to be involved in the alterations induced by the herbicide.

This review addresses aspects related to the impacts of atrazine in the environment, with focus on its effects on aquatic species, as well as the potential use of nanoencapsulation to decrease the impacts of atrazine. The application of atrazine leads to its dispersal beyond the immediate area, with possible contamination of soils, sediments, plantations, pastures, public supply reservoirs, groundwater, streams, lakes, rivers, seas, and even glaciers. In aquatic ecosystems, atrazine can alter the biota, consequently interfering in the food chains of many species, including benthic organisms. Nanoformulations loaded with atrazine have been developed as a way to reduce the adverse impacts of this herbicide in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Ecotoxicological bioassays have shown that this nanoformulations can improve the targeted delivery of the active ingredient, resulting in decreased dosages to obtain the same effects as conventional formulations.

The nanopesticides contain the carrier molecule or the active nanosized ingredient with a very high surface area to the volume property that provides them unique exploitable-advantages. Several formulations, viz., nanoemulsions, nanosuspensions, nano gels, metal compound-based nanopesticides, have been developed for different modes of action and vivid applications.

Glyphosate targets the shikimate metabolic pathway, which is found in plants but not in animals. Despite the relative safety of glyphosate, various adverse developmental and reproductive problems have been alleged as a result of exposure in humans and animals. To assess the developmental and reproductive safety of glyphosate, an analysis of the available literature was conducted. Epidemiological and animal reports, as well as studies on mechanisms of action related to possible developmental and reproductive effects of glyphosate, were reviewed. An evaluation of this database found no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspring. Furthermore, no plausible mechanisms of action for such effects were elucidated. Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposure. To estimate potential human exposure concentrations to glyphosate as a result of working directly with the herbicide, available biomonitoring data were examined. These data demonstrated extremely low human exposures as a result of normal application practices.

A Review,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"Glyphosate, in the history of agriculture, is one of the most commonly used herbicide, due to its high effectiveness and low cost compared to other solutions. Glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs), however, have been the subject of a long series of concerns and doubts, especially for public opinion and mass-media, concerning their possible toxic effects on humans and animals. In this paper, the most cited scientific literature about the persistence and possible toxicity of glyphosate and its formulations on animals has been revised. The different commercially-available formulations of GBHs contain diverse amounts of active ingredient (AI) and formulants. Therefore it is difficult to compare the many toxicity studies on animals, also because the researches currently available differ from each other, not only for the glyphosate formulations analyzed, but also for the animal's species tested, exposure times, for the treatment doses, etc. However, the results of this study, lead to the conclusion that there is a need for further research regarding the mechanisms of persistence in the environment of GBHs, the interference of glyphosate on reproductive cells and organs of animals, and the potential long-term toxic effects of this herbicide on animals.",2020,114,99,123,http://dx.doi.org/10.12895/jaeid.20201.1167

This can decrease the global volume of pesticide applied to crops. Nevertheless, the enhanced chemical stability of active ingredients implies persistence, and the good dispersion of active ingredients may induce interactions between nanopesticides and non-target organisms. Nanopesticides may thus have adverse impacts on non-target organisms, which is often not sufficiently considered by nanopesticide developers.

Growth was more strongly reduced in sterile synthetic media and less reduced in sterile soil; in unsterile soil only a transient growth reduction was detectable. Sensitivity was also observed in five out of eight other species analysed. In all sensitive species tested, spontaneous resistances to PT occurred. Under sterile conditions, PTT and PT reduced rhizobial nodulation rates of PT-resistant alfalfa plants drastically; however, nitrogen fixation in the few nodules that arose was unaffected. Because of the small number of nodules, the overall fixation rate was strongly diminished. In unsterile soil, nodulation and nitrogen fixation rates were not changed, possibly because of the rapid degradation of PTT and PT in the soil. Using a herbicide as model substance it could be demonstrated that the sensitivity of R. meliloti to chemical additives in the soil can be detected by analysing its growth rate, and that even a weak impact carl influence its nodulation capacity.

Nevertheless, questions regarding their safety are periodically raised. This review was undertaken to produce a current and comprehensive safety evaluation and risk assessment for humans. It includes assessments of glyphosate, its major breakdown product [aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)], its Roundup formulations, and the predominant surfactant [polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA)] used in Roundup formulations worldwide, The studies evaluated in this review included those performed for regulatory purposes as well as published research reports. The oral absorption of glyphosate and AMPA is low, and both materials are eliminated essentially unmetabolized. Dermal penetration studies with Roundup showed very low absorption. Experimental evidence has shown that neither glyphosate nor AMPA bioaccumulates in any animal tissue. No significant toxicity occurred in acute, subchronic, and chronic studies. Direct ocular exposure to the concentrated Roundup formulation can result in transient: irritation, while normal spray dilutions cause, at most, only minimal effects. The genotoxicity data for glyphosate and Roundup were assessed using a weight-of-evidence approach and standard evaluation criteria. There was no convincing evidence for direct DNA damage in vitro or in vivo and it was concluded that Roundup and its components do not pose a risk for the production of heritable/somatic mutations in humans, Multiple lifetime feeding studies have failed to demonstrate any tumorigenic potential for glyphosate. Accordingly, it was concluded that glyphosate is noncarcinogenic. Glyphosate, AMPA, and POEA were not teratogenic or developmentally toxic. There were no effects on fertility or reproductive parameters in two multigeneration reproduction studies with glyphosate, Likewise there were no adverse effects in reproductive tissues from animals treated with glyphosate, AMPA, or POEA in chronic and/or subchronic studies. Results from standard studies with these materials also failed to show any effects indicative of endocrine modulation. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of Roundup herbicide does not result in adverse effects on development, reproduction, or endocrine systems in humans and other mammals. For purposes of risk assessment, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were identified for all subchronic, chronic, developmental, and reproduction studies with glyphosate, AMPA, and POEA. Margins-of-exposure for chronic risk were calculated for each compound by dividing the lowest applicable NOAEL by worst-case estimates of chronic exposure. Acute risks were assessed by comparison of oral LD50 values to estimated maximum acute human exposure. It was concluded that, under present and expected conditions of use, Roundup herbicide does not pose a health risk to humans.

Initially developed to control the growth of weed species in agriculture, this herbicide also plays an important role in both modern silviculture and domestic weed control. The creation of glyphosate tolerant crop species has significantly increased the demand and use of this herbicide and has also increased the risk of exposure to non-target species. Commercially available glyphosate-based herbicides are comprised of multiple, often proprietary, constituents, each with a unique level of toxicity. Surfactants used to increase herbicide efficacy have been identified in some studies as the chemicals responsible for toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides to non-target species, yet they are often difficult to chemically identify. Most glyphosate-based herbicides are not approved for use in the aquatic environment; however, measurable quantities of the active ingredient and surfactants are detected in surface waters, giving them the potential to alter the physiology of aquatic organisms. Acute toxicity is highly species dependant across all taxa, with toxicity depending on the timing, magnitude, and route of exposure. The toxicity of glyphosate to amphibians has been a major focus of recent research, which has suggested increased sensitivity compared with other vertebrates due to their life history traits and reliance on both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. This review is designed to update previous reviews of glyphosate-based herbicide toxicity, with a focus on recent studies of the aquatic toxicity of this class of chemicals.

Adverse impacts of nanofertilizers on soil microflora were reported in past studies, but only considering a single application. Repeated applications are however more likely to occur in agriculture. We investigated effects of single versus repeated applications of a copper hydroxide nanofertilizer formulation (NFF) on soil enzyme activity and bacterial community. One or three applications were performed within 21 days to achieve same final level of Cu in soil (48 mg(Cu)/kg: the recommended dose of NFF). Besides, the active ingredient (i.e., copper hydroxide nanotubes (NT)) and dispersing agent (DA) of NFF, and an ionic fertilizer (i.e., CuSO4) were examined. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and urease (URE) showed negligible changes in the activities between the control and DA treatment. Bacterial community abundance, composition and diversity exhibited similar phenomena. Exposures to copper hydroxide NFF and NT or CuSO4 enhanced the activities of FDAse and NAG, weakened the activity of URE, and showed negligible changes in the LAP activity irrespective of single and repeated applications. Concentrations of NO3--N and NH4+-N in soil were also affected by the application mode of NFF. More importantly, responses of soil bacterial community to copper hydroxide NFF were highly dependent on its application mode, whereas similar responses were observed in the CuSO4 treatment regardless of single or repeated applications. This study provided new insights into environmental risk of copper hydroxide NFF that were ignored in previous studies using a single exposure. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

These losses pose a major problem for the California almond industry because of its dependence on honey bees as pollinators. The present study aimed to determine if combinations of pesticides applied during almond bloom during daylight hours were a possible explanation for these losses. In this study we aimed to mimic the spray application route of exposure to pesticides using a Potter Spray Tower to treat adult honey bees with commonly encountered pesticides and pesticide combinations at multiples of the maximum recommended field application rates. Tested insecticides included Altacor (R) and Intrepid (R), and tested fungicides included Tilt (R), Pristine (R), Luna Sensation (R), and Vangard (R). Synergistic toxicity was observed when the fungicide Tilt (active ingredient propiconazole) was applied with the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole), though neither caused significant mortality when applied independently. The study also looked at the effect of adding a spray adjuvant, Dyne-Amic (R), to pesticide mixtures. Dyne-Amic was toxic to honey bees at concentrations above the maximum recommended field application rate, and toxicity was increased when combined with the fungicide Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid). Addition of Dyne-Amic also increased toxicity of the Tilt and Altacor combination. These results suggest that application of Altacor and Tilt in combination with an adjuvant at the recommended field application rates could cause mortality in adult honey bees. These findings highlight a potential explanation for honey bee losses around almond bloom, emphasize that the safety of spray adjuvants to bees should not be assumed, and provide support for recommendations to protect bees from pesticides through application at night when bees are not foraging.

The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA > Roundup((R)) > glyphosate acid > IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity. Microtox((R)) bacterium and protozoa had similar sensitivities towards Roundup((R)) toxicity (i.e. IC50 from 23.5 to 29.5 mg AE/l). In contrast, microalgae and crustaceans were 4-5 folds more sensitive to Roundup((R)) toxicity than bacteria and protozoa. Except photosynthetic microalgae, POEA accounted for more than 86% of Roundup((R)) toxicity and the toxicity contribution of POEA was shown to be species-dependent.

DFB is potentially toxic to nontarget biota because it can enter aquatic systems through aerial application or runoff after precipitation events. Based on this concern, the objectives of this study were to: (1) compile, review, and synthesize literature on the fate, persistence, and environmental concentrations of DFB in both freshwater and saltwater environments; (2) compile, review, and synthesize acute and chronic aquatic toxicity data on DFB effects on freshwater and saltwater organisms; (3) assess possible risk to aquatic biota associated with the use of this insecticide in one specific area (Maryland); and (4) recommend future research based on the data gaps identified from this study. DFB has low solubility in water and exists as a technical grade (TG) and wettable powder (WP) formulation. The toxicity of both formulations is similar at concentrations <10-mu-g/l. Organic matter is a major factor influencing the adsorption and degradation of DFB in freshwater, saltwater, and sediment. The half-life of this insecticide in freshwater is almost-equal-to 3 days at a pH of 10 and temperature of 36-degrees-C. At lower pH conditions of 6 and at the same temperature, DFB is more persistent since half-life values of almost-equal-to 9 days have been reported. The half-life of DFB in soil is <14 days when the particle size was almost-equal-to 2-mu-m. The half-life is generally greater in cool, dry soil than in hot, wet soil. Aquatic vegetation acts as a sink for DFB by gradually adsorbing the chemical and releasing it over a period of time. Freshwater organisms demonstrated a wide range of sensitivity to DFB. Sensitivity was dependent on body composition (i.e., exo- vs. endoskeleton), trophic level, and life stage. During acute exposures, aquatic invertebrates were more than 25,000 times as sensitive to DFB than fishes. The most acutely sensitive species tested was the Amphipod, Hyallela azteca (96-h LC50 = 1.84-mu-g/l). A mature Plecopteran, Skwala sp., was the most resistant invertebrate species tested in acute tests (96-h LC50 > 100,000-mu-g/l). In chronic tests, DFB concentrations of 1-mu-g/l or greater were reported to eliminate populations of various Plecopteran (stoneflies) and Ephemeropteran (mayflies) species after 1 month of exposure. A 30-day LC50 of 0.1-mu-g/l DFB was also reported for the Tricopteran, Clistorinia magnifica. Freshwater fish were resistant to acute exposures of DFB as 96-h LC50s were generally >50,000-mu-g/l. Fish were also reported to accumulate DFB rapidly during acute exposures but were capable of eliminating this insecticide within 7 days. Most of the DFB aquatic toxicity studies with saltwater organisms were conducted with invertebrates. The most acutely sensitive species tested was the premolt stage of grass shrimp (96-h LC50 = 1.11-mu-g/l). The mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, the most resistant species tested, had a 96-h LC50 of 32.99 mg/l. The lowest reported chronic effect concentration for saltwater organisms exposed to DFB was 0.075-mu-g/l. This concentration was reported to significantly reduce reproduction in the mysid shrimp, Mysidopsis bahia. Data from the State of Maryland were used as an example for predicting the potential environmental effects of DFB on aquatic biota in Maryland waters. A case can be made for possible environmental effects given the worst case conditions of the most sensitive species (premolt stage of grass shrimp with a 96-h LC50 of 1.11-mu-g/l) exposed to the highest reported environmental concentration (1.5-mu-g/l DFB in water).

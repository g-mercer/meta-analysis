The majority of the substances tested were commercial formulations because, in most cases, it is difficult to assess the LC50 values of formulated mixtures from the results of the active ingredient. The other chemicals in the formulation may enhance or reduce the toxicity of the active ingredient."

This study evaluated a combination of pesticide and biodiesel that is nontoxic and biodegradable to overcome various problems with aromatic solvents. A 40.8% chlorpyrifos EC formulation was prepared by blending with biodiesel, cosolvent and surfactants and compared with a commercial product with only aromatic solvent as the carrier. Several physical and chemical tests were processed to compare these two formulations. Residual and phytotoxicity tests were performed with cabbage plants in a greenhouse. The experimental results revealed no considerable difference between the biodegradable and commercial formulations in stability tests. The results also indicated that the 40.8% chlorpyrifos EC prepared with biodiesel was up to grade. In addition, biodiesel can reduce the unpleasant odor that is generated from chlorpyrifos because of its low volatility. The high flash point of biodiesel enabled safer storage, transportation, and application of the formulation. According to the findings from residual experiments, biodiesel may increase the amount of active ingredient (AI) on the surface of plants because of its lipophilic characteristic, which enabled more effective pest controlling of the pesticide delivery system. In the phytotoxicity test, the use of biodiesel as the carrier did not harm plants in any application ratios and may reduce environmental risks. Therefore, for oil-soluble AIs, biodiesel may be a suitable alternative carrier for EC formulations. In contrast to commercial formulations, the use of biodiesel may help to reduce the dosage, cost of food production and adverse effects. Biodiesel may also provide added value, be environmentally friendly, and less hazardous. Therefore, biodiesel is an advantageous carrier to deliver AIs and to improve their performance. © 2012 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers."

Control release formulation is a prudent approach towards efficient pesticide utilization with reduced environmental implications. This work embodies an innovative easy-to-prepare pesticide formulation using chitosan (Cht)-alginate (Alg)-cenosphere (Cn) composite hydrogel beads for the sustained release of imidacloprid (IMI) with added advantage of UV safeguarding of pesticide, direct on-field application and upscalability. The IMI@Cht-Alg-Cn beads showed high encapsulation efficiency of around 80%, owing to their hollow structure and porous crosslinked network. Around 80% release of pesticide over a period of 72 hr substantiates a slower release profile under different pH conditions mimicking different soil types. Excitingly, leaching study reveal a two fold slow pesticide loss of 12 % compared to a commercial formulation. Subsequent validations in a model plant system (Vigna unguiculata) signify on-field universal applicability of the efficacious formulation. A long-term safety assessment study involving a human skin cell line (HaCaT), a plant model (Vigna radiata), soil-dwelling bacteria (E. coli and B. subtilis) and a non-targeted aquatic model organism (Daphnia magna) advocates a safe-by-design approach of the hydrogel beads. A 100% efficacy against Aphis crassivora (cowpea aphid) over 48 hrs compared to commercial formulation and technical grade of IMI suggest its suitability for on field application. This work merits sustainable pesticide use by providing application-based proofs and qualifies as a potential pesticide formulation for sustainable pest management. © 2021"
scopus110,Guy,NO,Queirós L.; Bouguerra S.; Pereira R.; Macário I.P.E.; Santos J.I.; Veloso T.; Gonçalves F.J.M.; Pereira P.; Pereira J.L.,Improved efficiency of an herbicide combining bentazone and terbuthylazine – can weeds be controlled with better environmental safety?†,2022,Environmental Science: Advances,1,342,355,10.1039/d2va00036a,"Chemical herbicides have been extensively used in agriculture to control the negative impacts of weeds in crops to improve agricultural yields. Authorized herbicidal active ingredients (AIs) have been combined in multiple ways to produce distinct commercial formulations targeting diverse weeds. However, interactions between AIs and co-formulants can result in unpredictable outcomes. In addition, the efficacy against target weeds of application rates much lower than those commercially recommended has been reported. In this context, the present work intends to assess the possibility of optimizing the combination of AIs within a commercial formulation of bentazone and terbuthylazine towards alternatives with decreased environmental hazardous potential, by considering both the mixture composition and application rates. The putative interaction between bentazone and terbuthylazine (AIs), as formulated within a commercial product and in alternative ratios and rates, was assessed, first, by testing with selected aquatic (Raphidocelis subcapitata) and terrestrial (Brassica napus) non-target sensitive indicators for environmental safety assessment, and then, by assessing the corresponding efficacy against a major target weed (Portulaca oleracea). Results showed that (i) commercially recommended rates represent a remarkable potential risk to soil and also aquatic ecosystems; (ii) application rates 10-fold lower than recommended are effective in the control of the main target weed; and (iii) a one-way formulation including only bentazone, which is already available on the market, seems to represent an environmentally safer alternative to the two-way formulation in the control of P. oleracea. These outcomes suggest that a more systematic assessment of the ecotoxicity, as well as the efficacy, of the combinations of pesticides used in commercial products during design stages could ensure a good performance of the agrochemicals against the targets, while improving their environmental safety regarding impacts in non-target organisms. © 2022 The Author(s).

Eighteen isolates, belonging to the genera Azotobacter, Azospirillum, Bacillus, Enterobacter Pseudomonas and Serratia, were exposed to four active compounds at concentration ranges similar to those in field soil. The sulfonylureas chlorsulfuron and rimsulfuron inhibited the growth of one of two Azospirillum and one of four Pseudomonas strains, while the imidazolinones imazapyr and imazethapyr were effective on two out of five Bacillus isolates. Surfactants in commercial formulation significantly enhanced rimsulfuron toxicity. With the exception of one Azospirillum strain, the differential tolerance of rhizobacteria to these herbicides was related to a differential sensitivity of their target, the activity of the first enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). Greenhouse pot studies were performed to assess the occurrence of inhibitory effects on bacterial growth in field conditions. Maize seedlings were bacterized with the two strains which had shown in vitro sensitivity to sulfonylureas. Following the application to the soil of a commercial formulation of rimsulfuron at rates of 0, 0.2 and 0.5 μmol a.i. kg-1, significative differences in the resulting degree of bacterial root colonization were found. Moreover, upon co-inoculation with two strains, one tolerant and one sensitive to the herbicide, the presence of rimsulfuron significantly enhanced root occupancy by resistant bacteria, suggesting that shifts in the microbial community structure of crop rhizosphere could indeed result as a consequence of weed control by AHAS inhibitors. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal “active principle” and “other ingredients,” with the latter collectively also known as “adjuvants.” These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments. © Copyright © 2018 Mesnage and Antoniou."

Typhimurium and Escherichia coli antibiotic responses,2017,Microbiology (United Kingdom),163,1791,1801,10.1099/mic.0.000573,"Herbicides are frequently released into both rural and urban environments. Commercial herbicide formulations induce adaptive changes in the way bacteria respond to antibiotics. Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli were exposed to common co-formulants of formulations, and S. enterica sv. Typhimurium was exposed to active ingredients dicamba, 2,4-D and glyphosate to determine what ingredients of the commercial formulations caused this effect. Coformulants Tween80 and carboxymethyl cellulose induced changes in response, but the pattern of the responses differed from the active ingredients, and effect sizes were smaller. A commercial wetting agent did not affect antibiotic responses. Active ingredients induced changes in antibiotic responses similar to those caused by complete formulations. This occurred at or below recommended application concentrations. Targeted deletion of efflux pump genes largely neutralized the adaptive response in the cases of increased survival in antibiotics, indicating that the biochemistry of induced resistance was the same for formulations and specific ingredients. We found that glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D, as well as co-formulants in commercial herbicides, induced a change in susceptibility of the potentially pathogenic bacteria E. coli and S. enterica to multiple antibiotics. This was measured using the efficiency of plating (EOP), the relative survival of the bacteria when exposed to herbicide and antibiotic, or just antibiotic, compared to survival on permissive media. This work will help to inform the use of non-medicinal chemical agents that induce changes in antibiotic responses. © 2017 The Authors."
scopus232,Guy,NO,Giglio A.; Vommaro M.L.,Dinitroaniline herbicides: a comprehensive review of toxicity and side effects on animal non-target organisms,2022,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,29,76687,76711,10.1007/s11356-022-23169-4,"The widespread use of herbicides has increased concern about the hazards and risks to animals living in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A comprehensive understanding of their effective action at different levels of biological organization is critical for establishing guidelines to protect ecosystems and human health. Dinitroanilines are broad-spectrum pre-emergence herbicides currently used for weed control in the conventional agriculture. They are considered extremely safe agrochemicals because they act specifically on tubulin proteins and inhibit shoot and root growth of plants. However, there is a lack of toxicity information regarding the potential risk of exposure to non-target organisms. The aim of the present review is to focus on side effects of the most commonly used active ingredients, e.g. pendimethalin, oryzalin, trifluralin and benfluralin, on animal non-target cells of invertebrates and vertebrates. Acute toxicity varies from slightly to high in terrestrial and aquatic species (i.e. nematodes, earthworms, snails, insects, crustaceans, fish and mammals) depending on the species-specific ability of tested organisms to adsorb and discharge toxicants. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and activation of oxidative stress pathways as well as alterations of physiological, metabolic, morphological, developmental and behavioural traits, reviewed here, indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of active ingredients poses a clear hazard to animals and humans. Further research is required to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of action of these herbicides in the animal cell and on biological functions at multiple levels, from organisms to communities, including the effects of commercial formulations. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Still, adverse environmental and human health effects resulting from its application have been reported. In this study, the possibility of readjusting the formulation of a commercial product combining azoxystrobin and tebuconazole (active ingredients – AIs; Custodia®) towards environmentally safer alternative(s) was investigated. Specifically, the sensitivity of non-target aquatic communities to each AI was first evaluated by applying the Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) approach. Then, mixtures of these AIs were tested in a non-target organism (Raphidocelis subcapitata) denoting sensitivity to both AIs as assessed from SSDs. The resulting data supported the design of the last stage of this study, where mixtures of those AIs at equivalent vs. alternative ratios and rates as in the commercial formulation were tested against two target fungal species: Pyrenophora teres CBS 123929 and Rhynchosporium secalis CBS 110524. The comparison between the sensitivity of non-target aquatic species and the corresponding efficacy towards target fungi revealed that currently applied mixture and rates of these AIs are generally environmentally safe (antagonistic interaction; concentrations below the EC1 for R. subcapitata and generally below the HC5 for aquatic non-target communities), but ineffective against target organisms (maximum levels of inhibition of 70 and 50% in P. teres CBS 123929 and R. secalis CBS 110524, respectively). Results additionally suggest a potentiation of the effects of the AIs by the other formulants added to the commercial product at tested rates. Overall, this study corroborates that commercial products can be optimized during design stages based on a systematic ecotoxicological testing for ingredient interactions and actual efficacy against targets. This could be a valuable pathway to reduce environmental contamination during transition to a more sustainable agricultural production. © 2023, The Author(s)."

However, little is known about the effects of commercial formulations containing this active ingredient (a.i.) on non-target organisms in tropical soils. Our objective was to assess the toxicity based on the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of imidacloprid, in the avoidance behaviour of earthworms and collembolans as well as in the reproduction of collembolans, in two representative soils of the Brazilian Cerrado with contrasting texture (clayey Oxisol and sandy Entisol). Ecotoxicity tests were carried out according to ISO protocols to assess the avoidance behaviour of earthworms (Eisenia andrei) and avoidance and reproduction of collembolans (Folsomia candida). In the earthworm’s avoidance test, more than 80% of the individuals were found in the control, in all tested concentrations, indicating a possible habitat function loss in both soils. The avoidance behaviour of collembolans was observed in both soils, being more expressive (up to 75% of escape) in Oxisol. In Entisol, only the two highest concentrations were avoided (up to 63%). There was a negative effect on the reproduction of collembolans in both soils, with a higher EC50 value (0.255 mg kg−1) in Oxisol than in Entisol (0.177 mg kg−1), demonstrating higher toxicity in the sandy soil. These differences were attributed to the contrasting texture of the studied soils, probably due to lower retention of the a.i. in the sandy soil, causing an increased bioavailability. This study demonstrated that imidacloprid can be highly toxic to soil invertebrates, even in soil concentrations lower than those expected from recommended dose, causing an impact on the edaphic organisms and, consequently, compromising its functions in the soil ecosystem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature."

Numerous results (mostly published in the years 2010-2013) concerning the action of glyphosate and its formulations in the recent decade were analyzed. Initial reports about alleged biodegradability of glyphosate in the environment turned out to be wrong. It has been shown that glyphosate remains in the soil and can reach people by spreading along with groundwater. Recent publications have shown that glyphosate is detected at low concentrations in the human blood. Publications cited in this article, which indicate a possible induction of neoplastic changes by glyphosate formulation, have raised great concern and controversy in the scientific world. Presenting adverse effects of glyphosate and its formulations we focused on the role of glyphosate formulations in hormonal disorders by impeding the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and the inhibition of aromatase activity. The impact of glyphosate on oxygen reactive species formation, changes in redox system and the effect on necrosis and apoptosis in various types of cells was shown. We also revealed that glyphosate as a phosphonate herbicide does not inhibit directly the activity of acetylcholinesterase. Based on numerous studies it was noted that commercial formulations of glyphosate exhibit higher toxicity than that of the active substance itself. The discussed problems clearly show the need to evaluate the toxicity of glyphosate and its formulations and related potential threat to humans. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. J.

scopus339,Guy,NO,Bradberry S.M.; Proudfoot A.T.; Vale J.A.,Glyphosate poisoning,2004,Toxicological Reviews,23,159,167,10.2165/00139709-200423030-00003,"Glyphosate is used extensively as a non-selective herbicide by both professional applicators and consumers and its use is likely to increase further as it is one of the first herbicides against which crops have been genetically modified to increase their tolerance. Commercial glyphosate-based formulations most commonly range from concentrates containing 41% or more glyphosate to 1% glyphosate formulations marketed for domestic use. They generally consist of an aqueous mixture of the isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, a surfactant, and various minor components including anti-foaming and colour agents, biocides and inorganic ions to produce pH adjustment. The mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate formulations are complicated. Not only is glyphosate used as five different salts but commercial formulations of it contain surfactants, which vary in nature and concentration. As a result, human poisoning with this herbicide is not with the active ingredient alone but with complex and variable mixtures. Therefore, It is difficult to separate the toxicity of glyphosate from that of the formulation as a whole or to determine the contribution of surfactants to overall toxicity. Experimental studies suggest that the toxicity of the surfactant, polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA), is greater than the toxicity of glyphosate alone and commercial formulations alone. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that glyphosate preparations containing POEA are more toxic than those containing alternative surfactants. Although surfactants probably contribute to the acute toxicity of glyphosate formulations, the weight of evidence is against surfactants potentiating the toxicity of glyphosate. Accidental ingestion of glyphosate formulations is generally associated with only mild, transient, gastrointestinal features. Most reported cases have followed the deliberate ingestion of the concentrated formulation of Roundup®1 (41% glyphosate as the IPA salt and 15% POEA). There is a reasonable correlation between the amount ingested and the likelihood of serious systemic sequelae or death. Advancing age is also associated with a less favourable prognosis. Ingestion of >85mL of the concentrated formulation is likely to cause significant toxicity in adults. Gastrointestinal corrosive effects, with mouth, throat and epigastric pain and dysphagia are common. Renal and hepatic impairment are also frequent and usually reflect reduced organ perfusion. Respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary oedema, infiltration on chest x-ray, shock, arrythmias, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis and hyperkalaemia may supervene in severe cases. Bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias are often present pre-terminally. Dermal exposure to ready-to-use glyphosate formulations can cause irritation and photo-contact dermatitis has been reported occasionally; these effects are probably due to the preservative Proxel® (benzisothiazolin-3-one). Severe skin burns are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, tingling and throat irritation. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis, and superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate. Management is symptomatic and supportive, and skin decontamination with soap and water after removal of contaminated clothing should be undertaken in cases of dermal exposure. © 2004 Adis Data Information BV.

Although the need for the assessment of health and environmental hazards deriving from the interactions between various substances found in commercial pesticide formulations is becoming increasingly recognized, the approval of pesticide products is still mostly limited to determining the toxicity of the individual ingredients ignoring the possible combined effects in mixtures. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature of in vitro and in vivo studies that simultaneously examine the toxicity of pesticide product formulations and their declared active ingredients to compare their toxicity to human health and to the environment. Two electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed the health effects of active pesticide ingredients and their product formulations. The literature search was performed with a combination of the following terms: “pesticide”, “formulation”, “commercial product”, “commercial pesticide” and “health”. After screening by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and reliability assessment of eligible publications was conducted by use of the ToxRTool. Two investigators independently screened the identified publications and extracted results from eligible studies. Our search yielded 36 toxicity studies; 23 studies investigated herbicides, 15 examined insecticides and 4 focused on fungicides. Twenty-four studies reported increased toxicity of the product formulations versus their active ingredients, which, in most cases, were attributed to the presence of adjuvants in the formulations. A significant number (n = 10) of studies focused on the comparative testing of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, and six of them concluded that Roundup, the dominant product formulation of glyphosate, is more toxic than the active ingredient alone. We identified only 8 studies demonstrating reduced toxicity of product formulations in relation to the active ingredient that might be due to a potential antagonistic effect between the constituents. The results of this review demonstrate the inadequacy of current EU testing requirements for assessing the health hazards of pesticide product formulations based mainly on the evaluation of the individual ingredients and of at least one representative use and formulation. Ignoring the possible risks deriving from the interaction between the active and other ingredients of various commercial pesticide product formulations might result in the misinterpretation of its toxicological profile. At EU level efforts are currently made to address this issue. In this context, we recommend that all product formulations should be fully assessed during the authorization process. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."

The present work used a systematic review and meta-analysis to group information from multiple studies on the selectivity of pesticides (279 commercial products) in rice, corn, soybean, apple and peach crops for immature stages (egg-larva, pre-pupa, and pupa) and adult parasitoids. The selected studies used the International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control (IOBC) methodology with the same adaptations for T. pretiosum. The meta-analysis found that corn crops had the highest frequency of tests (2 0 7). The most frequently tested active ingredients (a.i.) were glyphosate, glyphosate isopropylamine salt, and sulfur at frequencies of 41, 32 and 24 tests, respectively. The pesticides registered for rice crops showed the greatest sublethal effects on T. pretiosum, with an approximately 47% reduction in parasitism (RP) or emergence (RE). The adult stage of the parasitoid showed greater sensitivity to the tested pesticides (65% RP), in comparison to the immature stages. In general, insecticides showed superior toxicity for all development stages of T. pretiosum, compared to herbicides and fungicides, regardless of the recommended dosage for the crop. The present study aggregates information related to selectivity for the four life stages of T. pretiosum, contributing significantly to the integration of biological control and chemical control in rice, corn, soybean, apple and peach crops in Brazil. © 2020 The Authors"

Some publications in the open literature have suggested that the agricultural uses of “inert” ingredients, including trisiloxane polyether surfactants, may result in adverse effects on pollinators. We conducted a screening-level risk assessment to evaluate the potential risk to insect pollinators, using honey bees (Apis mellifera) as a surrogate, from exposure to three trisiloxane polyether surfactants based on agricultural application scenarios following the current US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidance. The exposure assessment included data from two sources: (1) use data reported in California's (USA) Pesticide Use Registry (PUR) database for all crops, and (2) an almond orchard residue study conducted using the three trisiloxane polyether surfactants. Honey bee laboratory studies with each of the trisiloxane polyether surfactants reported 50% lethal doses (LD50s) or no adverse effect levels, which were used as the effects inputs to BeeREX. The exposure and toxicity data were combined to estimate potential honey bee risk based on the determination of acute and chronic risk quotients (RQs) for larval and adult life stages. The RQs calculated using both the PUR use rates as well as the application rates and peak measured residues from the almond orchard residue study were below the USEPA acute and chronic levels of concern (acute, 0.4; chronic, 1.0). Based on these results, the use of these three trisiloxane polyether surfactants in agricultural use settings can be considered minimal risk to insect pollinators, and higher tier assessment is unnecessary for the characterization of risk.

Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These 'inerts' overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if 'the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison'. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."

Polyethoxylated tallow amines (POEAs) are non-ionic surfactants used in many herbicide formulations to promote the penetration of the active matter into plant cuticles. The present study aimed to assess the toxicity of a POEA surfactant system, the Genamin T-200®, on two larval stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of Genamin T-200® was quantified after 36 hr of exposure, considering both arrested development and abnormalities in D-shaped larvae. The ability of pediveliger larvae to metamorphose was studied after 24 hr exposure to Genamin T-200®. According to the European toxicity classification, the present results suggest that Genamin T-200® could be considered very toxic to embryo larval development, with an EC50 of 262 μg/l, and toxic to metamorphosis processes with an EC50 of 3,027 μg/l. The high toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations compared to the active ingredient and its by-product appears to be due primarily to surfactants."

In this study, the effects of two biodegradable surfactants (Tween-80 and Brij-35) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) on the growth and cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of Bacillus licheniformis B-1 were studied. Furthermore, their effects on the solubility, biosorption, and degradation of β-CY were investigated. The results showed that Tween-80 could slightly promote the growth of the strain while Brij-35 and β-CD exhibited little effect on its growth. The CSH of strain B-1 and the solubility of β-CY were obviously changed by using Tween-80 and Brij-35. The surfactants and β-CD could enhance β-CY biosorption and degradation by the strain, and the highest degradation was obtained in the presence of Brij-35. When the surfactant or β-CD concentration was 2.4 g/L, the degradation rate of β-CY in Brij-35, Tween-80, and β-CD treatments was 89.4%, 50.5%, and 48.1%, respectively. The half-life of β-CY by using Brij-35 was shortened by 69.1 h. Beta-CY content in the soil with both strain B-1 and Brij-35 decreased from 22.29 mg/kg to 4.41 mg/kg after incubation for 22 d.

But, the additives may not have been tested as thoroughly as the chief ingredients. The surfactant, nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP40), is an additive frequently present in pesticide formulations. We investigated the effects of NP40 and other constituents of a validamycin pesticide formulation on cell viability and on the expression of genes involved in cell damage pathways. Methods: The effects of validamycin pesticide ingredients on cell viability and of NP40 on the mRNA expression of 80 genes involved in nine key cellular pathways were examined in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Results: The chemicals present in the validamycin pesticide formulation were cytotoxic to SK-N-SH cells and NP40 showed the greatest cytotoxicity. A range of gene expression changes were identified, with both up- and down-regulation of genes within the same pathway. However, all genes tested in the necrosis signaling pathway were down-regulated and all genes tested in the cell cycle checkpoint/ arrest pathway were up-regulated. The median fold-change in gene expression was significantly higher in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway than in the hypoxia pathway category (p = 0.0064). The 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene, within the heat shock protein/unfolded protein response category, showed the highest individual increase in expression (26.1-fold). Conclusions: NP40 appeared to be particularly harmful, inducing gene expression changes that indicated genotoxicity, activation of the cell death (necrosis signaling) pathway, and induction of the 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene. © 2015 The Korean Association of Internal Medicine."

However, increased opposition to herbicide use from the public, environmental groups, and in some cases, agencies of both state and federal government, threatens the continued availability of herbicides to forest managers. Among the claims made by foes of herbicide use in forests are that little is known about herbicide toxicity, herbicides are toxic to fish and wildlife, and that tank mixtures and the inert ingredients used along with herbicides are more toxic than individual herbicides. This is the first in a series of technical bulletins that will address the issue of herbicide toxicity to fish and wildlife. This introductory bulletin describes the various types of herbicides, surfactants and other adjuvants, and outlines the basic methods of testing for herbicide toxicity as a part of the process of pesticide registration. In addition, a review is provided of the environmental fate and toxicity to fish and wildlife of the herbicide triclopyr, the active ingredient in the products Garlon 3A® and Garlon 4®. Triclopyr is not persistent in the environment, nor does it accumulate in living organisms. The expected environmental concentrations of triclopyr following application of triclopyr-containing herbicide formulations to forests are, in general, far below those known to be associated with any kind of toxicity to fish and wildlife. However, in cases where triclopyr and its residues might enter bodies of water, either through run-off or direct overspray, the margin of safety for some aquatic organisms is not as great for Garlon 4® as it is for Garlon 3A®."

Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEAs were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are ∼100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete. In order to resolve this confusion, laws requiring disclosure of the chemical composition of pesticide products could be enacted. Research to understand health implications from ingesting these substances is required. © 2019 The Authors"

Risk assessment of pesticides, drugs or personal care products that takes into account only active ingredients without the other formulation ingredients and adjuvants commonly used in their application will miss important toxicity outcomes detrimental to non-target species including pollinators and humans. Over a billion pounds of organosilicon surfactants from all uses are produced globally per year, making this a major component of the chemical landscape to which bees and humans are exposed. These silicones, like most “inerts”, are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and their residues are largely unmonitored. Lack of their public disclosure and adequate analytical methods constrains evaluation of their risk. Organosilicon surfactants, the most super-spreading and -penetrating adjuvants available, at relevant exposure levels impair honey bee learning, are acutely toxic, and in combination with bee viruses cause synergistic mortality. Organosilicon surfactants need to be regulated as a separate class of “inerts” from the more common silicones. In turn, impacts of organosilicon surfactant exposures on humans need to be evaluated. Silicones in their great diversity probably represent the single most ubiquitous environmental class of global synthetic pollutants.

Adsorbent characterization was conducted using Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis, atomic force microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. The efficiency for tannic acid adsorption from aqueous solution on the surface of prepared composites is studied and the adsorption process was modelled with different isotherm equations. Surfactant modifications of zeolites led to improved adsorption properties compared to FAU zeolites alone. The proposed mechanism controlling the adsorption of tannic acid onto surfactant modified zeolites mainly relies on π-π and hydrophobic interactions. The investigated materials are promising adsorbents for tannic acid and similar phenolics and may be important for environmental and dietary aspects of polyphenol persistence and usage. Further on, functionalized zeolites were studied for insecticide acetamiprid removal, prior to and after tannic acid retention. Promising findings of insecticide co-adsorption with tannic acid led to cytotoxicity evaluation. The cytotoxicity modulation effect of zeolites and tannic acid on acetamiprid points to the essential role of both components in insecticide toxicity reduction. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

Organophosphate-resistant and -susceptible populations responded similarly to spirotetramat, suggesting there is no cross-resistance between these insecticide classes. First and second instar male and female A. aurantii were 10- and 32-fold more susceptible to spirotetramat (LC50 = 0.1-0.2 ppm) compared with early third (LC50 = 1.5 ppm) and late third instar females (LC50 = 5.3 ppm). The LC99 value indicated that late stage third instar females would not be fully controlled by a field rate of spirotetramat; however, spirotetramat would reduce their fecundity by 89%. Field applications of spirotetramat in two water volumes and using two adjuvants (oil and a nonionic spray adjuvant) showed similar reduction in A. aurantii numbers, even though the higher water volume demonstrated more complete coverage. These data suggest that this foliarly applied systemic insecticide can be applied in as little as 2,340 liters/ha of water volume, minimizing application costs, and that the two adjuvants acted similarly. The endoparasitoid, A. melinus, was unaffected by the field rate of spirotetramat when it was applied to the host when the parasitoid was in the egg or larval stage. Adult A. melinus showed 2 wk of moderate reductions in survival when exposed to leaves with field-weathered residues.

The surfactant reduced binding of DDT to the membranes by about 5 fold. Inhibition correlated with the amount of DDT bound rather than with its concentration or physical state. In the absence of the surfactant, maximal inhibition and binding occurred when the membranes contained about 350 pmoles/μg of protein, an amount equal to 12 per cent of the protein content of the membranes. At low concentrations most of the DDT present is bound by the membranes, hence its effect decreases as membrane concentration increases. The kinetics of inhibition of the (Na + K)-ATPase by DDT, allenthrin and DDE were examined by varying the concentrations of inhibitor, Na+, or K+, while holding the concentration of the others constant. Inhibition by all of these compounds was potentiated by increased K+, and the increment in the inhibition caused by K+ was reversible by increased Na+ concentrations. Hence the effectiveness of DDT is dependent on the membrane concentration and the relative concentrations of Na+ and K+. The concentration of DDT required for maximal inhibition suggests that the inhibition is not caused by binding to a specific site on the enzyme, but is the result of indirect alterations of the membrane which interfere with allosteric transitions of the (Na + K)-ATPase mediated by Na+ and K+. © 1975."

Industrial grade surfactants are often highly mixed and how the mixing affects their interactions with pesticides and wax films remains largely unexplored. A better understanding could enable design of mixed nonionic surfactants for herbicides and fungicides to maximize their efficiency and reduce wastage whilst controlling their impact on plant wax films. Experiment: In this study, nonionic surfactants with general structure n-oxyethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12En) were used to form surfactant mixtures with the same average ethoxylate numbers but different hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values. Their mixed micellar systems were then used to solubilize a herbicide diuron (DN) and a fungicide cyprodinil (CP), followed by plant wax solubilization upon contact with wax films. These processes were monitored by 1H NMR and SANS. Finding: Pesticide solubilization made surfactant micelles effectively more hydrophobic but subsequent wax dissolution caused pesticide release and the restoration of the micellar amphiphilicity. Nonionic surfactants with lower HLBs form larger nanoaggregates, show enhanced wettability, and have better ability to solubilize and permeate pesticides across the wax film, but may cause significant damage to plant growth. These observations help explain why herbicides applied on weeds would benefit from surfactants with lower HLB values while fungicides require surfactants with HLBs to balance between delivery efficiency and potential phytotoxicity risks. © 2022"

In June 1991, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) categorized this compound into class E (according to EPA there are five categories of carcinogenicity), which means that it is probably not carcinogenic to humans. Unfortunately, the study carried out by Swedish oncologists in 2001 showed that glyphosate may induce cancer of the lymphatic system.

The results from 58 reports describing, among other factors, the effects of mixtures, hardness and temperature are summarized in this report. The most common test compound used in the reviewed studies was the anionic linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Most tests have been conducted in the laboratory with single species of freshwater fish, but a few studies have been conducted in ponds, lakes and rivers with natural biotic assemblages. Of the 58 reports reviewed, those describing the toxicities of mixtures containing surfactants are the most numerous (n = 32). The impact of the presence of pesticides and metals on surfactant toxicity has been unpredictable but oil-surfactant mixtures are usually more toxic than expected. Increasing water hardness and temperature increases surfactant toxicity in some cases but the outcome has been compound and species-specific. The presence of suspended solids and naturally occurring dissolved substances decreases the bioavailability of cationic surfactants but not that of anionic and nonionic surfactants. The impact of other chemical and physical modifying factors on surfactant toxicity are too poorly understood to generalize. Therefore, additional research is needed to determine these effects particularly on the chronic toxicities of surfactants at the multispecies level. These data are necessary if environmental hazard assessments for most surfactants are to go beyond their current simplification and be more effective in predicting ecological risk. © 1992."

It is desirable that rational and controlled use of pesticides should prevent a future concentration of these chemicals at critical levels in human tissue.

Hydrolysis was instantaneous under alkaline conditions (pH = 10). In aqueous suspensions of the alluvial soil (pH = 8), formulated rimsulfuron had a half-life of 7 days, whereas that of metabolite 1 was similar to that in water (about 3.5 days). The degradation of the two major metabolites was also studied in soil suspensions with the pure compounds at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg 1-1. The half-life of metabolite 1 ranged from 3.9 to 5 days, close to the previous values. Metabolite 2 was more persistent and its degradation is strongly dependent on the initial concentration (Co): half-life values ranged from 8.1 to 55 days at 2-10 mg 1-1, respectively. These values are higher than those determined from the kinetics of metabolite 1 transformation into metabolite 2 (t1/2 = 8-19 days).

The reason for the 4.6-fold underestimation of toxicity of the fifth product could not be explained unambiguously. Overall, the FET was found to be a suitable screening tool to verify whether the toxicity of formulated wood preservatives can reliably be predicted by CA. Applied as a quick and simple nonanimal screening test, the FET may support approaches of applying component-based mixture toxicity predictions within the environmental risk assessment of biocidal products, which is required according to European regulations. © 2012 SETAC."

This policy is thought to partially explain the conflicting outcomes of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and EPA assessments on glyphosate, and there is substantial scientific evidence that this approach has led to an underestimation of risk. In this paper, we present a review of EPA pesticide policy governing the regulation of active and other ingredients and findings from a survey of US agricultural scientists focused on their views of this EPA policy. The survey findings indicate that the scientists we surveyed support a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of pesticide products, including both active and inert ingredients, as well as the end use product, to test for combined effects. They also support the disclosure and labeling of inert ingredients to support independent testing of these chemicals. The results also indicate that university scientists oriented towards public science are more likely to support regulation than university scientists oriented towards private science. Overall, despite substantial evidence that the combination of all ingredients in pesticide products may be more toxic than the active ingredients alone, the current regulatory approach does not provide a pathway for the agency to respond to this science. In this sense, the scientific support for the agency’s current regulatory approach is unclear. © 2022, AESS."

Until recently, most of EPA's regulatory activities focused on the pesticide active ingredient, rather than the other components of the pesticide formulation known as inert ingredients. Although EPA has considered inert-specific data when reviewing some of the inert ingredients currently accepted for use in pesticides applied to food, it wasn't until the publication of EPA's Inert Strategy that a comprehensive policy regarding the information needed to determine the acceptability of a pesticide product inert ingredient was established. The implementation of this policy has led to changes in the types of substances proposed for use as inert ingredients as well as advancements in the methods for reviewing new inert ingredients. Emphasis on the long-term health and environmental effects of inert ingredients now requires pesticide registrants and others to consider these effects when developing new formulations. In order to encourage the use of less toxic inert ingredients. EPA has streamlined its review process, resulting in quicker decisions and more timely market introductions."

However, consumers encounter exposure to complex mixtures, for example multiple pesticide residues, by consuming food such as crops, fruits or vegetables. Currently, more than 450 active substances are approved in the European Union, and there is little data on effects after combined exposure to several pesticides. Toxicological animal studies would increase enormously, if pesticide combinations had to be analyzed in vivo. Therefore, in vitro methods addressing this issue are needed. We have developed 32 immunoaffinity-based mass spectrometry assays to investigate the impact of hepatotoxic active substances on liver proteins in human HepaRG cells. Five compounds were selected based on their (dis)similar capability to modulate protein levels, and on their combined use in commercially available formulations. Four binary mixtures were prepared from these five substances and tested in different concentrations over three time points. We applied a novel statistical method to describe deviations from additivity and to detect antagonistic and synergistic effects.

Most research into the effects of agrochemicals focusses on the effects of active ingredients. This reflects the assumption that 'inert' ingredients are non-toxic. A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used. We argue that 'inert' ingredients have distinct, and poorly understood, ecological persistency profiles and toxicities, making research into their individual effects necessary. We highlight the lack of mitigation in place to protect bees from 'inert' ingredients and argue that research efforts should be redistributed to address the knowledge gap identified here.

From some mostly older herbicides like atrazine, barban, 2,4-D, dichlorprop, dinoseb, DNOC, glyphosate, metamitron and paraquat, however, it can be seen that the effects of active ingredients and its formulated preparations as well as those between several preparations may differ. This especially occurs when higher dosages or stronger biocidal compounds were used. Even the formulation additives of pesticides themselves affected soil microorganisms in some cases and, therefore, modified pesticide effects, but only few references are available.

Results from regulatory guideline studies, reports from Regulatory Agencies, and some literature studies point to a lack of endocrine disrupting properties of the active ingredient glyphosate. On the other hand, many in vivo and in vitro studies, using different experimental model systems, have demonstrated that GBHs can disrupt certain hormonal signaling pathways with impacts on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and other organ systems. Importantly, several studies showed that technical-grade glyphosate is less toxic than formulated GBHs, indicating that the mixture of the active ingredient and formulants can have cumulative effects on endocrine and reproductive endpoints, which requires special attention from Regulatory Agencies.

This article contributes to a better understanding of the factors that limit microbial control of pests in EU agriculture by providing the first evaluation of the evolution of microbial biological control agent (MBCA) EU-level approval combined with that of microbial biological control product (MBCP) national-level authorization, discusses recent trends in research and offers some policy recommendations. By 2020, the EU had caught up with the USA regarding research output, approved MBCAs, and MBCA approval procedures (first stage). Despite improvements from 2014 to 2019, the number of authorized MBCPs (second stage) has progressed slowly and unevenly across the EU. Significant progress is concentrated in countries with more extensive agricultural land and higher research intensity. The EUʼs focus on promoting more sustainable agriculture by increasing the availability of low-risk pesticides of biological origin as alternatives to conventional chemical pesticides has gained traction in recent years. Nevertheless, more efforts to improve the capacity and expertise of laggard EU Member States to contribute to the approval of MBCA, authorization of MBCP, and stimulating market availability are needed.

Lack of disclosure of adjuvant and formulation ingredients coupled with a lack of adequate analytical methods constrains the assessment of total chemical load on beneficial organisms and the environment. Adjuvants generally enhance the pesticidal efficacy and inadvertently the non-target effects of the active ingredient. Spray adjuvants are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are not registered by the USA EPA, leaving their regulation and monitoring to individual states. Organosilicone surfactants are the most potent adjuvants and super-penetrants available to growers. Based on the data for agrochemical applications to almonds from California Department of Pesticide Regulation, there has been increasing use of adjuvants, particularly organosilicone surfactants, during bloom when two-thirds of USA honey bee colonies are present. Increased tank mixing of these with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and other fungicides and with insect growth regulator insecticides may be associated with recent USA honey bee declines. This database archives every application of a spray tank adjuvant with detail that is unprecedented globally. Organosilicone surfactants are good stand alone pesticides, toxic to bees, and are also present in drug and personal care products, particularly shampoos, and thus represent an important component of the chemical landscape to which pollinators and humans are exposed.

While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus® (Roundup SC), Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use III® (Roundup RtU), and technical-grade glyphosate at low concentrations [0–1000 μg glyphosate acid equivalent (ae) l−1]. Roundup formulations differ in the percent of glyphosate as active ingredient (Roundup SC, ∼50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), allowing indirect evaluation of the influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10–1000 μg glyphosate ae l−1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 μg glyphosate l−1, but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 μg l−1 influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments. © 2018"

Considering the possible influence of both substances on the enzyme systems involved in the xenobiotic metabolism, potentiation of its carcinogenic action in the formulation can be expected. No genotoxic effect was revealed studying in vivo studies the mutagenic activity of both substances isolated. Therefore, both substances are epigenetic carcinogens with a promoter threshold mechanism of action.

Following label rate applications of Rimon 0.83EC to apple trees, average residue concentrations of the active ingredient, novaluron, were found to be 3.38 ppm in tree-collected pollen. Residues of the major co-formulant in Rimon 0.83EC, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were below the limit of detection in the field, but a growth chamber study described here found that NMP can persist in pollen for up to 7 d with average concentrations of 69.3 ppm. Concurrent larval rearing studies found novaluron and NMP to be toxic to developing honey bees at doses as low as 100 ppb and 100 ppm, respectively. Nucleus colony feeding studies found that chronic exposure to Rimon 0.83EC at doses as low as 200 ppm (18.6 ppm novaluron) can result in interruptions to brood production that can last for up to 2 wk after exposure. Taken together, these data indicate the use of Rimon 0.83EC on blooming flowers is a significant threat to honey bee reproduction, and suggest the need for more strict and clear usage guidelines. © The Author 2017.

We collected acute systemic toxicity data from formulations that contained one of several acutely-toxic active ingredients. The resulting acute data set includes 210 formulations tested for oral toxicity, 128 formulations tested for inhalation toxicity and 31 formulations tested for dermal toxicity. The GHS additivity formula was applied to each of these formulations and compared with the experimental in vivo result. In the acute oral assay, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 110 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (48% accuracy) and 119 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (43% accuracy). With acute inhalation, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 50 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (61% accuracy) and 34 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (73% accuracy). For acute dermal toxicity, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 16 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (48% accuracy) and 20 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (36% accuracy). This data indicates the acute systemic toxicity of many formulations is not the sum of the ingredients’ toxicity (additivity); but rather, ingredients in a formulation can interact to result in lower or higher toxicity than predicted by the GHS additivity formula. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

Herein, a commercial Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide formulation (NPF), the active ingredient of NPF (AI-NPF), the prepared Cu(OH)2 nanotubes (NT) with comparable morphology and size to AI-NPF, and CuSO4 were respectively applied to soil at normal doses (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg), followed by an application of neonicotinoid thiacloprid after an interval of 21 d, showing that NPF at doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) mitigated thiacloprid degradation compared to control and CuSO4. Furthermore, AI-NPF was the primary component that contributed to the mitigation effect of NPF, which was also validated by the NT. Large differences in the degradation efficiency of thiacloprid in sterilized and unsterilized soils with Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides suggested that biodegradation was the primary process responsible for thiacloprid degradation, especially as chemical degradation was negligible. Besides a decrease of thiacloprid bioavailability due to adsorption by Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides, we demonstrated that Cu(OH)2 nanopesticides changed soil microbial communities, reduced nitrile hydratase activity and down-regulated thiacloprid-degradative nth gene abundance, which thus mitigated thiacloprid biodegradation. Clearly, this study shed light on the potential environmental risks of Cu(OH)2 nanopesticide. © 2019 The Authors"

In surface waters within the agricultural landscape, however, contamination is usually characterized by complex pesticide mixtures. To estimate the joint effects caused by these complex mixtures, mathematical models have been proposed. Among these, the model of concentration addition (CA) is suggested as default model for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures as it is considered protective for mixtures composed of similar and dissimilar acting substances. Here we assessed the suitability of CA predictions for seven field relevant pesticide mixtures using acute (immobility) and chronic (reproduction) responses of the standard test species Daphnia magna. Pesticide mixtures indicated largely additive or less than additive effects when using CA model predictions as a reference. Moreover, we revealed that deviations from CA predictions are lower for chronic (up to 3.2-fold) relative to acute (up to 7.2-fold) response variables. Additionally, CA predictions were in general more accurate for complex mixtures relative to those composed of only a few pesticides. Thus, this study suggests CA models as largely protective for the risk assessment of pesticide mixtures justifying its use as default model. At the same time, extrapolating conclusions about the joint effects of pesticides from acute to chronic responses is uncertain, due to partly large discrepancies with regards to the deviation of model prediction and observed effects between exposure scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

In some instances, the other ingredients have detrimental effects on nontarget species. Other factors such as UV radiation and predator cues have been shown to modify the toxicity of pesticides. In a laboratory study we compared the effects of technical-grade active ingredients to commercial formulations of seven common pesticides in the presence or absence of UV radiation on the survival of Rana clamitans (green frog) tadpoles over 96 h. We found a significant difference in the survival of tadpoles in technical-grade active ingredients versus commercial formulations in all of the pesticides tested. We also found that either the presence or the absence of UV radiation affected the survival of tadpoles in five of the seven pesticides tested. These results suggest that there is a need to test the effects of both active ingredients and commercial formulations of pesticides and, also, to include relevant abiotic factors like UV radiation treatments in the testing of pesticides because they can have a dramatic impact on the toxicity of some chemicals.",2011,60,145,155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9528-z

Nevertheless, they have been reported to affect several non-target organisms. Most toxicity studies focus on the effects on pollinators or terrestrial invertebrates and evaluate either the active ingredient or the commercial formulation. In the present study, we aimed to assess the long-term effects of the active ingredient acetamiprid and a broadly used commercial formulation (Assail (R) 70) on the non-target freshwater gastropod Biomphalaria straminea using a battery of biomarkers. A 14 day-exposure of adult organisms to both active ingredient and commercial formulation increased carboxylesterase activity and glutathione content, inhibited superoxide dismutase activity and decreased reactive oxygen species levels. The commercial formulation additionally increased glutathione S-transferase activity and inhibited catalase activity. The results indicate a greater toxicity of the commercial formulation than that of the active ingredient alone. Cholinesterase activity, development and offspring survival of B. straminea were not impaired. We conclude that the toxicity of acetamiprid on this gastropod species is mainly related to effects on detoxification and oxidative metabolism responses. This study provides novel information about the adverse effects of the active ingredient and a commercial formulation of a widely used neonicotinoid on a non-target aquatic species.",2020,192,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110248

Application rates were: agricultural rate, 20 and 200 mug a.i. g(-1) soil. Application at normal agricultural rates did not lead to significant effects on soil microbial activity, whereas soil microbial activity was markedly stimulated when pure and commercial formulations of the six herbicides were applied at 20 mug a.i. g(-1) soil. The addition of 200 mug a.i. g(-1) soil of four pure herbicides (atrazine, terbuthylazine, rimsulfuron, primisulfuron-methjyl) led to a significant decrease of soil microbial activity. Commercial formulations characterized by a higher relative a.i. concentration (atrazine and primisulfuron-methyl) approximately determined the same decreasing effect of the pure compound, whereas herbicide formulations with a lower relative a.i. concentration (terbuthylazine and rimsulfuron) produced a significant increase in soil microbial activity.",2002,82,519,527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067310290009514

Acute and chronic intoxication of humans and animals, contamination of soil, water and food are the consequences of the current demand and sales of these products. In addition, pesticides such as glyphosate are sold in commercial formulations which have inert ingredients, substances with unknown composition and proportion. Facing this scenario, toxicological studies that investigate the interaction between the active principle and the inert ingredients are necessary. The following work proposed comparative toxicology studies between glyphosate and its commercial formulation using the alternative model Caenorhabditis elegans. Worms were exposed to different concentrations of the active ingredient (glyphosate in monoisopropylamine salt) and its commercial formulation. Reproductive capacity was evaluated through brood size, morphological analysis of oocytes and through the MD701 strain (bcIs39), which allows the visualization of germ cells in apoptosis. In addition, the metal composition in the commercial formulation was analyzed by ICP-MS. Only the commercial formulation of glyphosate showed significant negative effects on brood size, body length, oocyte size, and the number of apoptotic cells. Metal analysis showed the presence of Hg, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb in the commercial formulation, which did not cause reprotoxicity at the concentrations found. However, metals can bio-accumulate in soil and water and cause environmental impacts. Finally, we demonstrated that the addition of inert ingredients increased the toxic profile of the active ingredient glyphosate in C. elegans, which reinforces the need of components description in the product labels.

Due to its widespread use around the world, relatively high concentrations of glyphosate have been detected in soil and aquatic environments. The presence of glyphosate in aquatic ecosystems has aroused the attention of researchers because of its potential negative effects on living organisms, both animals and plants. In this context, this review intends to summarize results of studies aimed at evaluating the effects of glyphosate (both as active ingredient and component of commercial formulations) on marine invertebrates. Generally, data obtained in acute toxicity tests indicate that glyphosate and its commercial formulations are lethal at high concentrations (not environmentally realistic), whereas results of long-lasting experiments indicate that glyphosate can markedly affect biological responses of marine invertebrates. Consequently, more efforts should be addressed at evaluating chronic or sub-chronic effects of such substances to marine invertebrate species.",2020,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse8060399

Toxicological studies focus almost exclusively on the active ingredients of pesticides, instead of commercial formulations, whose toxicity can differ as a result of nonspecified ingredients. The intensive use of endosulfan as a wide-ranging insecticide over the last few decades makes it one of the most frequently detected contaminants in the aquatic environment, even after it has been restricted worldwide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bioaccumulation and organ distribution of waterborne endosulfan in the freshwater fish Cichlasoma dimerus, comparing the active ingredient and a commercial formulation. Males were exposed to 0.7 mu g/L endosulfan for 2 wk, which was quantified (gas chromatography with an electron capture detector) in the liver, testes, gills, brain, and muscle. The results suggest rapid metabolism of alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan isomers to endosulfan sulfate (endosulfan-S) in tissues. Isomer levels were highest in gills, indicative of recent uptake. Levels of endosulfan-S were highest in liver and testes for the active ingredient and testes and brain for the commercial formulation. For the active ingredient, endosulfan-S levels showed a positive correlation with organ-lipid percentage. No correlation was evident for the commercial formulation, indicating that the presence of adjuvants alters endosulfan distribution because gills and liver showed a higher uptake and mobilization of beta-endosulfan. These differences in organ distribution may alter tissue-specific toxicity; therefore, additives cannot be considered inactive even if nontoxic. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-8.

Commercial formulations of pesticides used by agricultural workers and urban sprayers are responsible for thousands of intoxications in developing countries and may not have the same effects as active pure ingredients. Therefore, we compared effects of MET technical (METt) and commercial (METc) grades on sperm quality and DNA integrity. Male mice were injected (intraperitoneal, i.p.) with METt or METc (3.75, 5, and 7 mg/kg bw/day/4 days) and sacrificed 24 h post-treatment. Sperm cells collected from epididymis-vas deferens were evaluated for quality parameters, DNA damage by the comet assay, and lipoperoxidation by malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was evaluated by acetylthiocho-line inhibition as an index of overall toxicity. A dose-dependent AChE inhibition was observed with both formulations. Sperm quality was decreased after treatment with both MET compounds, but the commercial formulation showed stronger effects; a similar profile was observed with the DNA damage, being METc more genotoxic. None MET formulation increased MDA, suggesting no peroxidative damage involved. In summary, the commercial formulation of MET was more reprotoxic and genotoxic than the active pure ingredient, highlighting that commercial formulations must be considered for more appropriate risk assessment of pesticide exposures.

Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum, non-selective herbicide and commonly used to eliminate weeds in agricultural and forest settings. Studies evaluating glyphosate toxicity in animals and environment show that commercial formulations of glyphosate are more toxic than the active component itself. Objectives. Technical grade glyphosate was compared with the commercial formulation Roundup(R) in their respective toxicities on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Materials and methods. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were exposed to different concentrations of glyphosate, either technical grade or in the form of Roundup for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. Cytotoxicity was assayed by trypan blue dye exclusion method and reduction of (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2Htetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide inner salt) XTT reagent. Results. Both technical grade glyphosate and Roundup(R) formulation were toxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cytotoxicity of Roundup(R) was higher than cytotoxicity of glyphosate, since the LC50 (50% lethal concentration) determined by the trypan blue exclusion method at 24 h was the equivalent of 56.4 mu g/ml of glyphosate in the form of Roundup(R) and 1,640 mu g/ml (1.64 mg/ml) for technical grade glyphosate. Conclusions. This in vitro study confirmed the toxic effects on human cells by glyphosate and its commercial preparations. Commercial formulations were more cytotoxic than the active component alone, supporting the concept that additives in commercial formulations play a role in the toxicity attributed to glyphosate-based herbicides.",2007,27,594,604,http://dx.doi.org/10.7705/biomedica.v27i4.176

Glyphosate-based commercial formulations contain adjuvants, making them even more toxic than the active ingredient (a.i.) itself. The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a freshwater invasive species which has been found to increase glyphosate dissipation in water and to accelerate eutrophication. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capability of L. fortunei to reduce the concentration of glyphosate in two commercial formulations, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Results were compared with the decay of the a.i. alone and in presence of mussels. Evasive response and toxicity tests were performed in a first set of trials to analyze the response of L. fortunei exposed to Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R). Subsequently, we conducted a 21-day degradation experiment in 2.6-L microcosms applying the following treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), Glifosato Atanor (R) (A), Roundup Max (R) (R), 20 mussels in dechlorinated tap water (M), and the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade (MG) or formulated form (MA and MR) (all by triplicate). Samples were collected at days 0, 1, 7, 14 and 21. No significant differences in glyphosate decay were found between treatments with mussels (MG: 2.03 +/- 0.40 mg L-1; MA: 1.60 +/- 0.32 mg L-1; MR: 1.81 +/- 0.21 mg L-1), between glyphosate as a.i. and the commercial formulations, and between the commercial formulations, suggesting that the adjuvants did not affect the degrading potential of L. fortunei. In addition to the acceleration of glyphosate dissipation in water, there was an increase in the concentration of dissolved nutrients in water (N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) even higher than that caused by the filtering activity of the mussels, probably resulting from stress or from the degradation of glyphosate and adjuvants. We believe that a larger bioavailability of these nutrients due to glyphosate metabolization mediated by mussels would accelerate eutrophication processes in natural water bodies. The approach used here, where L. fortunei was exposed to two commercial formulations actually used in agricultural practices, sheds light on the potential impact of glyphosate decay on water bodies invaded by this species.",2020,201,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110794

These chemicals, however, are also potential penetration enhancers for mammalian skin, The effect of formulation on dermal absorption of the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, and trifluralin and their commercial formulations Aatrex, Lasso, and Treflan was determined. In vitro absorption studies were performed by placing hairless mouse skin in a Bronough flow-through diffusion system. Donor solution was spiked with C-14-labeled herbicide, and its penetration through the skin was monitored in 90-min fractions. Results demonstrate that dermal penetration of commercially formulated compound was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of the pure compound at the same concentration. The physical properties of a herbicide predicted penetration (r(2) = 0.97-0.99) for commercial formulations but were not as effective at predicting absorption for the pure compounds (r(2) = 0.51-0.71). The solvents associated with the hydrophobic herbicide Treflan altered dermal penetration of the more hydrophilic herbicides Lasso and Aatrex. Furthermore, although the most hydrophobic compound had the least penetration, it accumulated in the stratum corneum at the greatest rate.

PPP regulation also demands the assessment of putative interactions among formulants within each product recipe and consequent effects, but these results are often unavailable. Such a case is that of the herbicide Winner Top (Selectis (R), Portugal), which we selected as a model commercial formulation in the present study specifically aiming at (i) characterising its aquatic toxicity towards sensitive eco-receptors (Raphidocelis subcapitata, Chlorella vulgaris, Lemna minor and Lemna gibba), as well as that of its active substances (a.s.) nicosulfuron and terbuthylazine; (ii) comparing the ecotoxicity among the commercial formulation, the corresponding mixture of its a.s. and this a.s.'s mixture increasingly enriched with the formulants. Single chemical testing revealed that terbuthylazine was the strongest microalgae growth inhibitor and nicosulfuron was the strongest macrophyte growth inhibitor. On the other hand, the commercial formulation was consistently less toxic than the corresponding mixture of the a.s., suggesting that Winner Top formulants (72.9% of the commercial formulation) interact with the a.s., promoting less than additive effects in the selected non-target species. Importantly, this environmentally protective effect of the formulation can be apparent. Because macrophytes share most physiological features with the weeds targeted by the studied herbicide, it is likely that increased application doses are required to reach desired efficacy levels with the consequent detrimental increase of PPP residues load in edge-of-field freshwater ecosystems.",2018,27,945,955,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1939-z

Since human exposure to herbicides is not only to the active principles, but also to all the chemicals present in the commercial formulation, we tested both pure and commercial linuron. Groups of rats were treated with gavage containing different doses of the herbicide (pure compound or commercial formulation) for 14 days. The doses were 150, 300 and 450 mg/kg b.wt. for the pure compound and 315.8, 631.6 and 947.4 mg/kg b.wt. for the commercial formulation (47.5% of linuron).

Micronuclei induction was analysed in rat bone marrow erythrocytes. Results obtained were mainly negative when the excretion of mutagenic metabolites in urine and faeces of animals treated with the pure compound or with the linuron-based commercial formulation were monitored, whereas an increase in the urinary excretion of thioethers and D-glucaric acid was observed in rats treated with the commercial formulation. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed in the treated animals. However, linuron affected the viability of hepatocytes isolated from animals treated with higher doses. This cytotoxicity was accompanied by the induction of DNA single-strand breaks in the liver, as seen by the alkaline elution assay.

The organisms are exposed both to the fungicide active ingredients and to the adjuvants of commercial formulations. All these ingredients are brought to the hive by bee foragers through contaminated pollen and nectar, thus exposing also immature individuals during larval phase. This work aimed to compare the effects of larval exposure to the fungicide pyraclostrobin (active ingredient and commercial formulation) and its influence on the cytotoxicity to midguts in adults, which were inoculated with the Nosema ceranae spores in the post-emergence stage. Under laboratory conditions, Apis mellifera larvae received an artificial diet containing fungicide solution from the third to the sixth day of the feeding phase. One-day-old adult workers ingested 100,000 infectious N. ceranae spores mixed in sucrose solution. Effects on midgut were evaluated through cellular biomarkers of stress and cell death. The exposure to the fungicide (active ingredient and commercial formulation) did not affect the larval post-embryonic development and survival of adult bees. However, this exposure induced cytotoxicity in the cells of the midgut, showed by the increase in DNA fragmentation and alteration in the HSP70 immunolabeling pattern. Without the pathogen, the midgut cytotoxic effects and HSP70 immunolabeling of the organisms exposed to the commercial formulation were lower when compared to the exposure to its active ingredient. However, in the presence of the pathogen, the cytotoxic effects of the commercial formulation to the adult bees' midgut were potentialized. The pathogen N. ceranae increased the damage to the intestinal epithelium of adult bees. Thus, realistic doses of pyraclostrobin present in beebread consumed by larvae can affect the health and induce physiological implications to the midgut functions of the adult bees.

Data on the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of deltamethrin are rather controversial, depending on the genetic system or the assay used. The aim of the present study was to analyze previously demonstrated metabolic changes using aspecific noninvasive methods in rats which art: potentially applicable for monitoring occupational exposure. Since human exposure to pesticides occurs not only to active principles but to ail chemicals present in a commercial formulation, we tested both the pure compound and a deltamethrin-based commercial formulation. Groups of rats were treated, i.p., consecutively for 7 days. The daily doses tested were 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight for pure deltamethrin, corresponding to volumes of 178.57 and 377.14 mu l/kg body weight for the commercial formulation (containing 2.8% deltamethrin). Urine was analyzed for mutagenic metabolites, thioethers, and D-glucaric acid content. Faeces extracts were tested for mutagenicity. Results show that DGA urinary excretion values did not mirror the phase I enzyme induction capability of the insecticide. Results obtained for urinary thioethers do not agree completely with those obtained on the influence of deltamethrin on glutathione S-transferase activity in rat liver. In fact, after administration of the deltamethrin commercial formulation, highest thioether excretion values were obtained during the treatment time for treated animals, as compared to controls. The mean values (+/-SEM) of thioether excretion were 0.033 +/- 0.002 mu mole -SH/24 h for control animals, 0.122 +/- 0.004 and 0.185 +/- 0.025 for the two treatment groups. Thence, thioether determination in urine samples seems to be a suitable aspecific noninvasive method for assessing exposure to deltamethrin-based formulations, particularly those containing xylene and mesitylene as solvents, as in the tested formulation. Negative or toxic results obtained in the urinary and faecal mutagenicity test seem to exclude the formation and excretion of mutagenic metabolites following treatment with deltamethrin.",1997,33,323,328,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449900260

Water suspensions of a commercial formulation of Switch were used in phase partition experiments for a set of selected soils from vineyards. A clean-up procedure of the supernatant was developed for the phase separation in presence of the adjuvants prior to quantification of cyprodinil and fludioxonil. The maximum sorption on the solid phase (which includes soil and other solids from the commercial formulation of Switch) was 2000 mg kg(-1) for fludioxonil and 3000 mg kg(-1) for cyprodinil after incubation with 800 mg L(-1) of Switch. However, adsorption to soil particles were lower; fludioxonil concentrations adsorbed in soils range from 50 to 80 mg kg(-1) of soil and cyprodinil concentrations range from 120 to 260 mg kg(-1) of soil. Adjuvants increased the solubility of fludioxonil in pure water at 25 degrees C up to 5 times that of the pure substance (from 1.8 to 9 mg L(-1) in control samples), and show a strong influence on the adsorption in soil.

Here, we explore the potential matrix effects of the commercial formulations on the photochemistry of two NNs, dinotefuran (DNF) and nitenpyram (NPM). The commercial formulations and the pure reagents, both embedded in KBr pellets, were irradiated at wavelengths from 254 to 350 nm. Loss of the NN and product formation were followed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry. Quantum yields for loss of NN in commercial formulations were within experimental error of the pure NN. However, quantum yields for loss in KBr were consistently smaller than those previously measured for thin films of pure compounds, suggesting increased quenching of excited intermediates in the dense solid KBr matrix. At 350 nm where NPM absorbs, the quantum yield for loss in the formulation was about half that of the pure compound, which was attributed to a reduction in the NPM absorption cross section due to the presence of water taken up by additional formulation ingredients. Major products of DNF and NPM photolysis were the same in the formulation and in the pure compound. However, in contrast to previous thin film measurements, unexpected infrared peaks at 2222 and 2136 cm(-1) during photolysis of DNF in KBr were identified as N2O trapped in the KBr matrix and NO+ respectively.

These herbicides are frequently paired with a safener, which prevents herbicidal damage to the crop without diminishing weed control. Formulated herbicide products that include safeners and other ingredients are infrequently assessed for toxicity. Our goal was to understand the potential toxicity of safeners and herbicide + safener formulations relative to the toxicity of associated active ingredients. We quantified the concentration of safeners in commercially available formulations and tested effects on nontarget algae, Raphidocelis subcapitata, when exposed to individual herbicide active ingredients, safeners, and commercial formulations. The median effective concentrations (EC50s) causing 50% reduction in population growth for the herbicide active ingredients S-metolachlor and acetochlor were 0.046 and 0.003 ppm, respectively. The safeners benoxacor, AD-67, furilazole, and dichlormid were all substantially less toxic than the herbicides and were not toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations. The commercial formulations Dual II Magnum (R), Me-Too-Lachlor II (R), Harness (R), and Surpass EC (R) all resulted in EC50 values that fell within the 95% confidence interval of the associated active ingredient herbicide. Interestingly, a significant increase in cell size was observed when algae were exposed to all the formulations, herbicides (acetochlor and S-metolachlor), and safener (dichlormid). The safener furilazole caused a significant decrease in cell size, whereas benoxacor and AD-67 had no observed effect on algae cell size. Significant algae cell size effects all occurred at or above the EC50 concentrations for each chemical, suggesting that other morphological effects may be occurring.

The aim of this study was to compare the toxicity of commercially available household pesticides to that of the active ingredient(s) alone. The toxicity of five household pesticides (three herbicides and two insecticides) was investigated using a bacterial cytotoxicity bioassay and an algal photosynthesis bioassay. The commercial products were up to an order of magnitude more toxic than the active ingredient(s) alone. In addition, two commercial products with the same listed active ingredients in the same ratio had a 600 x difference in potency. These results clearly demonstrate that additives in commercial formulations are significant contributors to the toxicity of household pesticides. The toxicity of pesticides in aquatic systems is therefore likely underestimated by conventional chemical monitoring and risk assessment when only the active ingredients are considered. Regulators and customers should require more clarity from pesticide manufacturers about the nature and concentrations of not only the active ingredients, but also additives used in commercial formulations.

We evaluated the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of analytical standards and commercial formulations of atrazine (2 mu g L-1) and glyphosate (65 mu g L-1), isolated and in mixture (2 + 65 mu g L-1) on the microcrustacean Daphnia magna. Through chronic exposure (21 days) of two generations, we observed effects on survival, reproductive capacity and responses of the antioxidant defense system (catalase) and biotransformation system (glutathione S-transferase). The survival of organisms was affected in the second generation (F1) with a mortality of 17% in the mixture of commercial formulations treatments. In the evaluation of the first generation (F0) we observed only effects on sexual maturation of organisms, while in the F1, changes were observed in all parameters evaluated. A statistical difference (p < 0.05) was also observed between the analytical standards and the commercial formulations for all parameters evaluated, indicating that other components present in the formulations can change the toxicity of products. We suggest that atrazine can modulate toxicity when mixed with glyphosate, as the standard analytical atrazine and mixture of analytical standards results were similar in most parameters.

The sensitivity range of P. caudatum to reference substance sodium chloride was established. A preliminary risk assessment of diuron and carbofuran for Brazilian water bodies was performed. The tests indicated that toxicity of pure diuron and its commercial formulation was similar, while the commercial product carbofuran was more toxic than its pure form. In acute tests, readings were carried out at 2, 3, 4 and 6 h and showed an increase of mortality with increasing exposure time. The sensitivity of P. caudatum to NaCl ranged from 3.31 to 4.44 g L-1, averaging 3.88 g L-1. For diuron, the 6 h LC50 was 64.6 +/- 3.3 mg L-1 for its pure form and 62.4 +/- 2.5 mg L-1 for its commercial formulation. Carbofuran active ingredient was less toxic than that of diuron, presenting a 6 h LC50 of 142.0 +/- 2.4 mg L-1 for its pure form and 70.4 +/- 2.2 mg L-1 for its commercial product. Chronic tests showed that these pesticides cause significant decrease on population growth, generation number and biomass of P. caudatum.

The frequency of ME and other erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA, i.e., lobed nuclei, binucleates or segmented nuclei, kidney-shaped nuclei, notched nuclei, and picnotic nuclei) were evaluated and compared with positive (cyclophosphamide, CP, 40 mg/L) and negative (de-chlorinated tap water) controls. The results indicate that the exposure of R. arenarum tadpoles to LY (R) induces a concentration-dependent increase in ME frequency. The ENA frequency at 48 h was also significantly higher than that in the negative control group for all the chemicals assayed (CP, LY (R) and GLA) whereas at 96 h, increases in ENA over the negative control group were found only for CP and GLA (7.5 mg/L). Our study demonstrates that the commercial formulation of a GLA-based herbicide induces micronucleus formation in R. arenarum tadpoles, in contrast to the active ingredient. According to these results, the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation played an important role in the production of genotoxic damage in erythrocytes of amphibian tadpoles.

The method involved batch incubation of soils suspended with a commercial copper oxychloride-metalaxyl-based fungicide in 0.01 M CaCl2. Afterwards, the metalaxyl concentration remaining in solution was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The amount of dissolved metalaxyl in the fungicide suspension depends mainly on the soil pH, its potential acidity, and the cation exchange capacity. Of the approx. 20% metalaxyl retained by the solid colloids, the effect of organic matter colloids in soils (15-20 mg kg(-1)) had a poor contribution (six times lower) than the copper oxychloride colloids (40%, w/w)in the commercial fungicide formulation (100-130 mg kg(-1)). When comparing these retention data with the behaviour of metalaxyl used as a technical grade fungicide of about 100% purity (10-15 mg kg(-1) in solids), it is clear that the commercial formulation increases a 30% retention of metalaxyl by soil (15-20 mg kg(-1) in solids). The overall effect of the metalaxyl formulation plus soil show values of 10 times higher retention than technical grade-metalaxyl plus soil. Commercial formulation can decrease the mobility of soluble metalaxyl in agricultural soils with regard to the expected values obtained from batch studies using analytical grade-metalaxyl.

The new formulations were based on herbicide incorporation in phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles that were sorbed on the clay mineral montmorillonite. The active ingredient contents of the formulations reached up to 28% w:w. Thermal analysis revealed that the closely packed arrangement of PC on the clay enhanced diuron sorption by disrupting the interactions among PC molecules. Adsorption experiments using diuron were performed in soils with different physico-chemical properties to evaluate the relationship between the sorption and the mobility of the herbicide. In soil column experiments with sandy soil, the herbicide in PC-clay-based formulations mainly accumulated in the top soil, and there was a one-third reduction in leaching compared to the commercial formulation. The differences in leaching (compared to the commercial formulation) were lower when using loam soil due to its higher sorption of the herbicide and hysteresis effects. In the sandy soil, bioassay experiments showed a higher herbicidal activity in the top-soil layer for the PC-clay formulations than for the commercial formulation. Therefore, PC-clay formulations of this herbicide can be used at lower doses than recommended, thereby reducing the environmental risks associated with the application of diuron formulations.

Both enzymes were insensitive to pure carbofuran (1 mM), glyphosate (I mM) and malathion (120 muM). However, the carbamate carbofuran, in the commercial formulation Furandan 350S, inhibited ATPase and ChE activities. The organophosphate glyphosate used in the commercial preparation of Gliz 480CS(R) inhibited ATPase activity and increased cholinesterase activity. These effects are likely due to the action of adjuvant substances of the chemical formulation. The commercial formulation (Malatol 500CE) did not alter enzymes activities.

To do this, redox status, fatty acid (FA) profile, and histopathology aspects were assessed in the respiratory tree tissue of the sea cucumber Holothuria forskali following short-term exposure (96 h) to a series of concentrations (10, 100 and 1000 mu g L-1) of GLY and RD (R) (glyphosate acid equivalent). Our results showed that both GLY and RD (R) promoted oxidative stress highlighted with an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxides (LOOH) and advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) levels in all treated groups. In addition, both glyphosate forms were found to perturb the FA composition. However, changes in saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) including some essential FA (LA, ARA, EPA and DHA) revealed differential compensatory/adaptive processes in H. forskali depending on the treatment. GLY and RD (R) were also found to modulate the enzymatic (glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase and catalase) and non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid) antioxidant defense status. Taken together, our results revealed that the commercial formulation produced more pronounced effects on H. forskali respiratory tree than the pure form. This finding was further confirmed by the histological observations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2021,269,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.129376

Yet little is known about ecotoxicological effects on non-target benthic freshwater species exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IMI and its marketed products. The aim of the present study was to narrow this gap by assessing effects of pure IMI and its commercial formulation Confidor (R) on the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, a key species in freshwater sediments. To this end, we determined dose-response relationships in 24 h toxicity tests, bioconcentration during 24 h and 5 d of exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g IMI L-1, and physiological stress responses by measuring glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase activity in the same conditions. Maximum neonicotinoid concentrations reported from the field were lethal to L. variegatus within 24 h (LC50 of 65 and 88 mu g IMI L-1 in pure form and as active ingredient of Confidor (R), respectively). At sub-lethal exposure concentrations, tissue content of IMI significantly increased with exposure time. The observed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were far above the water octanol coefficient (K-OW), indicating a potentially large underestimation of IMI bioaccumulation when based on K-OW. Activities of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes indicated attempts of L. variegatus to counter xenobiotic-triggered oxidative stress to very low IMI and Confidor (R) concentrations. Together, our data add significantly to growing evidence that the continued proliferation of neonicotinoids require increased efforts in environmental risk assessment, especially in view of species-specific differences in sensitivities to the insecticide and possibly to additives of commercial formulations.

Aquatic ecosystems in the proximity of agricultural areas are particularly vulnerable to pesticides, which cause underperformance or extinction of non-target sensitive species. Once in the aquatic system, these chemicals can affect biological processes at multiple levels (molecular, individual, populational), causing ecosystem imbalance across multiple scales. In this study, the effect of a commercial formulation of a herbicide (Primextra (R) Gold TZ) and its main active ingredient (a.i., S-metolachlor) was studied on a freshwater cladoceran species (Daphnia longispina), at different levels of biological organization and temporal scales. S-metolachlor is used in many herbicide formulations applied in corn/maize cultures, which is a relevant culture worldwide. As a first step, the acute and chronic effects of both commercial formulation and a.i. were quantified, and both formulations negatively affected the cladoceran's survival and reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction, number of offspring and number of broods), as well as the population's rate of increase. Whilst acute effects were comparable, the commercial formulation was slightly more toxic (EC50 was two-times lower) than the a.i. in chronic exposures, being prejudicial to D. longispina populations above 4.0 mg/L of S-metolachlor. In a second experimental step, we focused on the potential multi-generational impacts of the exposure to the a.i. alone on biochemical (lipid biomarkers, namely fatty acids) and populational responses, because of the relevance of S-metolachlor as a biosynthesis inhibitor in many herbicidal formulations. The herbicide caused a significant decrease in Daphnia fecundity (in the size of the 1st clutch), but no concomitant alterations were found in fatty acid profiles of mothers or offspring. More important, this experiment showed that S-metolachlor did not cause effects in the subsequent generation, thus suggesting that biotic communities may recover after exposure to the xenobiotic.

The additives in commercial formulations of glyphosate, though labeled inert when used individually, have adverse effects when used in combination with other additives along with the active ingredient. As a species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a wide range of resistance to glyphosate-based herbicides. To investigate the underlying genetic differences between sensitive and resistant strains, global changes in gene expression were measured, when yeast were exposed to a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH). Expression of genes involved in numerous pathways crucial to the cell's functioning, such as DNA replication, MAPK signaling, meiosis, and cell wall synthesis changed. Because so many diverse pathways were affected, these strains were then subjected to in-lab-evolutions (ILE) to select mutations that confer increased resistance. Common fragile sites were found to play a role in adaptation to resistance to long-term exposure of GBHs. Copy number increased in approximately 100 genes associated with cell wall proteins, mitochondria, and sterol transport. Taking ILE and transcriptomic data into account it is evident that GBHs affect multiple biological processes in the cell. One such component is the cell wall structure which acts as a protective barrier in alleviating the stress caused by exposure to inert additives in GBHs. , a GPI-cell wall protein, plays an important role in tolerance of a GBH. Hence, a detailed study of the changes occurring at the genome and transcriptome levels is essential to better understand the effects of an environmental stressor such as a GBH, on the cell as a whole.",2020,10,2043,2056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/g3.120.401183

The AIs of thiamethoxam and imidacloprid, and their CFs (Actara and Confidor), having a nitroguanidine functional group, exhibited low persistence to photolysis. In contrast to them, thiacloprid and acetamiprid and their CFs (Calypso and Mospilan), containing a cyanoimine functional group, were stable during the UV irradiation period. As expected, the degradation rate of the studied neonicotinoids increased significantly in the combined action of UV radiation and H2O2. In the case of thiacloprid and acetamiprid and their CFs, the reaction of the OH radicals formed and molecules of these insecticides was the major destruction pathway. The increased photodegradation efficiency of the UV/7.2Fe/TiO2/H2O2 and vis/7.2Fe/TiO2/H2O2 processes was attributed to the surface photoreduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, which produces new OH radicals in the reaction with H2O2. In the presence of visible light, the efficiency may be partly due to the formation of the H2O2-TiO2 complexes. For the 7.2Fe/TiO2/H2O2 process in the presence of UV or visible radiation, no significant influence on the efficiency of photodegradation was observed in dependence of the structural differences of selected neonicotinoids. These results strongly suggest that highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, generated on the catalyst's surface in the reaction involving H2O2, are responsible for this oxidation. In order to investigate degree of mineralization for all insecticides, TOC measurements were also conducted. Also, it was observed that the removal of pure AIs and their CFs by dark adsorption was almost negligible.",2014,225,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-014-1954-5

All starch-encapsulated formulations were produced by twin screw extrusion technology and evaluated in two granule sizes, 1.4 to 0.5-mm (14 to 20 mesh) and 0.85 to 0.43-mm (20 to 40 mesh). Active ingredient rates applied were selected for the existing soil conditions and combination granules contained active ingredients proportional to premixed commercial formulations available or suggested for tank mixes. Evaluations were performed under conventional, chisel, and no-tillage systems. PRE and PPI applications of starch encapsulated two-component (atrazine-alachlor) in 1990 controlled giant foxtail (except at the low rate with large granule size), redroot pigweed, and common lambsquarters excellently but control of velvetleaf was fair to poor. Smaller-sized granules were generally more effective for controlling weeds than the larger-sized granules. In 199 1, starch-encapsulated two-component (atrazine-metolachlor) granules applied both PRE and PPI in conventional, chisel, and no-till systems gave results similar to 1990 with the small granules more effective on velvetleaf.

Here, we compared the toxicity of the herbicide Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate on survival, but also on ecologically relevant sublethal traits (life history, behaviour and physiology) in damselfly larvae. Roundup was more toxic than glyphosate with negative effects on survival, behaviour and most of the physiological traits being present at lower concentrations (food intake, escape swimming speed) or even only present (survival, sugar and total energy content and muscle mass) following Roundup exposure. This confirms the toxicity of the surfactant POEA. Notably, also glyphosate was not harmless: a realistic concentration of 2 mg/l resulted in reduced growth rate, escape swimming speed and fat content. Our results therefore indicate that the toxicity of Roundup cannot be fully attributed to its surfactant, thereby suggesting that also the new generation of glyphosate-based herbicides with other mixtures of surfactants likely will have adverse effects on non-target aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological studies comparing the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations typically ignore behaviour while the here observed differential effects on behaviour likely will negatively impact damselfly populations. Our data highlight that risk assessment of pesticides ignoring sublethal effects may contribute to the negative effects of pesticides on aquatic biodiversity.",2017,193,210,216,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.10.028

This study presents a pseudoternary phase diagram of the investigated system, at room temperature by titration, and the surfactant/cosurfactant mass ratios (S/C), the oil-to-surfactant/cosurfactant mass ratios (O/SC) and the optimum formulation. This study also investigates the continuous structural inversion from water-in-oil to oil-in-water microemulsions after dilution with the water phase. The electrical conductivities of the selected system at constant S/C (5:1) and O/SC (1:1.2) ratios with biodiesel were also studied, and the percolation phenomenon was observed. The study examines the performance and stability of a formulation with biodiesel in comparison to commercial formulations. Residue and phytotoxicity tests were carried out on cabbage plants in a greenhouse. Experimental results indicate that biodiesel has good handling characteristics when it forms a microemulsion. The microemulsion formulation, with biodiesel as a solvent, had an acceptable transparent appearance, broader transparency temperature range, and better performance and stability than the commercial formulation. Using biodiesel in a pesticide formulation had no adverse effects on the AI activity and is comparatively safe for crops and plants.",2012,51,4710,4718,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie201151p

Following questions yielding from a previous study, an in-depth analysis of the reproductive toxicity of the pesticide was made. Long-term exposures of Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina to Betanal (R) Expert, to each a.i. and to a customised mixture matching the a.i.s ratio within the commercial formulation were carried out, and deleterious effects in the offspring were recorded. This intended to clarify whether (1) the tested compounds induce reproductive injury; (2) there is interspecific variation in daphnids tolerance to the compounds; (3) there is an interaction between chemicals in combined treatments; and (4) the so-called inert ingredients added to the commercial formulation contribute to the toxicity of the herbicide. Generally, developmental impair was observed in both species (egg abortion and release of undeveloped embryos or dead offspring) at concentrations of any of the a.i.s below 1 mg L-1. Ethofumesate was invariably the least toxic pesticide, and D. magna tended to be of slightly higher sensitivity to the exposures compared to D. longispina. Joint exposures indicated that the a.i.s can interact, inducing more than and less than additive effects for Betanal (R) Expert and the customised a.i. mixture, respectively. This indicates that inert ingredients co-formulating the commercial pesticide (which are absent from the customised a.i. mixture) actually contribute to its overall toxicity. This study constitutes an add-on to the discussion on the ecotoxicological framework required for authorisation of pesticide trade and usage. The results support the need to consider test species, long-term hazardous potential and toxicity of commercial formulations rather than solely that of active ingredients, as relevant variables in pesticide regulation.",2016,23,13276,13287,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6492-9

To reduce herbicide leaching and increase weed control, we have developed, designed, and tested controlled release formulations (CRFs) for both herbicides based on their solubilizion in cationic micelles and adsorption of the mixed micelles (surfactant and herbicide) on a clay mineral, montmorillonite. A better understanding of solubilizing anionic (sulfentrazone) and nonionic (metolachlor) organic molecules in cationic micelles was reached. The percent of active ingredient in the formulations was much higher than previously designed CRFs due to the enhanced solubilization of the herbicides in the micelles and due to their adsorption on the clay. Both CRFs demonstrated controlled release (compared to the commercial formulations) when applied to a thin soil layer.

Log-phase cells were treated with 1.0-500.0 mu g/ml of the herbicides and harvested 24 h later for SCE and cell-cycle progression analyses. All concentrations assessed of both test compounds induced higher SCE frequencies over control values. SCEs increased in a non-dose-dependent manner neither for the pure compound (r = 0.48; P > 0.05) nor for the commercial formulation (r = 0.58, P > 0.05). For the 200.0 mu g/ml and 500.0 mu g/ml dicamba doses and the 500.0 mu g/ml banvel((R)) dose, a significant delay in the cell-cycle progression was found. A regression test showed that the proliferation rate index decreased as a function of either the concentration of dicamba (r= -0.98, P < 0.05) or banvel((R)) (r= -0.88, P < 0.01) titrated into cultures in the 1.0-500.0 mu g/ml dose-range. SCGE performed on CHO cells after a 90 min pulse-treatment of dicamba and banvel((R)) within a 50.0-500.0 mu g/ml dose-range revealed a clear increase in dicamba-induced DNA damage as an enhancement of the proportion of slightly damaged and damaged cells for all concentrations used (P < 0.01); concomitantly, a decrease of undamaged cells was found over control values (P < 0.01). In banvel((R))-treated cells, a similar overall result was registered.

Therefore, the objective of this work was to represent a realistic application scenario by evaluating the toxicity of environmental relevant and higher concentrations of a commercial formulation of MZ using zebrafish embryos. Following determination of the 96-h LC50 value, the embryos at the blastula stage (similar to 2 h post-fertilisation, hpf) were exposed to 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g L-1 of the active ingredient (similar to 40x lower than the 96-h LC50). During the exposure period (96 h), lethal, sublethal, and teratogenic parameters, as well as behaviour analysis, at 120 hpf, were assayed. Biochemical parameters such as oxidative stress-linked enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR)), reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and glutathione levels (GSH and GSSG), as well as the activity of degradation (glutathione S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase (CarE)), neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), and anaerobic respiration (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))-related enzymes, were analysed at the end of the exposure period. Exposed embryos showed a marked decrease in the hatching rate and many malformations (cardiac and yolk sac oedema and spinal torsions), with a higher prevalence at the highest concentration. A dose-dependent decreased locomotor activity and a response to an aversive stimulus, as well as a light-dark transition decline, were observed at environmental relevant concentrations. Furthermore, the activities of SOD and GR increased while the activity of GST, AChE, and MDA contents decreased. Taken together, the involvement of mancozeb metabolites and the generation of ROS are suggested as responsible for the developmental phenotypes. While further studies are needed to fully support the hypothesis presented, the potential cumulative effects of mancozeb-containing formulations and its metabolites could represent an environmental risk which should not be disregarded.",2020,27,21174,21187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08412-0

No relevant effects were observed for mepanipyrim except for glycerol production. On the contrary, in the presence of tetraconazole many genes and some proteins related to cell cycle progression and mitosis were repressed. This fact could explain the lower biomass concentration and the lower sugar consumption registered for tetraconazole at the end of the study. However, the biomass-to-ethanol yield was higher in connection with the overexpression of the ADH1 gene. The presence of tetraconazole residues seems to accelerate the Ehrlich pathway. These results agree with the overexpression of several genes (BAT1, PDC1, PDC5, ADH1, SFA1, ATF2, PFK1, PFK2 and ARO3) and a higher abundance of two proteins (Gap1p and Atf2p) involved in this metabolic pathway.",2020,92,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2020.103554

The in vivo assay comprised the exposure for 1 month to 3 mg/L of a commercial formulation containing 90% of atrazine as active ingredient (Gesaprim 90 WDG (R), Syngenta) on three categories of females: intact, ablated of one eyestalk, and ablated of both eyestalks. At the end of the assay, only the intact females showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in both content of vitellogenic ovarian proteins and proportion of vitellogenic oocytes, compared to a concurrent control.

Pesticides were selected to give a gradient of solubility in water between 7 and 93 mg L-1, comprising azoxystrobin (emulsifiable concentrate, EC, and suspension concentrate, SC), cyproconazole (SC), propyzamide (SC) and triadimenol (EC). Columns of sandy loam soil were leached with 6 pore volumes of 0.01 M CaCl2 either 1 or 7 days after treatment. Separate experiments evaluated leaching of triadimenol to full breakthrough following addition of 18 pore volumes of 0.01 M CaCl2. The mass of pesticide leached from columns treated with commercial formulation was significantly larger than that from-columns treated with technical material for all compounds studied and for both leaching intervals (two-sided t-tests, p < 0.001). This difference was conserved when triadimenol was leached to full breakthrough with 79 +/- 1.2 and 61 +/- 3.1% of applied triadimenol leached from columns treated with formulated and technical material, respectively. There were highly significant effects of formulation for all pesticides (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.001), whereas leaching interval was only significant for azoxystrobin EC formulation and cyproconazole (p < 0.001 and 0.021, respectively) with greater leaching when irrigation commenced 1 day after treatment. Leaching of azoxystrobin increased in the order technical material (6.0% of applied pesticide) < SC formulation (8.5-9.1% of applied) < EC formulation (15.8-21.0% of applied).

However, both the active ingredient and additives of the commercial formulations may adversely affect chemical and biological processes in soil. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of glyphosate and the commercial formulation (CH) on soil C, N and P dynamics, and microbial enzyme activity in two soil management conditions: a nopal plot (NP) with an history of 5 years of glyphosate application, and in an abandoned plot (AP) with a history of previous agricultural management without glyphosate applications. We performed three experiments: a) glyphosate and CH effects on phosphorus sorption by performing a non-biological P fixation experiment; b) glyphosate and CH effects on microbial activity, C, N and P dynamic, and the biodiversity of soil microorganisms in terms of biomarker fatty acids after a 27 day incubation experiment; and c) glyphosate and CH degradation was tested isolating bacteria from the incubated soil samples and growing in a defined media with potassium phosphate, glyphosate or CH as sole source of P. Our results suggested that other compounds from CH may be affecting P sorption, because when the herbicide was applied, P sorption was reduced in the NP, but in AP soil no significant effects were observed. In contrast, in the AP soil both glyphosate and the CH reduced C mineralization. Besides, CH application reduced Pmic concentration and laccase activity, but increased the specific activity of phosphonatase and phosphodiesterase in the AP soil. Additionally, the microbial community in NP soil revealed higher diversity index than the AP soil, but major changes in microbial groups were shown only when CH was applied. In vitro assay with native bacterial isolates confirmed their susceptibility to the commercial herbicide in both NP and AP soils. In conclusion, our results demonstrated changes on some processes related to soil C and P dynamics when pure glyphosate and a commercial glyphosate were applied, along with changes in microbial activity and community structure, being stronger the effects with the commercial formulation used. Further research should be done for test the effects of glyphosate on microbial stoichiometry and enzyme stoichiometry.",2022,169,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104256

An understanding of the interactions between clay minerals and organic molecules has yielded effective preparations of herbicide formulations. In most cases, binding the active ingredient to a suitable organoclay-based platform enhances activity by reducing migration of the herbicide to non-target depths, or by reducing degradation of the active ingredient. In this short communication, a formulation based on an organoclay and the herbicide acetochlor is compared with a commercial formulation. Efficiency was tested in two soils from the Hula Valley: a mineral, clay-based soil (with about 4 % organic matter) and a peat-derived soil with similar to 20 % organic matter. Although the soils were located only two kilometres apart, completely different herbicidal activity was observed. In the mineral soil, the organoclay formulation improved the behaviour of the herbicide and prevented its leaching; whereas in the peat-derived soil, the organoclay and commercial formulations behaved similarly, and were confined to the upper soil layer. In the latter case, the penetration depth of herbicide added in the organoclay formulation might be too shallow, resulting in poor herbicidal activity. The results of this study demonstrate differences that should be considered in weed control in drained peat soils.",2011,9,56,61,NA

Initially, all three amendments enhanced fluometuron degradation in soil treated with technical material or commercial formulation. Hairy vetch transiently enhanced degradation, while the two grass residues stimulated degradation during the entire study (60 d). Rice straw had the greatest stimulation.

Pesticide controlled-release formulations (CRFs) have attracted wide attention because they can control the rate of release of active ingredients and prolong the effective duration. In particular, nanoscale pesticide sustained-release systems have excellent biological activity and distribution performance because of their small particle size. Some technical difficulties remain in obtaining nanoscale CRFs. RESULTS We successfully fabricated pyraclostrobin nanosphere CRF by combining high-pressure homogenization technology and emulsion-solvent evaporation methods. The pyraclostrobin nanospheres had a uniform spherical shape with a mean particle size of 450 nm and polydispersity index of less than 0.3. The pyraclostrobin loading capacity reached 53.6%, with excellent storage stability. The contact angle of nanospheres on cucumber leaf surfaces demonstrated that it had good wettability. Compared with pyraclostrobin technical and commercial formulations, the nanosphere systems showed a significantly sustained release of pyraclostrobin for longer (up to 250 h). A preliminary bioassay against Penicillium ochrochloron showed that the bioactivity and long-term efficiency of pyraclostrobin nanospheres were superior to those of the commercial formulation. CONCLUSION This research introduced a simple, fast, expandable method for preparing pyraclostrobin nanospheres. The results showed that pyraclostrobin nanospheres could prolong the duration of pesticide efficacy and enhance bioactivity. Furthermore, this technology provides a platform for scale-up production of nano-scale pesticide CRFs.",2020,76,2829,2837,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5833

Eighteen isolates, belonging to the genera Azotobacter Azospirillum, Bacillus, Enterobacter Pseudomonas and Serratia, were exposed to four active compounds at concentration ranges similar to those in field soil. The sulfonylureas chlorsulfuron and rimsulfuron inhibited the growth of one of two Azospirillum and one of four Pseudomonas strains, while the imidazolinones imazapyr and imazethapyr were effective on two out of five Bacillus isolates. Surfactants in commercial formulation significantly enhanced rimsulfuron toxicity. With the exception of one Azospirillum strain, the differential tolerance of rhizobacteria to these herbicides was related to a differential sensitivity of their target, the activity of the first enzyme in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS). Greenhouse pot studies were performed to assess the occurrence of inhibitory effects on bacterial growth in field conditions. Maize seedlings were bacterized with the two strains which had shown in vitro sensitivity to sulfonylureas. Following the application to the soil of a commercial formulation of rimsulfuron at rates of 0, 0.2 and 0.5 mu mol a.i. kg(-1), significative differences in the resulting degree of bacterial root colonization were found. Moreover, upon co-inoculation with two strains, one tolerant and one sensitive to the herbicide, the presence of rimsulfuron significantly enhanced root occupancy by resistant bacteria, suggesting that shifts in the microbial community structure of crop rhizosphere could indeed result as a consequence of weed control by AHAS inhibitors.",1995,176,243,253,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011788

Soil-water partition tests on a commercial water-oil emulsion formulation of penconazole (WOEP) in 0.01 M CaCl2 containing 35 mg L-1 penconazole. incubated for 24h, showed a maximum retention of approximately 250-300 mg penconazole kg(-1) soil. Approximately 70% of the total penconazole retained by the solid phase was sorbed on the soil (175-200 mg kg(-1)). The other 30% was retained by the adjuvants present in the commercial formulation. The formulation also influenced the water-soil partition, increasing the sorption in tests on batch studies using technical-grade penconazole (TGP). Soils with high total copper and organic matter had the greatest affinity for penconazole when added as WOEP. Additionally, adsorption of penconazole followed an S-type isotherm, whose behavior was consistent with the ability of the technical-grade penconazole to form aggregates. In the case of the WOEP, the S-type behavior could be attributed to the surfactant present in the formulation, which could be adsorbed onto soil as hemimicelles, which in turn may facilitate adsorption of penconazole.

For this purpose, toxicity tests were performed with the single compounds (active ingredients and commercial formulations) and their combinations (only active ingredients). According to the results, the toxicity of active ingredients and their commercial formulations to R. subcapitata was similar. In the single exposures, both carbofuran and diuron inhibited significantly the it subcapitntn growth and caused physiological (chlorophyll a content) and morphological (complexity and cell size) changes in cells, as captured by flow cytometry single-cell properties. Regarding the mixture toxicity tests, data fitted to both reference models, concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA), and evidenced significant deviations. After the CA fitting, dose-ratio dependent deviation had the best fit to the data, demonstrating synergism caused mainly by diuron and antagonism caused mainly by carbofuran.

Human lymphocytes were treated for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 It with 0.047 mu g/ml, 0.47 mu g/ml, 4.7 mu g/ml of substances tested both in the presence and in the absence of an exogenous metabolic activator. Atrazine did not appear to be genotoxic or to be capable of inducing apoptosis or necrosis. Unlike atrazine, Gesaprime (R) and the adjuvant mixture increased DNA damage in lymphocytes. After 5 h of treatment, it also increased the number of apoptotic cells. Metabolic activation additionally enhanced the DNA-damaging potential of Gesaprim (R) and the adjuvant mixture but did not affect atrazine genotoxicity. Thus, both assay endpoints differed significantly for the active ingredient and formulation. To evaluate the potential health risk of simultaneous exposure to adjuvants and an active ingredient, further efforts using a biomonitoring approach should be made. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore investigated and compared the mechanisms underlining the nephrotoxicity of Roundup herbicide and glyphosate alone in rat. Fifty-six adult male rats randomized into 7 groups of 8 rats per group were exposed to Roundup formulation and glyphosate alone daily by gavage at 3.6, 50.4, and 248.4 mg/kg body weight (bw) of glyphosate concentrations for 12 weeks with distilled water administered to the control group. Kidney biomarker (serum urea and creatinine, plasma cystatin-C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), oxidative stress indices in the kidney tissue, activities of kidney membrane-bound enzymes (Mg-adenosine triphosphatase [ATPase], Ca-ATPase, Na/K-ATPase, and total ATPase), and histopathological changes in the kidney were monitored. Glyphosate concentration in the kidney was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Significant (P < 0.05) alterations in the levels of the kidney biomarker, oxidative stress markers, and membrane-bound enzymes were observed in the rats exposed to Roundup compared to the rats exposed to glyphosate alone. Rats exposed to Roundup accumulated more glyphosate residue in their kidney tissue. Severe histopathological lesions were only seen in the kidneys of rats exposed to Roundup. The nephrotoxicity observed cannot be due to the active ingredient in the Roundup formulation, as glyphosate alone has virtually no effect on the renal function of the exposed animals. Therefore, the general claim attributing nephrotoxicity of a glyphosate-based herbicide to its active ingredient should be discouraged.",2018,37,285,295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1091581818779553

These substances are potentially toxic pollutants because they induce the production of reactive oxygen species for biological systems and exert oxidative stress in nontarget organisms living in the treated aquatic systems. Recent evidence suggests differences in the toxicity of glyphosate in the form of an active ingredient compared to the toxicity of glyphosate in combination with surfactants, such as those found in commercial formulations. In Mexico, one of the most widely used glyphosate-based herbicides is Yerbimat, which has agricultural as well as aquatic weed control applications. However, there are no aquatic toxicity data, particularly regarding native fish. Therefore, we determined the acute toxicity of commercial-formulation Yerbimat in a static bioassay at 96 h (LC50). We also determined its toxicity at 96 h in sublethal concentrations to assess the lipid peroxidation levels (LPX), catalase activity, hepatic glycogen content, and histological damage in the liver and gills of the fish Goodea atripinnis associated with chronic exposure (75 days). The LC50 was 38.95 +/- 0.33 mg/L. The results of the short-term exposure study indicate that Yerbimat can potentially induce oxidative stress in G. atripinnis, because LPX was increased in the gills and liver. Catalase activity was reduced in the gills but increased in the liver, whereas hepatic glycogen was depleted. Chronic exposure was associated with histopathological damage in the gills and liver, some of which was irreversible. Yerbimat represents a potential risk for aquatic biota; therefore, we recommend that its application be carefully considered.",2011,61,443,452,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-011-9648-0

The evidence was obtained from field and in vitro trials. In the field trial, cattle infested with ticks was treated with two commercial formulations of fluazuron. The in vitro trial (adult immersion test, AIT) was performed by using technical grade fluazuron. In the field trial, there were no significant differences between the treated and control groups between days 2 and 34 post-treatment. The only exceptions (treated group I in day 14 post-treatment, treated group II in days 23 and 29 post-treatment) had a significantly lower tick load than the untreated group, but the efficacy was not higher than 70%. Viable engorged females were collected on both groups of treated bovines in all counts, and the production of viable larvae was not precluded with the application of the two commercial formulations of fluazuron evaluated in this study. The results obtained with the in vitro assay (AIT) also indicate that the R. microplus population tested in this work has a higher level of resistance to fluazuron than another susceptible field strain. The integrated analysis of the field and in vitro trials clearly reveals the emergence of resistance to fluazuron in a R. microplus population from Argentina. This diagnosis of resistance does not imply that the fluazuron has lost its functionality at a regional scale, but it highlights the need to establish control strategies that minimize the use of this drug in order to preserve its functionality as an acaricide.",2022,86,599,606,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-022-00713-y

Cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) and MTT assays as well as Neutral Red uptake were employed for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity evaluation. Activities were tested within the concentration range of 0.25-15 mu g/ml S-metolachlor for 24h of exposure. Both compounds rendered a minor reduction in the NDI although not reaching statistical significance. Results demonstrated that the S-metolachlor was not able to induce MNs. On the other hand, 0.5-6 mu g/ml Twin Pack Gold increased the frequency of MNs. When cytotoxicity was estimated, S-metolachlor was not able to induce either a reduction of lysosomal or mitochondrial activity.

Nanopesticides represent an emerging technological tool that offers a range of benefits including increased efficacy, durability, and reduction in the amounts of used active ingredients. However, due to the lack of studies on the toxicity and the sublethal effects on pests and natural enemies, the extent of action and fate of these nanopesticdes is still not fully understood limitting thus their wide use. In this study, we encapsulated the pirimicarb insecticide using nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and investigated the toxicity and sublethal effects (LC25) of the resulting nanocapsules against the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (Linnaeus) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and its natural enemy the green lacewings Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae). Nanoencapsulation of pirimicarb enhanced 12.6-fold its toxicity to cabbage aphids compared to its commercial formulation. Furthermore, analysis of the age-stage, two-sex life table showed that negative effects on the B. brassicae aphid population growth were observed on F0 and F1 generations when aphids of parental (F0) generation were exposed to subelethal dose (LC25) of both formulations of pirimicarb. However, negative effects from sublethal exposure to the commercial and nanoformulated pirimicarb resulted in significant reduction on the net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of natural increase, and finite rate of increase of the green lacewings C. carnea.

All these factors have encouraged the development of controlled release formulations (CRFs), which can reduce herbicides levels in the environment since less active ingredient need to be applied for maintaining the herbicidal efficacy. For soil applied herbicides. such as alachlor and norflurazon, the residual weed control is dependent on herbicide persistence and availability in soil. The present study describes the preparation, characterization and application to soil of CRFs containing the herbicides norflurazon and alachlor. Ethylcellulose formulations were obtained by a microencapsulation technique. The results of the in vitro release studies in water showed that a prolonged release of the herbicides to solution was successfully achieved by using ethylcellulose microspheres.

Basal acetylcholinesterase activity in soft tissues and hemolymph was almost one order of magnitude higher in P. corneus than in B. glabrata. However, upon chlorpyrifos exposure, statistically significant inhibition of enzymatic activity was registered in both species. Acetylcholinesterase was more sensitive to inhibition in soft tissues than in hemolymph. The highest inhibition was observed in the B. glabrata soft tissues exposed to the commercial formulation (88 % at 1 mu g L-1 and 93 % at 7.5 mu g L-1).

Therefore, glyphosate residues have been detected in water and soils near the application sites. Recent studies indicate that GBH may cause adverse effects on vertebrates although these have been attributed to the presence of adjuvants in the commercial formulations rather than to the sole compound. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to investigate the lethal and sub-lethal developmental effects, neurotoxic potential and oxidative stress responses of zebrafish embryos to Roundup (R) Ultramax (RU) exposure. Embryos were exposed during 72 h to 0, 2, 5, 8.5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) of RU. Increased mortality was observed in embryos exposed to concentrations above 8.5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) as well as increased number of malformations. Decreased heart rate and hatchability were also observed. By contrast, exposure to concentrations that do not evoke teratogenic outcomes induced a dose-dependent decrease of heart rate although not inducing significant developmental changes. However, histological changes were not observed in the larvae exposed to these concentrations. Moreover, the generation of reactive oxygen species, the antioxidant enzymes activities (SOD and CAT), the GST biotransformation activity, the glutathione levels (GSH and GSSG), the oxidative damage (MDA) and the acetylcholinesterase and lactate dehydrogenase were similar among groups following exposure.

This study evaluated a combination of pesticide and biodiesel that is nontoxic and biodegradable to overcome various problems with aromatic solvents. A 40.8% chlorpyrifos EC formulation was prepared by blending with biodiesel, cosolvent and surfactants and compared with a commercial product with only aromatic solvent as the carrier. Several physical and chemical tests were processed to compare these two formulations. Residual and phytotoxicity tests were performed with cabbage plants in a greenhouse. The experimental results revealed no considerable difference between the biodegradable and commercial formulations in stability tests. The results also indicated that the 40.8% chlorpyrifos EC prepared with biodiesel was up to grade. In addition, biodiesel can reduce the unpleasant odor that is generated from chlorpyrifos because of its low volatility. The high flash point of biodiesel enabled safer storage, transportation, and application of the formulation. According to the findings from residual experiments, biodiesel may increase the amount of active ingredient (AI) on the surface of plants because of its lipophilic characteristic, which enabled more effective pest controlling of the pesticide delivery system. In the phytotoxicity test, the use of biodiesel as the carrier did not harm plants in any application ratios and may reduce environmental risks. Therefore, for oil-soluble AIs, biodiesel may be a suitable alternative carrier for EC formulations. In contrast to commercial formulations, the use of biodiesel may help to reduce the dosage, cost of food production and adverse effects. Biodiesel may also provide added value, be environmentally friendly, and less hazardous. Therefore, biodiesel is an advantageous carrier to deliver AIs and to improve their performance.

In field trials the active ingredient (a.i.) decay had a half-life time of 0.8 days, which was too short to show a good efficacy of treatment. The mechanism of disappearance of the pesticide studied with model systems showed that it was unrelated to evaporation, thermodegradation, and co-distillation, but it was related to photodegradation.

A closely related compound, 5b-hydrochlordecone (5b-hydroCLD), has been searched for and often detected in environmental matrices from the geographical area where CLD was applied. The current consensus considered that its presence was not the result of a biotic or abiotic dechlorination of CLD in these matrices but rather the consequence of its presence as impurity (synthesis by-product) in the CLD released into the environment. The aim of the present study was to determine if and to what extent degradation of CLD into 5b-hydroCLD occurred in the field. To test this hypothesis, the ratios of 5b-hydroCLD and CLD concentrations in a dataset of 810 soils collected between 2006 and 2012 in Martinique were compared to the ratios measured in 3 samples of the CLD dust commercial formulations applied in the banana fields of French West Indies (FWI) and 1 sample of the technical-grade CLD corresponding to the active ingredient used in such formulations. Soil data were processed with a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for random measurement errors and data censoring. Any pathway of CLD transformation into 5b-hydroCLD occurring over the long term in FWI soils would indeed change the ratio of 5b-hydroCLD/CLD compared to what it was in the initially applied formulations. Results showed a significant increase of the 5b-hydroCLD/CLD ratio in the soils-25 times greater in soil than in commercial formulations-which suggested that natural CLD transformation into 5b-hydroCLD over the long term occurred in these soils.

However, the decrease of bee's population has been observed worldwide and besides other factors, this collapse is also related to the extensive use of pesticides. In this sense, studies involving the assessment of adverse effects and the uptake of pesticides by bees are of great concern. This work presents an analytical method for the determination of the insecticide abamectin and the fungicide difenoconazole in the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris exposed via oral and topic to endpoints concentrations of active ingredients (a.i.) alone and in commercial formulations and the discussion about its mortality and uptake. For this purpose, QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Efficient, Rugged and Safe) acetate modified method was used for extraction and pesticides were determined by LC-MS/MS. The validation parameters have included: a linear range between 0.01 and 1.00 mu g mL(-1); and LOD and LOQ of 0.038 and 0.076 mu g g(-1) for abamectin and difenoconazole, respectively. The uptake of tested pesticides via oral and topic was verified by the accumulation in adult forager bees, mainly when the commercial product was tested. Mortality was observed to be higher in oral exposure than in topic tests for both pesticides. For abamectin in a commercial formulation (a.i.) no differences were observed for oral or topic exposure. On the other hand, for difenoconazole, topic exposure had demonstrated higher accumulation in bees, according to the increase of received dose. Through the results, uptake and the possible consequences of bioaccumulated pesticides are also discussed and can contribute to the knowledge about the risks involving the exposure of bees to these compounds.

Due to its high toxicity to non -target animals, its persistence in the environment and its ability to act as an endocrine disrupting compound in fish, ES use is currently banned or restricted in many other countries. Previous studies on the cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus have shown that waterborne exposure to ES can lead to both decreased pituitary FSH content and histological alterations of testes. As gonadotropin-stimulated sex steroids release from gonads was inhibited by ES in vitro, the aim of the present study was to elucidate possible mechanisms of disruption of ES on gonadal steroidogenesis in C. dimerus, as well as compare the action of the active ingredient (AI) with that of currently used commercial formulations (CF). Testis and ovary fragments were incubated with ES (AI or CF) and/or steroidogenesis activators or precursors. Testosterone and estradiol levels were measured in the incubation media. By itself, ES did not affect hormone levels. Co-incubation with LH and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin caused a decrease of the stimulated sex steroids release. When co-incubated with precursors dehydroandrostenedione and 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone, ES did not affect the increase caused by their addition alone. No differences were observed between the Al and CFs, suggesting that the effect on steroidogenesis disruption is mainly caused by the Al. Results indicate that action of ES takes place downstream of LH-receptor activation and upstream of the studied steroidogenic enzymes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, concerns have arisen about its harmful side effects for both ecosystems and wildlife health. Therefore, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of a commercial formulation of glyphosate (RoundUp (R) UltraMax), at environmentally relevant concentrations on zebrafish embryos through a set of behavioural patterns. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 1, 2 and 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) concentrations of the glyphosate formulation for 72 h (from 2.5 to 75 h post-fertilization (hpf)). After exposure, larvae were washed and allowed to develop until 144 hpf. At this point, the larvae behaviour was evaluated using a battery of tests to assess the general exploratory motility, escape-like responses, anxiety-related behaviours and social interactions. In addition, cortisol levels were assessed. No significant changes were observed relative to the exploratory behaviour in the standard open field. The anxiety-related behaviours were similar among groups, and no social interference was observed following exposure to these glyphosate concentrations. Likewise, cortisol levels remained similar among treatments. Still, the larvae exposed to 5 mu g a.i. mL(-1) did not react to the presence of an aversive stimulus, supporting glyphosate-induced changes in the sensory- motor coordination during development. In general, these results indicate a possible neurotoxic effect of this glyphosate-based formulation that should be further evaluated. In addition, the results obtained could impose a risk for wildlife sensitive species that should not be neglected. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

While contrasting results have been observed related with its impact on soil microbial communities, more studies are necessary to elucidate the potential effects of the herbicide. Differences in tolerance detected by Pollution Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) approach could reflect these effects. The objective of the present study was to assess the tolerance to glyphosate (the active ingredient and a commercial formulation) of contrasting soils with (H) and without (NH) history of exposure. The hypothesis of a higher tolerance in H soils due to a sustained selection pressure on community structure was tested through the PICT approach. Results indicated that tolerance to glyphosate is not consistent with previous history of exposure to the herbicide either for the active ingredient or for a commercial formulation. Soils of H and NH sites were also characterized in order to determine to what extent they differ in their functional diversity and structure of microbial communities. Denaturant Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and Quantitative Real Time PCR (Q-PCR) indicated high similarity of Eubacteria profiles as well as no significant differences in abundance, respectively, between H and NH sites. Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) indicated some differences in respiration of specific sources but functional diversity was very similar as reflected by catabolic evenness (E). These results support PICT assay, which ideally requires soils with differences in their exposure to the contaminant but minor differences in other characteristics.

Total elimination of methidathion can be achieved in less than 2 h of irradiation, although longer solar exposures are needed for complete mineralisation of the solution (7-8 h). Activated sludge respirometry shows that when methidathion is eliminated, the solution is detoxified, so further irradiation does not seem necessary. A Zahn-Wellens test also indicates improved biodegradability of the treated sample after abatement of the active ingredient.

Although there has been considerable research on pollinator exposure and aquatic toxicological effects, few studies have investigated the chronic impacts on soil-dwelling species. Given the application of neonicotinoids into soil systems, there is the potential for risk to soil invertebrates. The toxicity of 2 commercial formulations containing the active ingredients (a.i.) thiamethoxam (Actara 240SC) or clothianidin (Titan (TM)) was investigated using 3 soil invertebrate species: Oppia nitens, Eisenia andrei, and Folsomia candida. No adverse effects were observed for O. nitens at the highest tested concentrations (>= 92 mg a.i./kg dry soil) after a 28-d exposure. Exposure to clothianidin resulted in a 28-d median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.069 (95% confidence limits: 0.039-0.12) mg/kg dry soil for F. candida, and a 56-d IC50 of 0.26 (0.22-3.2) mg a.i./kg dry soil for E. andrei. Exposure to thiamethoxam was less toxic, with IC50s of 0.36 (0.19-0.66) and 3.0 (2.2-4.0) mg a.i./kg dry soil for F. candida and E. andrei reproduction, respectively. The observed toxicity for F. candida adult survival and reproduction and for E. andrei reproduction occurred at environmentally relevant concentrations. However, because clothianidin is a degradation product of thiamethoxam, and detection of clothianidin rose to levels of concern in the thiamethoxam-amended soils over time, the observed toxicity may be partly attributed to the presence of clothianidin.

Knowledge about their environmental behaviour is however scarce, which impedes the assessment of the new risk and benefits relative to currently used agrochemicals. With the aim to advance our understanding of the fate of nanopesticides in the environment and support the development of robust exposure assessment procedures, the main objectives of the study were to (i) investigate the extent to which three nanoformulations can affect the photodegradation and sorption of the insecticide clothianidin, and (ii) evaluate various approaches to estimate durability, a key parameter for the exposure assessment of nanopesticides. The nanoformulations increased the photodegradation half-life in water by a maximum of 21% relative to the conventional formulation. Sorption to soil was investigated by two methods and over time, and results show that sorption was increased by up to 51% and 10%, relative to unformulated clothianidin and the commercial formulation, respectively. Our results generally indicate that nanoformulations may have a greater impact on the fate of pesticide active ingredients than commercial formulations. It is important to note however that differences in fate parameters were generally very moderate, including in realistic worst-case conditions (high pesticide concentration and ionic strength). Our results collectively suggest that clothianidin was rapidly released from the nanocarrier systems and that the durability of the three nanoformulations would be short in water as well as in soil environments (including under realistic soil to solution ratio). The durability of nanoformulations after their application in the environment is an essential parameter that needs to be characterised for the development as well as for the evaluation of nano-enabled agrochemicals. This study illustrates how performances of nano-enabled products can be critically benchmarked against existing products to support an objective assessment of new environmental risks and benefits. In this context, the fate of the nanocarrier system is of great interest and should be the topic of further research.",2018,5,882,889,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8en00038g

The use of pesticides contaminates the aquatic environment, threatening biodiversity and non-target organisms such as fish. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute exposure for 96 h hours to atrazine and diuron commercial formulations in zebrafish (Danio rerio, wild-type AB) embryos and larvae and adult stages. We observed a significant concentration-dependent survival decrease and hatching delays in animals exposed to both herbicides and in the frequency of malformations compared to the control groups. Morphological defects included cardiac edema, tail reduction, and head malformation. At 7 days post-fertilization (dpf), atrazine exposure resulted in a reduction in the head length at 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L and increased the ocular distance at 1, 2, 2.5, and 5 mg/L atrazine when compared to controls. At the same age, diuron increased the ocular distance in animals exposed to diuron (1.0 and 1.5 mg/L) and no effects were observed on the head length. We also evaluated a behavioral repertoire in larvae at 7 dpf, and there were no significant differences in distance traveled, mean speed, time in movement, and thigmotaxis for atrazine and diuron when animals were individually placed in a new environment. The cognitive ability of the larvae was tested at 7 dpf for avoidance and optomotor responses, and neither atrazine nor diuron had significant impacts when treated groups were compared to their corresponding controls. Adults' behavior was evaluated 7 and 8 days after the end of the acute herbicide exposure. Exploration of a new environment and associated anxiety-like parameters, social interaction, and aggressiveness were not altered.

In addition, experiments without fungicides were developed for comparative purposes. Proteome profiles of yeasts cultured in the presence or absence of fungicide molecules were different. Independently of the fungicide treatment applied, the highest variations concerning the control sample were observed for those proteins involved in metabolic processes, especially in the metabolism of nitrogen compounds. Tetraconazole molecules altered the abundance of several enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, and ergosterol. Moreover, differences in the abundance of several enzymes of the TCA cycle were found. Changes observed were different between the active substance and the commercial formulation. Significance: The presence of fungicide residues in grape juice has direct implications on the development of the aromatic profile of the wine. These alterations could be related to changes in the secondary metabolism of yeasts. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the response of yeasts to fungicide residues remains quite unexplored.

Amino acids are precursors of some important higher alcohols and ethyl acetates (such as methionol, 2-phenylethanol, isoamyl alcohol or 2-phenylacetate).

The analyte was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UVD) and confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) in the select ion-monitoring mode. The mean recoveries ranged from 75.34 to 98.00% and 96.95 to 100.97%, with relative standard deviations of 0.86-4.14 and 1.22-3.52%, in samples treated with and without additional column clean-up procedures, respectively. The minimum detectable amount of imidacloprid was 4 ng, while the limits of detection and quantitation were 0.2 and 0.5 ppm, respectively. The degradation of pesticide was monitored throughout a period of 13 days under greenhouse conditions. Although the behaviors of the EC and WP formulations appear to be similar, the absolute residue levels obtained with EC and WP treatments differed slightly. When imidacloprid formulations were applied (as foliar treatments) according to the recommended rate, the final residues (13 days post-treatment) in Chinese cabbage were much lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL = 3.5 ppm) established by the Korean Food and Drug Administration. Taken together, our study suggests that the analysis of imidacloprid can be performed without an additional column clean-up procedure, and the decline curve and the residue levels in Chinese cabbage could change if the same active ingredient is used in different formulations.

To test the acute effects of both glyphosate and a commercial formulation of Roundup (hereafter Roundup), we conducted a series of exposure experiments with different clones and age-classes of D. magna. The results demonstrated EC50 (48) values in the low ppm-range for Roundup as well as for the active ingredient (a.i.) isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (glyphosate IPA) alone. Roundup showed slightly lower acute toxicity than glyphosate IPA alone, i.e. EC50 values of 3.7-10.6 mg a.i./l, as compared to 1.4-7.2 mg a.i./l for glyphosate IPA. However, in chronic toxicity tests spanning the whole life-cycle, Roundup was more toxic. D. magna was exposed to sublethal nominal concentrations of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l for 55 days. Significant reduction of juvenile size was observed even in the lowest test concentrations of 0.05 mg a.i./l, for both glyphosate and Roundup. At 0.45 mg a.i./l, growth, fecundity and abortion rate was affected, but only in animals exposed to Roundup. At 1.35 and 4.05 mg a.i./l of both glyphosate and Roundup, significant negative effects were seen on most tested parameters, including mortality. D. magna was adversely affected by a near 100 % abortion rate of eggs and embryonic stages at 1.35 mg a.i./l of Roundup. The results indicate that aquatic invertebrate ecology can be adversely affected by relevant ambient concentrations of this major herbicide. We conclude that glyphosate and Roundup toxicity to aquatic invertebrates have been underestimated and that current European Commission and US EPA toxicity classification of these chemicals need to be revised.",2013,22,251,262,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-012-1021-1
129,Cecylia,not vetted,"Mesnage, R; Antoniou, MN",Ignoring Adjuvant Toxicity Falsifies the Safety Profile of Commercial Pesticides,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,"Commercial formulations of pesticides are invariably not single ingredients. Instead they are cocktails of chemicals, composed of a designated pesticidal active principle and other ingredients, with the latter collectively also known as adjuvants. These include surfactants, antifoaming agents, dyes, etc. Some adjuvants are added to influence the absorption and stability of the active principle and thus promote its pesticidal action. Currently, the health risk assessment of pesticides in the European Union and in the United States focuses almost exclusively on the stated active principle. Nonetheless, adjuvants can also be toxic in their own right with numerous negative health effects having been reported in humans and on the environment. Despite the known toxicity of adjuvants, they are regulated differently from active principles, with their toxic effects being generally ignored. Adjuvants are not subject to an acceptable daily intake, and they are not included in the health risk assessment of dietary exposures to pesticide residues. Here, we illustrate this gap in risk assessment by reference to glyphosate, the most used pesticide active ingredient. We also investigate the case of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are strongly suspected to be involved in bee and bumblebee colony collapse disorder. Authors of studies sometimes use the name of the active principle (for example glyphosate) when they are testing a commercial formulation containing multiple (active principle plus adjuvant) ingredients. This results in confusion in the scientific literature and within regulatory circles and leads to a misrepresentation of the safety profile of commercial pesticides. Urgent action is needed to lift the veil on the presence of adjuvants in food and human bodily fluids, as well as in the environment (such as in air, water, and soil) and to characterize their toxicological properties. This must be accompanied by regulatory precautionary measures to protect the environment and general human population from some toxic adjuvants that are currently missing from risk assessments.",2018,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00361

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the toxicity of glyphosate, its by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and two commercial formulations, Roundup Express (R) (R-EX) and Roundup Allees et Terrasses (R) (R-AT), containing glyphosate as the active ingredient, on the early life stages of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The embryotoxicity of these chemicals were quantified by considering both the rates of abnormalities and the arrested development or types of abnormalities in D-shaped larvae after 48 h exposure. The success of metamorphosis was examined in pediveliger larvae exposed for 24 h. Experiments involving both endpoints included range finding experiments for herbicide concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100,000 mu g L-1. This range was then narrowed down in order to determine precise EC50 values. Actual concentrations of the herbicide were determined at the beginning and after 48 h (embryotoxicity) and 24 h (metamorphosis) to evaluate the potential temporal variation in the concentrations. During embryo-larval development, no mortalities were recorded at any of the concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA, whereas no embryos or D-shaped larvae could be observed after exposure to 10,000 mu g L-1 of R-EX or R-AT. Compared with the controls, no effects on embryo-larval development were recorded between 0.1 and 1000 mu g L-1, regardless of the chemical tested. Above a threshold, which varied according to the chemical used, the gradient of herbicide concentrations correlated with a gradient of severity of abnormality ranging from normal larvae to arrested development (an old embryo stage). The EC50 values were 28,315 and 40,617 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and its metabolite, respectively, but much lowered values of 1133 and 1675 mu g L-1 for R-EX and R-AT, respectively. Metamorphosis tests also revealed a significant difference between molecules, as the EC50 values exceeded 100,000 mu g L-1 for glyphosate and AMPA but were as low as 6366 and 6060 mu g L-1 for the commercial formulations, which appeared relatively more toxic. Overall, the embryo-larval development of C. gigas was more sensitive to glyphosate-based herbicides compared to various endpoints studied in regulatory model organisms, and embryos and D-shaped larvae were more sensitive compared to pediveliger larvae.

The release of active ingredient from BPCs was significantly lower as compared to commercial metribuzin formulation. The results revealed that the cumulative metribuzin release was highest (81%) from the BPCs containing 8% clay (commercial bentonite) and 2% metribuzin which correspond to the lowest (14 days) half-life values i.e., time required for 50% release of active ingredient (t(1/2)). The metribuzin release from the BPCs decreased with increased concentration of clays in polymer matrix and the release was further decreased with BPCs prepared with pure nano-bentonite. BPCs containing 12% clay and 2% metribuzin showed maximum t(1/2) values i.e., 25 and 51 days for commercial bentonite and pure nano-bentonite as clay sources, respectively. The differential behaviour in the metribuzin release rates from BPCs was ascribed due to variations in crosslinking of metribuzin in the composites.

In developing countries such as Mali, a neem seed water extract is prepared by soaking ground seeds in water for three or seven days. The aim of this study was to check the effectiveness of this extract in terms of azadirachtin A extraction yield and insecticidal activity. The yield of extraction was 019 g azadirachtin A/100 g seeds. The concentration of azadirachtin A in the seed extract was approximately 200 mg l(-1), eight times higher than the recommended concentration of commercial products (25 mg l(-1)). A comparison of the extractive capacity of different solvents indicated that the best solvents were water and methanol. The azadirachtin A concentration declined in extracts stored for more than 3 days at a temperatures higher than 30 degrees C. Bioassays were performed on target insects (the leafhopper Macrosteles quadripunctulatus, the moth Spodoptera littoralis and the tobacco whitefly Bemisia tabaci) in order to compare the insecticidal activity of the neem extract with that of the commercial product Neemazal T/S and of a solution of pure azadirachtin A. The bioassays conducted on the leafhopper and the moth demonstrated that the neem extract at the recommended concentration (25 mg l(-1) active ingredient) was as effective as the azadirachtin-based commercial product at the same concentration, while for the control of the whitefly B. tabaci a higher concentration of the water extract was needed.

Still, adverse environmental and human health effects resulting from its application have been reported. In this study, the possibility of readjusting the formulation of a commercial product combining azoxystrobin and tebuconazole (active ingredients - AIs; Custodia (R)) towards environmentally safer alternative(s) was investigated. Specifically, the sensitivity of non-target aquatic communities to each AI was first evaluated by applying the Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) approach. Then, mixtures of these AIs were tested in a non-target organism (Raphidocelis subcapitata) denoting sensitivity to both AIs as assessed from SSDs. The resulting data supported the design of the last stage of this study, where mixtures of those AIs at equivalent vs. alternative ratios and rates as in the commercial formulation were tested against two target fungal species: Pyrenophora teres CBS 123929 and Rhynchosporium secalis CBS 110524. The comparison between the sensitivity of non-target aquatic species and the corresponding efficacy towards target fungi revealed that currently applied mixture and rates of these AIs are generally environmentally safe (antagonistic interaction; concentrations below the EC1 for R. subcapitata and generally below the HC5 for aquatic non-target communities), but ineffective against target organisms (maximum levels of inhibition of 70 and 50% in P. teres CBS 123929 and R. secalis CBS 110524, respectively). Results additionally suggest a potentiation of the effects of the AIs by the other formulants added to the commercial product at tested rates.

Surfactants are used as activators in commercial formulations of many herbicides to improve their foliar absorption and ultimate biological activity. Current views on their influence are considered in relation to surface phenomena, solubilisation of non-polar active ingredients, wax dissolution, cuticle penetration, preferential sites of penetration, membrane permeability and possible systemicity. The importance of a number of moderating factors (plant, chemical and environmental) is discussed in the light of current work, with particular regard to herbicide polarity, surfactant type, Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance and critical micelle concentration. Current studies on the influence of nonionic polyoxyethylene surfactants of differing ethylene oxide (EO) content have underlined the importance of EO number to their activity.",1993,38,93,102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2780380205

This study aimed to assess the adverse effects of the commercial formulation of the aquatic herbicide, Reward (R), on the Pacific Northwest amphibian species, the northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile). Larvae were exposed to the Reward (R) herbicide in a 96-h acute bioassay (0.37-151.7 mg/L DB) and a continuous 21-day exposure (0.37-94.7 mg/L DB). The 96-h LC50 was 71.5 mg/L and the 21-day LC50 was 1.56 mg/L. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that early life stage A. gracile larvae appear largely insensitive to acute Reward (R) exposures compared to early life stage fish. However, A. gracile larvae are considerably more sensitive during sub-chronic exposure (21 days) with lethal and sub-lethal effects on growth occurring in the 1-2 mg/L range, which more closely resembles the larval fish lethal sensitivity to this active ingredient. This is the first study examining the toxicity of the aquatic herbicide formulation Reward (R) on A. gracile under acute and sub-chronic exposure scenarios.",2019,26,31077,31085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06234-3

However one should verify the loss of residues in the period from the discovery of the dead honeybees to their analysis. Since honey bee mortalities due to neonicotinoid insecticides have been recently reported, thiametoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid residues were determined in experimentally poisoned honey bees. Results: Oral and indirect contact trials were carried out for each pesticide, using commercial formulations. Honey bees that died during the trials were stored at -18 degrees C and analyzed through a LC-MS/MS analytical procedure adapted from AOAC methods. The quantity of insecticide residues that were detected resulted much lower than the administered residues. Honey bees that did not die within six hours from the trial start were also analyzed and the quantities of insecticide residues resulted much lower than those found in the dead honey bees.

Beauveria is typically deployed in one or more inundative applications of large numbers of aerial conidia in dry or liquid formulations, in a chemical paradigm. Mass production is mainly practiced by solid-state fermentation to yield hydrophobic aerial conidia, which remain the principal active ingredient of mycoinsecticides. More robust and cost-effective fermentation and formulation downstream platforms are imperative for its overall commercialization by industry. Hence, where economics allow, submerged liquid fermentation provides alternative method to produce effective and stable propagules that can be easily formulated as dry stable preparations. Formulation also continues to be a bottleneck in the development of stable and effective commercial Beauveria-mycoinsecticides in many countries, although good commercial formulations do exist. Future research on improving fermentation and formulation technologies coupled with the selection of multi-stress tolerant and virulent strains is needed to catalyze the widespread acceptance and usefulness of this fungus as a cost-effective mycoinsecticide. The role of Beauveria as one tool among many in integrated pest management, rather than a stand-alone management approach, needs to be better developed across the range of crop systems. Here, we provide an overview of mass-production and formulation strategies, updated list of registered commercial products, major biocontrol programs and ecological aspects affecting the use of Beauveria as a mycoinsecticide.",2016,32,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-016-2131-3

We discovered that T+S significantly stunted the overall growth in wildtype nematodes, an effect that was exacerbated by concurrent exposure to heat stress. T+S also negatively impacted fecundity as measured by increased germline apoptosis, a decrease in egg-laying, and fewer viable offspring. Lastly, exposure to T+S resulted in degenerative changes in nicotinic cholinergic neurons in wildtype nematodes.

Based on the UK-POEM model, the predictive exposure levels obtained varied from 0.0105 mg/kg body weight/day to 1.7855 mg/kg body weight/day, which is several times higher than the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level. However, the study also shows that exposure can be greatly reduced if the required Personal Protective Equipment is worn.

RESULTS: The maximum active ingredient content in the slow-release formulations was 2469 kg(-1). Infrared spectroscopy results revealed that the hydrophobic interactions between metribuzin and the alkyl chains on PC were necessary for encapsulation. In addition, water bridges connecting the herbicide and the PC headgroup enhanced the solubility of metribuzin in PC. Adsorption experiments in soils were performed to evaluate the relationship between sorption and leaching. Funnel experiments in a sandy soil revealed that the herbicide was not irreversibly retained in the formulation matrix. In soil column experiments, PC-clay formulations enhanced herbicide accumulation and biological activity in the top soil layer relative to a commercial formulation. PC-clay formulations also reduced the dissipation of metribuzin by a factor of 1.6-2.5. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the recommended dose of metribuzin can be achieved by employing PC-clay formulations, which reduces the environmental risk associated with herbicide applications. Moreover, PC and montmorillonite are non-toxic and do not negatively affect the environment. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry",2011,67,271,278,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2060

In the present study, sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction and cell cycle kinetics alterations by 2,4-D in 4-day old chick embryos were evaluated. Both a commercial herbicide formulation containing 37% 2,4-D isooctyl ester as active ingredient and pure 2,4-D were tested. Chick embryos were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg 2,4-D. Test solutions were applied to the inner shell membrane on day 0 of incubation. Either commercial formulation or pure 2,4-D induced a dose-related increase in SCE frequency over the concentration range from 0 to 4 mg/embryo. Significantly higher SCE frequency was seen for the 4-mg group of embryos treated with the commercial product. A slightly higher SCE value was observed for the vehicle group (acetone-treated embryos) compared with the negative controls (untreated embryos). Significant inhibition of cell cycle progression was evident in both experimental groups and was generally dose related. The extent of changes in cell kinetics was similar in both groups, although somewhat more marked in the group treated with pure 2,4-D.

Experiments were designed to separate the responses between sexes. In the study, paraquat was added as a commercial formulation Osaquat(R) containing 27.6% of active ingredient. The 96-h LC50 values for males and females were 67.40- and 52.48-mg of paraquat per liter, respectively. This significant, but close difference between sexes changes when we compare acute toxicity data between adults and fry of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus. The 96-h LC50 for the latter is 9.41-mg of paraquat per liter and the adult/fry ratio approaches 1 order of magnitude. Sublethal concentrations of paraquat (the higher of these was 20 mg/L) did not produce inhibition of the total cholinesterase activity for males and females compared to the controls at 96 h of exposure. On the other hand, we found a significant difference between sexes (p less than or equal to 0.05): about 50% for the enzymatic activity measured.

Pregnant animals were exposed to increasing doses of the herbicide (0.01, 0.1 and 100 mg/kg/d) during gestation days 0-9, after which animals were euthanized and their blood analyzed for catalase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Number of corpora lutea and uterine implantations and resorptions were also determined. Herbicide exposure did not cause any overt signs of maternal toxicity at any of the doses administered; neither did it cause an effect on developmental parameters. Catalase activity and TBARs were not modified by herbicide exposure although TAC was significantly decreased at 100 mg/kg/d of both pure and formulated compound. Thus, 2,4-D does not seem to induce oxidative stress during early pregnancy in mice at the doses administered, indicating that this mechanism is probably not involved in mediating herbicide toxicity at these dose levels. Furthermore, since no manifestations of developmental toxicity were observed after administration of the herbicide, it is also possible that 2,4-D may not produce any early developmental toxicity at the low environmentally relevant doses tested in this animal model.

Matrices such as beeswax and beebread were very little analysed despite their capacities for long-term pesticide storage. Moreover, bioavailability and transfer between in-hive matrices were poorly understood and explored. Many pesticides were studied but interactions between molecules or with other stressors were lacking. Sampling methods, targeted matrices and units of measure should have been, to some extent, standardised between publications to ease comparison and cross checking. Data on honey bee exposure to pesticides would have also benefit from the use of commercial formulations in experiments instead of active ingredients, with a special assessment of co-formulants (quantitative exposure and effects).

While the active ingredient is generally considered non-toxic, the toxicity resulting from exposure to commercially-sold formulations is less clear. In many cases, cell cultures or various model organisms exposed to glyphosate formulations show toxicity and, in some cases, lethality. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we assessed potential toxic mechanisms through which a highly-concentrated commercial formulation of TD promotes neurodegeneration. Following a 30-min treatment, we assayed mitochondrial electron transport chain function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Initial oxygen consumption studies indicated general mitochondrial inhibition compared to controls ((star)p < 0.05). When Complex II activity was further assessed, inhibition was observed in all TD-treated groups ((star)p < 0.05). Complex IV activity, however, was not adversely affected by TD. This electron transport chain inhibition also resulted in reduced ATP levels ((star)p < 0.05). Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide levels, but not other ROS, were increased ((star)p < 0.05). Taken together, these data indicate that commercially-available formulations of TD may exert neurotoxicity through Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) inhibition, decreased ATP levels, and increased hydrogen peroxide production.",2019,66,36,42,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2018.12.019

Development of toxic baits focusing on this carbohydrate-seeking behavior may potentially contribute to localized control. In the present study, ten insecticides were fed to female Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, and Aedes taeniorhynchus in a 10% sucrose solution. Active ingredients representative of five classes of insecticides (pyrethroids, phenylpyroles, pyrroles, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones) were selected for comparison with commercial formulations used to facilitate incorporation of active ingredients into aqueous sucrose solutions. Sucrose as a phagostimulant significantly enhanced mortality to toxicants. In general, the most effective active ingredients were fipronil, deltamethrin and imidacloprid, followed by spinosad, thiamethoxam, bifenthrin, permethrin, and cyfluthrin. The least effective ingredients were chlorfenapyr and ivermectin. For some of the ingredients tested, Cx. quinquefasciatus was the least susceptible species. One-day-old male Cx. quinquefasciatus were more susceptible than females; however, no differences existed between one-and seven-day-old mosquitoes. There were no differences in susceptibility between unfed and gravid ten-day-old female Cx. quinquefasciatus to bifenthrin.

RESULTS: All the WG formulations tested were effective in decreasing the apparent diffusivity of ethofumesate in soil in comparison with the non-formulated active substance. The slow-release effect was significantly more pronounced in the presence of the organically modified MMT, confirming the importance of sorption mechanisms to reduce ethofumesate diffusion. The bioassays undertaken on watercress to evaluate herbicidal antigerminating performances showed that all the WG formulations (with or without MMT) were more effective than both the commercial formulation and the non-formulated ethofumesate, whatever the concentration tested. To explain such results, it was proposed that WG formulations would enable ethofumesate to be more available and thus more effective in inhibiting seed germination, as they would be less prone to be leached by water transport due to watering and also less subject to photodegradation. CONCLUSION: The use of pesticide formulations based on wheat gluten and nanoclays appeared to be a promising strategy both to reduce the mobility of pesticides in soil and to protect UV-photosensitive pesticides from photodegradation.

Cube resins from Lonchocarpus contain large quantities of deguelin (ca. 21.2%) and smaller quantities of tephrosin (ca. 3.5%) and beta-rotenolone (ca. 3.0%). The composition of commercial formulations may present very different rotenoid contents depending on the extracts used to prepare them. Because these rotenoids also present insecticide activity, the efficacy of these formulations may be very different. The storage stability and photodegradation of some rotenone formulations were studied. Rotenone and rotenoids are very sensitive to solar radiation, which degrades them rapidly, with half-lives in the order of a few tens of minutes. Some formulations show greater disappearance rates than that of cube resin, indicating that not much attention has been paid to protecting the active ingredients from photodegradation in the formulation. A study on the residues on olives was also carried out to assess not only the rotenone content, but also that of the main rotenoids.

However, the weight gain and the protein content of abdominal muscle decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the highest atrazine concentration as compared to control, indicating that atrazine acted as a relevant stressor, although at a concentration higher than those reported in the environment. Besides, the proportion of females increased progressively as the atrazine concentration increases, being significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of controls at the highest concentration assayed. Both macroscopic and histological analysis revealed a normal architecture of gonopores and gonads in both control and exposed animals.

At I mg/L, the pesticides reduced survival in 5% of the 20 species-pesticide comparisons and reduced growth in 35% of the comparisons. At 2 mg/L, the pesticides had more widespread effects, reducing survival in 35% of the 20 species-pesticide comparisons and reducing growth in 70% of comparisons. Combined pesticides occasionally caused lower survival and growth than either pesticide alone, but the effects were never larger than the more deadly of the two pesticides alone at 2 mg/L.

The insecticide caused mortality at the higher concentrations employed, in which no change was observed in neurotransmission in the survivors. In contrast, at field concentrations, deltamethrin did not cause any deaths, but triggered significant changes in synapsin levels.

Reliable indicators still need to be found in order to properly assess the impact of pesticides in fish. After an in vivo chronic exposure to pendimethalin, the detoxification process and the antioxidant defense system were assessed in 120 adult rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: control (C), 500 ng L-1 (P500), 800 ng L-1 (P800) and the commercial formulation Prowl at 500 ng L-1 (Pw500). Fish samples were made after a 28 day exposure period (D28) and after a fifteen day recovery period in clean fresh water (D43). At D28, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was not activated in liver in spite of the pendimethalin uptake in fish. At D43, EROD activity in fish exposed to the commercial product was lower than in control fish, which may be explained by the high presence of herbicide in fish (613 +/- 163 ng g bile(-1)). Furthermore, antioxidant defense responses were set up by trout in gills and liver following chronic exposure to 800 ng L-1 of pendimethalin concentration. While the glutathione content (GSH) decreased in gills, it increased in liver associated with higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These disturbances could lead to reactive oxygen species production and oxidative stress in the vital organs in fish. After fifteen days in clean water, while the SOD activity was restored, the GSH content and GPx activity were still significantly disturbed in fish exposed to pendimethalin in comparison with control. These significant differences between treatments in antioxidant defenses parameters measured, attesting to the irreversibility of the effects. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In some cases, differences were also observed between the commercial formulation and the pure active ingredient (factors of up to 1.4 for sorption and 1.7 for degradation). In the regulatory context, the common assumption that formulations do not influence the environmental fate of pesticide active ingredients after application seems therefore not always adequate.

Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780 nor the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 was able to block the QpE-induced lipid accumulation. RNAseq analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to QpE suggests that this compound exerts its lipid accumulation effects via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)-mediated pathway, a nuclear receptor whose modulation influences lipid metabolism. QpE was further shown to be active in a PPAR gamma reporter gene assay at 100 mu M, reaching 4% of the maximal response produced by rosiglitazone, which acts as a positive control. This indicates that lipid accumulation induced by QpE is only in part caused by PPAR gamma activation.

Besides actions relative to the way the substances are introduced into the environment, it is also possible to limit the contamination by interfering on their transfer pathways from fields to the main river network. Especially, interface areas such as buffer strips or small ditches may play a major part in pesticide diffuse pollution decrease. In ditches a great variety of materials may act as sorbents for organic contaminants: grass, leaves, wood debris or sediments. In this study, laboratory experiments were designed to determine sorption characteristics for three herbicides with different physicochemical properties on sediment and leaves in decay commonly found in agricultural ditches. Sorption capacities were assessed for the herbicides isoproturon, diuron and diflufenican. Experimental design was carried out to investigate the effects of five parameters on herbicide sorption on sediment and dead leaves. These parameters have been chosen according to parallel field experiment needs. Thus, the influence of initial sorbent moisture, herbicide form, i.e. active substance or commercial formulation, water quality (tap or natural ditch water), bromide ions (used as conservative tracers) and solid/liquid ratio have been tested. Within the parameters investigated, pesticide formulation and solid/liquid ratio were the most important parameters affecting pesticide sorption on both ditch materials. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Commercial insecticide formulations, however, contain a significant proportion (>90%) of so-called inert ingredients, which may alter the toxicity of the active ingredient(s). This study compares the sublethal toxicity of two insecticides, the pyrethroid bifenthrin, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil, to their commercial formulations, Talstar (R) and Termidor (R). Both insecticides are used for landscape treatment and structural pest control, and can be transported into surface water bodies via stormwater and irrigation runoff. We used larval fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), to determine effects on growth and swimming performance after short-term (24 h) exposure to sublethal concentrations of pure insecticides and the respective formulations. Significantly enhanced 7 d growth was observed at 10% of the 24 h LC10 (53 mu g L-1) fipronil. Swimming performance was significantly impaired at 20% of the 24 h LC10 (0.14 mu g L-1) of bifenthrin and 10% of the 24 h LC10 of Talstare (0.03 mu g L-1). Fipronil and Termidor led to a significant impairment of swimming performance at 142 mu g L-1 and 148 mu g L-1 respectively, with more pronounced effects for the formulation. Our data shows that based on dissolved concentrations both formulations were more toxic than the pure active ingredients, suggesting that increased toxicity due to inert ingredients should be considered in risk assessments and regulation of insecticides.

Pure mesotrione (active ingredient), and Callisto (a commercial formulation of this triketone herbicide), were spread at different rates on soil microcosm surfaces. Soil Chlorophyll concentrations were quantified to assess the photosynthetic biomass, and the genetic structure and diversity of the cyanobacterial community were investigated by a group-specific polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Dose-dependent responses were evidenced for both functional and structural parameters. No effect was detected in soils treated with 1 x AR (1-fold recommended application rate) irrespective of the herbicide formulation. At 10 x AR (10-fold recommended application rate), only Callisto treatment induced significant decreases of photosynthetic biomass, whereas structural parameters were less affected. At the 100 x AR (100-fold recommended application rate), both pure mesotrione and Callisto had strong negative impacts on soil chlorophyll concentrations and cyanobacterial genetic structure and diversity. At both the 10 x AR and 100 x AR treatments, Callisto induced significant stronger effects than pure mesotrione.

In aquatic ecosystems, periphy tic biofilms, or periphyton, are at the base of food webs and are often the first communities to be in direct contact with runoff. Microcosm experiments were conducted to assess the effects of a pulse exposure of glyphosate on community composition and chlorophyll a concentrations of lake biofilms at different colonization stages (2 months, 1 year, and 20 years). This is the first study that uses such contrasting submersion periods. Biofilms were exposed to either environmental levels of pure analytical grade glyphosate (6 mu g/L, 65 mu g/L, and 600 mu g/L) or to corresponding phosphorus concentrations. Community composition was determined by deep sequencing of the 18S and 16S rRNA genes to target eukaryotes and cyanobacteria, respectively. The results showed that submersion period was the only significant contributor to community structure. However, at the taxon level, the potentially toxic genus Anabaena was found to increase in relative abundance. We also observed that glyphosate releases phosphorus into the surrounding water, but not in a bio-available form. The results of this study indicate that environmental concentrations of glyphosate do not seem to impact the community composition or metabolism of lake biofilms under pulse event conditions.

The laboratory test was conducted according to the OECD guidelines. Mortality, biomass, and growth inhibition were chosen as toxic endpoints. No death was recorded at the lowest concentration (1/4 RAD) of the insecticide or the limacide after 7- and 14-day exposures, nor was it recorded at the highest concentration (4x RAD) of the insecticide or the limacide after 7-day exposure. Triazine herbicide Terbis was found the most toxic and ecologically dangerous to E. fetida, because it LC50 value (1.26 mg kg(-1)) was very close to the respective RAD and the growth inhibition in all concentrations was significantly positive. Although E. fetida was found susceptible to the organophosphorus insecticide Galition, due to the significant positive growth inhibition at the highest concentration, the value of LC50 was higher than its RAD.

Data fusion strategy combined with partial least squares (PLS) regression was applied. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling was engaged to investigate effective variables in the PLS regression. Compared with the models established by independent NIR or MIR, there was a significant improvement provided by data fusion strategy, which benefited from the synergistic effect of complementary information obtained from NIR and MIR spectra.

Microfluidic is a controllable nanoemulsion preparation system which mainly applied to pharmaceutical synthesis. In this study, the pesticide phoxim nanoemulsion was prepared by microfluidic technology.

For all Als, more effective photodegradation was achieved by UVA than by visible light irradiation. The most efficient degradation was observed in the case of thiacloprid, which degraded completely after two hours of irradiation using UVA, and 59% using visible light irradiation. On the other hand, the most stable appeared to be acetamiprid, whereby during the same time of irradiation it was degraded 42% using UVA, and only 4% using visible light irradiation. Because of that the efficiency of a number of advanced oxidation processes was examined in the case of acetamiprid. It was found that the presence of H2O2 in ZnO, 7.8Fe/ZnO, and 7.2Fe/TiO2 systems using UVA did not bring significant changes in the efficiency of degradation. However, using visible light irradiation the presence of H2O2 in ZnO and 7.8Fe/ZnO systems significantly increases efficiency of acetamiprid degradation. Also, by adjusting pH to 2.80 in the system 7.2Fe/TiO2/H2O2 using both type of irradiation resulted in a significant increase of the degradation efficiency. For the first time, for ZnO/H2O2 system a general reaction mechanism in the dark, as well as in the presence of visible light irradiation was proposed.

Fipronil is a potent insecticide that eliminates pests, including insects resistant to pyrethroids, organophosphates (OP) and carbamates (CA). There is little known on the toxic effects of fipronil on non-target organisms, such as tadpoles of frogs. It is possible that this compound carries a high toxicity for these organisms, since the pesticide can be incorporated into aquatic environments during the rainy season, a time which coincides with the time of amphibian reproduction and the occurrence of tadpoles in the aquatic environment in this region. Thus, the pesticide could be contributing to the decline of amphibians in the northwest region of Sao Paulo state due to its wide use. This study aimed to test the influence of Regent (R) 800WG on some biochemical systems of tadpoles (such as antioxidant defense systems) at different stages of development. The results of analysis from in vivo exposures demonstrated that only a few parameters in the groups exposed to fipronil responded to exposure to Regent (R) 800WG, results which indicate that the pesticide instigates biochemical responses in tadpoles. Although catalase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were unchanged during the experiments, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was inhibited in tadpoles, and the activity of glutathione reductase (GR) varied according to the exposure period and pesticide concentration. This data demonstrated the influence of the fipronil formulation on the metabolism of tadpoles, and showed that it can increase their susceptibility to environmental contaminants.

For this study, we assessed how sucrose-water (10% w/v) feeding status impacted the response of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to select insecticides. RESULTS Starvation for 24 or 48 h decreased permethrin and malathion mean survival time by about 40%, with little difference in the two starvation times. Similar findings were also observed in a pyrethroid-resistant Puerto Rico strain challenged with permethrin, but these effects were less pronounced. To test the impact of mosquito weight, we measured weight under different 48-h nutritional conditions and found that sugar-water-fed and sugar-only-fed individuals were approximately the same weight (ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test P value >0.999) and that individuals fed water only were considerably lighter than either sugar-water-fed (ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test P value = 0.034) or sugar-only-fed individuals (ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test P value = 0.027) but equal in weight to starved mosquitoes (ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test P value >0.99). Of the nutritional challenges, water-only-fed mosquitoes were the most insecticide tolerant (ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test P values to all other treatments <0.01). CONCLUSIONS The results indicate insect nutritional status is an important experimental variable, particularly the hydration status of mosquitoes shortly before insecticide exposure. Moreover, as significant differences were observed between starved and component-fed (water, sugar, or sugar and water) mosquitoes in a pyrethroid-resistant strain, some caution is appropriate when interpreting resistance/susceptibility diagnoses with this bioassay.",2022,78,743,748,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6687

This study aimed to assess the effects of four common pesticides on the microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata: DIAZINON (R) 25% C. E., Roundup (R), URBACIN (R) 20C. E., and VAPODEL (R) 20% C. E., which are commercial formulations of diazinon, glyphosate, dichlorvos, and cypermethrin, respectively. According to 96-h inhibition of population growth bioassays, the four pesticide toxicities exemplified the following order: DIAZINON (R) (diazinon) > Roundup (R) (glyphosate) > VAPODEL (R) (dichlorvos) > URBACIN (R) (cypermethrin). Increasing pesticide concentrations elicited alterations in the specific growth rates (mu max). The macromolecule contents and photosynthetic pigments increased in groups exposed to the highest concentrations of DIAZINON (R) 25%, Roundup (R), and URBACIN (R) 20 compared to the control group, despite these treatments inducing lower population growth rates. VAPODEL (R) 20% induced higher growth rates and lower macromolecule content compared to the control. Since active ingredients were not quantified, certain comparisons may prove limiting, but it is important to assess the effects of the whole mixtures in the form that they enter the environment, especially for urban-intended applications or generic formulations with higher additive contents. Finally, this study demonstrated that commercial pesticide formulations designed for urban applications might pose a threat to freshwater microalgae due to their underestimated toxic potential, but further studies are required.",2022,31,1462,1476,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-022-02596-6

After 4 days of exposure to commercial 2,4-D, a small (P < 0.05) dose-related increase of SCE was seen for the 4-mg group. An enhanced SCE response upon long-term exposure to 2,4-D was apparent. After 10 days of exposure, SCE frequencies for the 2- and 4-mg commercial 2,4-D, and 4-mg pure 2,4-D groups were significantly higher than for the controls. A significant slowing of cell cycle at concentrations at and above 1 mg was seen. Also observed was a slight, not statistically significant proliferative effect at the lowest dose of 0.5 mg/embryo.

Glyphosate inhibited M. phaseolina growth in a linear dose dependent manner when technical grade glyphosate acid (GlyCry) was used; however, growth was inhibited in an exponential dose dependent manner when a commercial formulation of glyphosate-potassium salt (Gly-K salt) was used. The glyphosate GR(50) values (glyphosate concentration required to cause a 50% reduction) in culture radial growth ranged from 0.25 to 9.94 mM among the M. Phaseolina isolates, temperatures, and formulations. The three isolates differed in response to various concentrations across the three temperature regimes. Among the three isolates, TN 410 was the most sensitive for both GlyCry (GR(50) = 7.74 mM) and Gly-K salt (GR(50) = 0.25 mM) at 30 degrees C. This research indicates that glyphosate has the ability to inhibit growth of M. phaseolina in culture in vitro.

Their populations have a tendency of rapidly developing resistance to acaricides, making it necessary to have a variety of active ingredients for sustainable chemical control of this pest. We investigated acaricidal properties of a relatively new insecticide spirotetramat using its commercial formulation, Movento Energy. Spirotetramat applied at concentrations equivalent to the field rates of 78 and 90 g ai/ha had a strong negative effect on the survival of the treated T. urticae, with ca. 95% of females and ca. 65% of males dying after the treatment. Spirotetramat appeared to interfere with female reproductive system. Many of the dead treated females had eggs stuck in the oviduct and protruding from their bodies. Surviving treated females did not lay eggs. Furthermore, untreated females that mated with treated males did not produce female offspring and displayed the symptoms of spirotetramat poisoning. Toxic effects continued manifesting themselves after female mites were transferred from treated onto untreated plant culture. Contrary to previous studies, contact toxicity was also detected. None of the treated immature stages survived to adulthood. Based on these results, spirotetramat may be a good option for integrated pest management in crops that are simultaneously affected by sucking insects and spider mites and in pesticide rotation sequences that are a part of integrated resistance management programs.",2019,112,2186,2192,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz160

This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of pure glyphosate or Roundup on pregnant mice and their fetuses during pregnancy. From gestation days (GDs) 1-19, ICR mice were orally administered distilled water, 0.5% glyphosate solution or 0.5%-glyphosate Roundup (R) solution. The ovaries and serum were collected at GD19. The results showed decreases in body weight gain and, ovary and liver weight in glyphosate-treated mice. Additionally, histopathological alterations in the ovary including increased atretic follicles, interstitial fibrosis and decreased mature follicles were observed in the groups treated with glyphosate. The serum concentrations of both progesterone and estrogen were markedly altered after glyphosate exposure, and there were also changes in the expression of GnRH, LHR, FSHR, 3 beta-HSD and Cyp19a1 genes at the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Furthermore, oxidative stress was observed in the treated mice, increasing the activity of T-AOC, CAT and GSH-Px, as well as the MDA content in both the serum and ovary. With regard to litters, the sex ratio was significantly altered by pure glyphosate. These results show that glyphosate is able to cause several effects on pregnant mice, such as ovarian failure, interference with hormone secretion by affecting the steroidogenesis-related gene expression, and oxidative stress. The sex ratio of litters was also influenced by prenatal exposure to pure glyphosate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018,243,833,841,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.049

When sprayed in a laboratory chamber, the mix caused phase separation in the atomizer. Addition of surfactants at 2 to 3% level minimized the problem, although phase separation still occurred in droplets while they were in-flight. Droplets collected on samplers showed three types of spots: (i) those containing particles in the centre surrounded by a liquid ring (PR), (ii) those containing particles only (P), and (iii) those containing liquid matrix only (L). The number of 'PR' spots decreased while the droplets were in-flight, resulting in an increase in the `P' and `L' spots at the target level. Persistence of tebufenozide in spruce foliage was unaffected by phase separation in droplets, but bioactivity was affected. When the deposits contained mostly 'PR' spots, mortality in spruce budworm fed with treated foliage was high, whereas when the deposits contained mostly 'P' and `L' spots, mortality was low. The results suggest that when the insect consumed a `P' spot alone (mostly tebufenozide particles) without the liquid phase, the antifeedant activity of the toxicant was more pronounced than when the insect consumed a `PR' spot containing both particulate and liquid phases together. Thus, phase separation in droplets caused a decrease in foliar consumption, resulting in low intake of the toxicant and reduced bioactivity.",1997,32,235,260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601239709373084

Although broad-spectrum insecticides are often used to protect olive crops against B. oleae, there is increasing concern about their effects on the environment and human health. An important tool in integrated olive fly management could be the use of products with a repellency and oviposition deterrence effect. This research yielded experimental evidence of significant oviposition deterrent activity on the olive fly as side effects of substances used in olive growing such as fungicides or plant biostimulants, highlighting the potential use of these products in B. oleae management. The control of Bactrocera oleae is fundamental to decreasing the significant production loss in olive cultivation. However, traditional containment based on the use of synthetic insecticides has been encountering serious limitations due to their negative effect on human health and the environment. Within the scope of integrated olive fly management, the use of products with repellency and oviposition deterrent activity might represent a more eco-friendly solution. In this study, we tested the oviposition deterrent activity of some commercial formulations already used in olive tree crops as fungicides (copper oxychloride, dodine, mancozeb, pyraclostrobin and difeconazole) and plant bio-stimulants (tannins, clay, flavonoids and a zinc-copper-citric acid biocomplex). The trials were conducted testing the oviposition behavior of mated olive fly females in both choice and no-choice assays. Our results showed that most of the substances have affected the ovipositional activity of the olive fly, except for difeconazole. Moreover, some products (copper oxychloride, flavonoids and tannins) have proven to differently influence the flies' oviposition comparing the two tests. The repellent effect of these commercial products should be further studied to prove whether the repellency was due either to the active ingredient or to the co-formulants, and to assess their effect in the open field.",2022,13,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13040363

It is present in particle form in the environment; however, no study exploring its potential health impact on airways and the respiratory system has been published. Here, the biological effect of these particles was investigated in vitro on human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-). To be close to the real-life conditions exposure, Folpan 80WGO (R), a commercial form of folpet, was tested. Folpan 80WGO particles showed dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effects on 16HBE14o- cells. This effect was compared to that produced by technical-grade folpet and both were found to induce a toxicity with similar IC50 values after 24h of exposure. After 4h and at least until 48h of exposure, the IC50 values of Folpan 80WG (R) particles were between 2.4 and 2.8 mu g/cm(2). Investigation of the cytotoxicity found that Folpan 80WGO particles at 1.85 mu g/cm(2) induced an increase in ROS production from the first hour of exposure. Evidence that oxidative processes occur in folpet-exposed cells was confirmed by the presence of membrane lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, early apoptosis and late apoptosis/necrosis were both present after the first hour of exposure. These findings indicate that exposure to Folpan 80WG (R) particles result in a rapid cytotoxic effect on human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro that could be in part explained by oxidative stress, characterised by membrane lipid peroxiclation and ROS production.

Pesticides may easily reach and contaminate surface waterbodies mainly through drainage 7 and spray drift, and hence are currently viewed as a major contamination issue. Following recent discussion on the ability of adjuvant chemicals added to marketed formulations to contribute for pesticide toxicity, this study focuses the acute and chronic toxicity of the insecticide Lannate (R) and the herbicide Stam Novel Flo (R), as well as that of their active ingredients Methomyl and Propanil, to the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna. Furthermore, acute and chronic toxicity of mixtures is addressed, through the evaluation of D. magna responses to joint exposures comprising both active ingredients and both commercial formulations. Regarding acute exposures, the mixture comprising commercial solutions was shown to have a more than additive action, while the opposite (less than additive action) was found when testing the joint action of the active ingredients. Chronic exposures can provide additional information on chemicals' toxicity in reproductive endpoints, which is of particular relevance when considering that pesticides are often repeatedly applied within a single agricultural season. Life-history endpoints assessed under mixture exposures indeed indicated higher Iona-term. 17 C, than short-term toxicity, and showed a distinct pattern of joint action when compared to acute toxicity assessments.

Initial studies have shown that MON 0818 is more toxic to aquatic animals than the active ingredient. However, few studies have examined the effect of exposure to MON 0818 on species of mollusks, and no studies have examined the effect on gastropods. The present study investigated the effect of acute exposure (96h) of MON 0818 to the eggs, juveniles, and adults of the file ramshorn snail (Planorbella pilsbryi). Concentrations of MON 0818 up to 9.9mg/L did not have a significant effect on the viability of eggs (p>0.05). Juvenile snails (50% lethal concentration [LC50]=4.0mg/L) were more sensitive than adult snails (LC50=4.9-9.1mg/L). Oviposition was inhibited by exposure to MON 0818 (median effective concentration [EC50]=0.4-2.0mg/L). However, oviposition resumed when snails were removed to clean water, even after 96-h exposure to up to 4.9mg/L of MON 0818. Exposure to a concentration 2.7mg/L caused visible damage to the tentacles of adult snails, which could potentially impact chemoreception. A deterministic hazard assessment indicated that environmentally relevant concentrations of MON 0818 could pose a hazard to the deposition of eggs. However, because of the relatively short half-life of MON 0818 in aquatic systems and the ability of snails to resume oviposition following the dissipation of MON 0818, environmentally relevant concentrations of MON 0818 likely pose a de minimis risk to populations of ramshorn snails.

Of the various weed management techniques (including physical, mechanical, cultural, biological and chemical), chemical control measures are prioritized and the first choice of crop growers, and are increasing because of rapid effects and ease of application. Although utilization of herbicides has become a dominant tool, available commercial formulations have the disadvantage that active ingredients that do not reach the target immediately after application (more than 90%) are lost by various mechanisms. These unused herbicides cause contamination of the surrounding environment through water movement and have diverse toxicological effects on plants, animals, and the environment. However, preparation of nanocomposite-supported controlled release formulations (CRFs) of herbicide is a major innovation that can prolong the duration of herbicide efficiency through stabilizing structure, inhibiting immediate release and reducing toxicity. Of the various nanomaterials, layered aluminosilicate is a suitable carrier for CRFs because of its eco-friendly nature. In this context, pristine clays could be modified through various processes. For example, cation exchange using organo-surfactants is a prerequisite for CRFs and converts clay particles from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, thereby facilitating entry of the herbicide into the gallery. In addition, it is important to use less toxic or non-toxic surfactants for clay modification to reduce the toxicological effects on the environment. This review addresses future research areas such as investigation/synthesis of bio-surfactants and their compatibility in clay modifications for CRFs of herbicides.",2022,175,301,345,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.agron.2022.04.003

However, the effects of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms have scarcely been studied, and relevant experiments are usually conducted under laboratory conditions using active ingredient. Therefore, the effects of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms when applied to actual farmland are unknown. We sought to address this knowledge gap in this study, where we studied the effects of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms in a wheat-corn rotation field over two years. The results indicate that after two years of azoxystrobin application the activities of soil enzymes were inhibited, and the abundance of functional genes related to the nitrogen and carbon cycle were inhibited, which change the abundance of soil microbial bacteria of genera. As a consequence, the soil nitrogen and carbon cycles were disturbed. In addition, azoxystrobin inhibited the abundance of func-tional bacteria related to organic pollutant degradation and soil metabolism, where the rate of azoxystrobin degradation diminished over time. Moreover, azoxystrobin significantly inhibited the soil-culturable microbial population. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) indicated that the soil-culturable microbial population can be used as a sensitive indicator of the effect of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms. The final levels of azoxystrobin residues measured in grains were less than 0.004 mg/kg, lower than the maximum residue limits in European Union and China.

Initially, the 96-h LC50 values of AzM and GUS were estimated for two different life stages of Xenopus laevis, embryos, and tadpoles. The actual AzM concentrations in exposure media were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography. Also, the sub-lethal effects of these compounds to tadpoles were determined 24 h later at exposure concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/L using selected biomarker enzymes such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotrasferase. Differences in AChE inhibition capacities of AzM and GUS were evaluated under in vitro conditions between frogs and fish in the second part of this study.

According to in vivo studies AChE, CaE and GST are important biomarkers of the effect of OP exposure while CaE may be more effective in short-term, low-concentration exposures. The results of in vitro studies showed that amphibian brain AChEs were relatively more resistant to OP exposure than fish AChEs.

In vivo assays included applications of fungicide on full bloom panicles of a male-sterile line, ATx623, and then inoculating particles with a conidial suspension immediately after the fungicide had dried. In greenhouse trials and in the 2000 field evaluation, a single application of propiconazole, tebuconazole, triadimefon, myclobutanil, or azoxystrobin at a rate of 25 mug ml(-1) markedly suppressed ergot severity on ATx623.

Presenting adverse effects of glyphosate and its formulations we focused on the role of glyphosate formulations in hormonal disorders by impeding the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and the inhibition of aromatase activity. The impact of glyphosate on oxygen reactive species formation, changes in redox system and the effect on necrosis and apoptosis in various types of cells was shown. We also revealed that glyphosate as a phosphonate herbicide does not inhibit directly the activity of acetylcholinesterase. Based on numerous studies it was noted that commercial formulations of glyphosate exhibit higher toxicity than that of the active substance itself. The discussed problems clearly show the need to evaluate the toxicity of glyphosate and its formulations and related potential threat to humans.",2013,64,717,729,NA

This policy is thought to partially explain the conflicting outcomes of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and EPA assessments on glyphosate, and there is substantial scientific evidence that this approach has led to an underestimation of risk. In this paper, we present a review of EPA pesticide policy governing the regulation of active and other ingredients and findings from a survey of US agricultural scientists focused on their views of this EPA policy. The survey findings indicate that the scientists we surveyed support a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of pesticide products, including both active and inert ingredients, as well as the end use product, to test for combined effects. They also support the disclosure and labeling of inert ingredients to support independent testing of these chemicals. The results also indicate that university scientists oriented towards public science are more likely to support regulation than university scientists oriented towards private science. Overall, despite substantial evidence that the combination of all ingredients in pesticide products may be more toxic than the active ingredients alone, the current regulatory approach does not provide a pathway for the agency to respond to this science. In this sense, the scientific support for the agency's current regulatory approach is unclear.",2023,13,1,13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13412-022-00788-4

In an initial screening, an ethanolic extract from A. mucosa seeds (LC50 = 1479 ppm) and Anosom(A (R)) 1 EC (LC50 = 1151 ppm) were the most promising treatments. In addition to acute toxicity, pronounced inhibition of H. armigera larval growth was observed in both treatments. Using chromatographic techniques, bioguided fractionations were conducted and the acetogenin bis-tetrahydrofuran rolliniastatin-1 was isolated as the primary compound from the most active fractions of A. mucosa. At a concentration of 41.55 ppm, rolliniastatin-1 caused total mortality of H. armigera larvae after the fourth day of exposure. In greenhouse trials, extract of A. mucosa (as an emulsifiable concentrate formulation) and the botanical insecticide based on extract of Annona squamosa L.

Also, the bug vectors bacterial and fungal pathogens causing necrosis of the locule and rotting the bolls. Control options are mostly dependent upon and limited to the use of insecticides. Data are needed to assess the toxicity of currently available insecticides and develop baseline mortality data to monitor resistance of the insect to insecticides in Central Texas. We studied the toxicity of selected organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides in a glass-vial bioassay to adult southern green stink bugs captured in blacklight traps. Dicrotophos was six times more toxic than acephate to southern green stink bug. Toxicity of acephate and chlorpyrifos was comparable.

Mixtures of technical-grade active ingredients were 4- to 7.5-fold more toxic to southern green stink bug compared to commercially-formulated insecticides.

Numerous studies have reported detrimental effects of agrochemical sprays on pollination, fruit set, and yield in tree fruit crops. However, effects of fungicides on pollen germination and growth in almond are little known, particularly those from recently developed active ingredients. In this study we evaluated the effects of commercial formulations of 10 fungicides on pollen germination and tube growth in almond using in vitro assays. Assays conducted at 1/100 recommended field rates (RFR) were effective in delineating differences in almond pollen sensitivity to different fungicides. Captan and azoxystrobin were the most inhibitory, with germination percentages of less than 1 % of the no-fungicide control. Germination was not significantly affected by propiconazole and benomyl. Intermediate inhibitory effects on pollen germination were observed with ziram, cyprodinil, maneb, thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, and myclobutanil. In contrast to germination, tube growth was less affected by the presence of fungicide. In pollen that germinated, tube elongation was the same as in controls in five of 10 of the fungicides evaluated. Nonetheless, azoxystrobin and captan reduced tube elongation by approximate to90%. Some fungicide treatments also influenced tube morphology.

Assuming that glyphosate may increase the organic turbidity of water bodies, we evaluated the effect of a single application of 2.4 +/- 0.1 mg l(-1) of glyphosate (technical grade) on freshwater bacterioplankton and phytoplankton (pico, micro, and nanophytoplankton) and on the physical and chemical properties of the water. We used outdoor experimental mesocosms under clear and oligotrophic (phytoplanktonic chlorophyll a = 2.04 mu g l(-1); turbidity = 2.0 NTU) and organic turbid and eutrophic (phytoplanktonic chlorophyll a = 50.3 mu g l(-1); turbidity = 16.0 NTU) scenarios. Samplings were conducted at the beginning of the experiment and at 1, 8, 19, and 33 days after glyphosate addition.

Two-way mixtures of commercial formulations of propiconazole with either benomyl, captan, chlorothalonil, cyprodinil or vinclozolin were evaluated in vitro for potential synergism in inhibiting Monilinia fructicola, the causal agent of blossom blight and brown rot of stone fruits. Propiconazole was emphasized because of its widespread use and the recent detection of isolates of M. fructicola with reduced sensitivity to this fungicide. Experiments included each active ingredient at low, medium and high concentrations in all possible pairwise combinations. Inhibition of radial growth of two isolates of M. fructicola was not significantly different (P > 0.01) from that predicted by a simple model of independent action for any of the fungicide-concentration combinations, indicating absence of synergism between active ingredients. Results were similar when mixtures of propiconazole with either benomyl, chlorothalonil or cyprodinil were evaluated on peach fruit treated with fungicide. While fungicide mixtures are useful in delaying the development of fungicide resistance, they are unlikely to be used in practice unless synergistic interactions allow for applications at reduced concentrations.

Amphibians are subject to pesticide exposure for occurring in or around sugarcane fields, and for breeding at the onset of the rainy season when pesticide consumption is common. We tested the hypothesis that herbicides used in sugarcane crops, although employed for weed control and manipulated at doses recommended by the manufacturers, can cause lethal and sublethal effects on amphibian larvae. Boana pardalis was exposed to glyphosate, ametryn, 2,4-D, metribuzin and acetochlor which account to up to 2/3 of the volume of herbicides employed in sugarcane production. High mortality was observed following prolonged exposure to ametryn (76%), acetochlor (68%) and glyphosate (15%); ametryn in addition significantly reduced activity rates and slowed developmental and growth rates. AChE activity was surprisingly stimulated by glyphosate, ametryn and 2,4-D, and GST activity by ametryn and acetochlor. Some of these sublethal effects, including the decrease in activity, growth and developmental rates, may have important consequences for individual performance for extending the larval period, and hence the risk of dessication, in the temporary and semi-permanent ponds where the species develops.

Typhimurium was exposed to active ingredients dicamba, 2,4-D and glyphosate to determine what ingredients of the commercial formulations caused this effect. Co-formulants Tween80 and carboxymethyl cellulose induced changes in response, but the pattern of the responses differed from the active ingredients, and effect sizes were smaller. A commercial wetting agent did not affect antibiotic responses. Active ingredients induced changes in antibiotic responses similar to those caused by complete formulations. This occurred at or below recommended application concentrations. Targeted deletion of efflux pump genes largely neutralized the adaptive response in the cases of increased survival in antibiotics, indicating that the biochemistry of induced resistance was the same for formulations and specific ingredients. We found that glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D, as well as co-formulants in commercial herbicides, induced a change in susceptibility of the potentially pathogenic bacteria E. coli and S. enterica to multiple antibiotics.

A comprehensive understanding of their effective action at different levels of biological organization is critical for establishing guidelines to protect ecosystems and human health. Dinitroanilines are broad-spectrum pre-emergence herbicides currently used for weed control in the conventional agriculture. They are considered extremely safe agrochemicals because they act specifically on tubulin proteins and inhibit shoot and root growth of plants. However, there is a lack of toxicity information regarding the potential risk of exposure to non-target organisms. The aim of the present review is to focus on side effects of the most commonly used active ingredients, e.g. pendimethalin, oryzalin, trifluralin and benfluralin, on animal non-target cells of invertebrates and vertebrates. Acute toxicity varies from slightly to high in terrestrial and aquatic species (i.e. nematodes, earthworms, snails, insects, crustaceans, fish and mammals) depending on the species-specific ability of tested organisms to adsorb and discharge toxicants. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and activation of oxidative stress pathways as well as alterations of physiological, metabolic, morphological, developmental and behavioural traits, reviewed here, indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of active ingredients poses a clear hazard to animals and humans.

This herbicide exhibited a rapid degradation rate in simulated aquatic environment with half-lives ranged from 27.9 min to 4.6 h. The commercial formulation of clethodim showed a faster degradation with half-lives from 19.3 min to 1.4 h. It has also been demonstrated that the photolytic behavior of clethodim was affected by the water composition and the radiation intensity. Nine major photoproducts were identified and their distribution was dependent on the experimental conditions. Photodegraded solutions of clethodim were shown to be more toxic to the bacteria Vibrio fischeri than the herbicide itself, reaching the maximumtoxicity when the herbicide is completely degraded. QSAR analysis of the fate, ecotoxicological and physicochemical endpoints of the degradation products provided positive alerts for several identified by-products. Environmental fate and transport estimates showed that all photoproducts, unlike the active substance, are potential leachers. Moreover, predicted vapor pressures suggested that dermal contact and ingestion are the most probable exposure routes for workers and general population to both clethodim and its photoproducts. These results highlight the importance of the degradation products in attaining a complete knowledge of the fate and behavior of an herbicide in the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a detailed QSAR study on clethodim photoproducts under environmental conditions.

The active ingredient must be formulated with other ingredients to allow mixing, dilution, application, and stability. Liquid commercial formulations for spray foliar application include water-soluble liquids, emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates or flowables, and gels. Dry formulations that are mixed with water for spray application include wettable powders and water-dispersible granules. Granules are broadcast directly out of the bag. The carrier in liquid formulations is either water or an organic solvent or oil. The general chemical class of the carrier may be deduced based on the solubility characteristics of the active ingredient. Cosolvents may be necessary to optimize solubility and stability. Surfactants are nearly universally present in herbicide formulations or added prior to application. They aid uniform spreading of the spray droplet on the leaf and penetration of its waxy cuticle by the active ingredient. In solvent-based formulations, surfactants permit a stable oil-in-water emulsion to form when diluted with water for actual use. New surfactant systems are currently of intense competitive importance. Other formulation ingredients include pH adjusters, buffers, milling aids, antifoaming agents, acid scavengers, dyes, suspending agents, preservatives, dispersants, emulsifiers, densifiers, antifreeze, and crystal promoters. In highly regulated environments, the other formulation components in pesticides are receiving scrutiny. In the US, the EPA's strategy has been to categorize currently used formulation ingredients into 4 lists based on their toxicology profiles.

Ecotoxicity tests were carried out according to ISO protocols to assess the avoidance behaviour of earthworms (Eisenia andrei) and avoidance and reproduction of collembolans (Folsomia candida). In the earthworm's avoidance test, more than 80% of the individuals were found in the control, in all tested concentrations, indicating a possible habitat function loss in both soils. The avoidance behaviour of collembolans was observed in both soils, being more expressive (up to 75% of escape) in Oxisol. In Entisol, only the two highest concentrations were avoided (up to 63%). There was a negative effect on the reproduction of collembolans in both soils, with a higher EC50 value (0.255 mg kg(-1)) in Oxisol than in Entisol (0.177 mg kg(-1)), demonstrating higher toxicity in the sandy soil. These differences were attributed to the contrasting texture of the studied soils, probably due to lower retention of the a.i. in the sandy soil, causing an increased bioavailability.

This study compares the soil fate and bioaccumulation of four model nanopesticides (chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole loaded on polymeric and lipid nanocarriers) relative to the conventional formulations and pure active ingredients (all added at 0.5 mg kg(-1)) in microcosms containing earthworms Eisenia fetida and lettuce Lactuca sativa in two soils (LUFA 2.1 and 2.4) over a period of four months. The nanoformulations increased the soil half-life of the pesticides by up to 2 times (e.g. chlorpyrifos with lipid nanocarrier and tebuconazole with polymeric nanocarrier in LUFA 2.1), probably as a direct consequence of the slow release of the pesticide from the nanocarriers. Pesticide bioaccumulation in earthworms was often increased for the nanopesticides probably as a result of their enhanced bioavailability. The nanoformulations were also shown to affect the pesticide bioaccumulation in plants, but trends were inconsistent. Overall, the microcosm results demonstrated that nanoformulations can significantly alter the fate and bioavailability of pesticides.

Results showed that Amistar was more toxic than Prosaro, particularly for reproduction (EC50 = 161 mg Amistar/kg soil, EC50 = 350 mg Prosaro/kg soil). For both FPs, reproductive effects were mainly related to one of its a.i. (s) (azoxystrobin [EC50 = 37 mg azosxystrobin/kg soil] for Amistar, and tebuconazole [EC50 = 41 mg tebuconazole/kg soil] for Prosaro), while lethal effects were not predicted by the toxicity of its a.i. (s) (particularly in the case of Prosaro, which was more toxic than its a.i. (s)). These findings highlight the need to further explore the toxicity data of the FPs compared to the a.i.

(Asteraceae) against larvae and engorged adult females of Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille, 1806)",PARASITES & VECTORS,"Background: The tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus is the species with the largest worldwide distribution and is proven to be involved in the transmission of pathogens such as Babesia canis, Ehrlichia canis, Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia ricketsii, Rickettsia conorii, among others. Studies have demonstrated acquisition of resistance to some of the active principles used in commercial formulations of acaricides. Tagetes patula (Asteraceae) is a plant with highlighted economic and commercial importance due to the production of secondary metabolites with insecticide and acaricide potential, mainly flavonoids, thiophenes and terpenes. Methods: The in vitro acaricide action of the ethanolic 70% extract from aerial parts of T. patula, obtained by percolation, was evaluated against larvae and engorged adult females of Rhipicephalus sanguineus by immersion test for 5 minutes. The chemical characterization of this extract was done by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), using direct injection of sample. Results: Despite T. patula not proving lethal to adults in any of the concentrations tested, at 50.0 mg/mL oviposition rate decreased by 21.5% and eliminated 99.78% of the larvae. Also it was determined that the best results were obtained with 5 minutes of immersion. From the chromatographic analysis twelve O-glycosylated flavonoids were identified. Conclusions: This is the first report on the acaricidal activity of T. patula extract against Rh. sanguineus. If we consider the application of the product in the environment, we could completely eliminate the larval stage of development of the ixodid Rh. sanguineus.",2012,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-295

This is also the situation in Argentina, where glyphosate formulations are the most commercialized herbicides. It is known that glyphosate formulations are much more toxic than the active ingredient, and this difference in toxicity can be attributed to the adjuvants present in the formula. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare sub-lethal histological effects of the glyphosate formulation Roundup Ultramax and glyphosate active ingredient on Leptodactylus latrans tadpoles at Gosner-stage 36. Semi-static bioassays were performed using 96 h of exposure with Roundup Ultramax formulation (RU; 0.37-5.25 mg a.e./L.), glyphosate (GLY; 3-300 mg/L), and a control group. RU exposure showed an increment in the melanomacrophagic cells (MMc) and melanomacrophagic centers (MMCs) from 0.37 mg a.e./L. GLY exposure showed a significant increment in the number of MMc from 15 mg/L, and of MMCs from 3 mg/L. Also, histopathological lesions were observed in the liver of tadpoles exposed to both, GLY and RU. These lesions included: lipidosis and hepatic congestion, but only RU showed significant differences respect to control, with a LOEC value of 2.22 mg a.e./L for both effects. In sum, this study represents the first evidence of adverse effects of glyphosate and RU formulation on the liver of anuran larvae at concentrations frequently found in the environment.

Leaching of both products was affected significantly by litter-humus treatment; by amount of applied rainwater, and for tebuthiuron, by site. The lack of a humus cover increased the amount of hexazinone at 150 cm by nearly threefold and tebuthiuron by nearly fivefold. The greatest leaching occurred after high applications of water and on the four sites with the lowest pH and base saturation.

Adverse effects were analyzed by means of the isotoxicity curves for lethality, malformations, stage-dependent susceptibility, and ultrastructural features. For all experimental conditions, the CF was more toxic, up to 10 times, than the active ingredient, being the open mouth stage (S. 21) the most susceptible to the herbicide. For continuous treatment conditions, the early embryonic development was the most susceptible to 2,4-D and the LC50s for 96 and 168 h were 9.06 and 7.76 mg L(-1) respectively. In addition, both the active ingredient and the CF were highly teratogenic, resulting in reduced body size, delayed development, microcephaly, agenesis of gills, and abnormal cellular proliferation processes as the main adverse effects. According to US EPA, 2,4-D in agricultural scenarios may be up to three times higher than the NOEC values for teratogenic effects reported in this study. Therefore, they might represent a risk for amphibians.

In addition, effects of life stage, feeding, aging the herbicide, and exposure duration on BO toxicity to daphnids were investigated. Regardless of formulation, life stage, and water quality, BO was found to be extremely to highly toxic to daphnids in standard tests; 48-h EC50 values ranged from 41 to 161 mug/L. Bromoxynil octanoate was the most toxic to neonates in soft water and the least toxic in hard water. The acute toxicities of the three bromoxynil herbicides to a given age group of daphnids were similar within the same water type. Overall, neonates and 7-d-old adults were more sensitive than 14- or 15-d-old adults to each herbicide. Feeding daphnids during the toxicity test significantly decreased BO toxicity compared to not feeding them. Aging BO (as Buctril) in hard water decreased its toxicity, and the rate of deactivation was rapid, with an estimated half-life of biological activity of 13 h. Daphnids immobilized by exposures to toxic BO concentrations for less-than-or-equal-to 6 h recovered their mobility, whereas exposures of 18 and 24 h to BO produced toxic effects in daphnids similar to those exposed for 48 h.

Using a selection of two commercial formulations and the active ingredient, we ran three laboratory studies using C-14-labelled acetamiprid to study the leaching, sorption and mineralisation behaviours of the commercially available neonicotinoid formulations compared to the pure active ingredient. We added C-14-spiked acetamiprid to a sandy loam soil that had received long-term additions of farmyard manure at two rates (10 t/ha/yr and 25 t/ha/yr) and mineral fertilisers, as a control. We found significant differences in acetamiprid mineralisation across both the SOM and chemical treatments. Sorption was primarily impacted by changes in SOM and any differences in leachate recovery were much less significant across both treatment types. The mineralisation of all pesticide formulations was comparatively slow, with < 23 % of any given chemical/soil organic matter combination being mineralised over the experimental period. The highest mineralisation rates occurred in samples with the highest soil organic matter levels. The results also showed that 82.9 % & PLUSMN; 1.6 % of the acetamiprid applied was leached from the soil during repeated simulated rainfall events. This combined with the low sorption values, and the low rates of mineralisation, implies that acetamiprid is highly persistent and mobile within sandy soils.

The effect of this compound and its two active substances, carbendazim and flusilazole, was first evaluated on the mycelial growth of P. aleophilum. Escudo (R)-resistant isolates were estimated at a frequency of 24% in Spanish vineyards. Then, the two active substances were used individually to test their effect on mycelia growth of twelve single-spore cultures originating from six Escudo (R)-resistant isolates. Flusilazole (DMI-triazole) did not inhibit mycelia growth of any single-spore cultures of P. aleophilum. Carbendazim (benzimidazole) used alone allowed the growth of the same single-spore cultures that were also resistant to Escudo (R). AFLP characterization of sensitive and resistant single-spore cultures showed genetic diversity within P. aleophilum isolates but no AFLP markers were associated with resistance. New primers set (L2/R1) were designed to partially amplify the exon 6 of the beta-tubulin gene of P. aleophilum. Two different point mutations resulted in glycine (GGC) or lysine (AAA) replacing the glutamic acid (GAG) at codon 198 of the beta-tubulin gene in some of the resistant single-spore cultures studied.

We designed a laboratory experiment at microcosm level to assess the impact of up to three applications of glyphosate on microbial communities of soils with (H) and without history (NH) of exposure to the herbicide. The overall bacterial community and a specific group, the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), were considered. Control microcosms (no glyphosate) and those with one, two or three applications of the active ingredient (AI, N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine potassium salt) or a commercial formulation (CF, Roundup Full II) were sampled after the final application. A higher respiratory quotient (RQ) was detected with p-coumaric acid as C source for microcosms with three applications (AI or CF) relative to the control. Estimations of abundance of amoA gene (AOB) and 16S rRNA gene (Eubacteria) using Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) indicated no effects of three applications (AI or CF). However, significant differences were detected for the CF when the abundance of AOB was related to Eubacteria. Additionally, a shift in the structure of AOB was detected after three applications of either the AI or the CF.

Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic chelators both support ferric reductase activity (when supplied as Fe(III)-chelates) and inhibit ferric reductase. In the present set of experiments we extend these observations to naturally-occurring chelators and their analogues (desferrioxamine B mesylate, schizokinen, two forms of dihydroxybenzoic acid) and also two formulations of the commonly-used herbicide N-(phoshonomethyl)glycine (glyphosate). The ferric forms of the larger siderophores (desferrioxamine B mesylate, schizokinen) and Fe(III)-N-(phoshonomethyl)glycine (as the isopropylamine salt) all supported rapid rates of ferric reductase activity, while the iron-free forms inhibited reductase activity. The smaller siderophores/siderophore precursors, 2,3- and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids, did not support high rates of reductase in the ferric form but did inhibit reductase activity in the iron-free form. Bioassays indicated that Fe(III)-chelates that supported high rates of ferric reductase activity also supported a large stimulation in the growth of iron-limited cells, and that an excess of iron-free chelator decreased the growth rate. With respect to N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, there were differences between the pure compound (free acid form) and the most common commercial formulation (which also contains isopropylamine) in terms of supporting and inhibiting ferric reductase activity and growth. Overall, these results suggest that photosynthetic organisms that use a reductive strategy for iron acquisition both require, and are potentially simultaneously inhibited by, ferric chelators. Furthermore, these results also may provide an explanation for the frequently contradictory results of N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine application to crops: we suggest that low concentrations of this molecule likely solubilize Fe(III), making it available for plant growth, but that higher (but sub-lethal) concentrations decrease iron acquisition by inhibiting ferric reductase activity.",2010,23,1029,1042,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10534-010-9348-7

So far, many studies have focused on reproductive toxicity on glyphosate which may trigger epigenetic changes through endocrine-mediated mechanisms. Generally, it is critical to identify the glyphosate poisoning status in order to minimize health risks. This paper proposed a machine learning approach using 110 rats samples to identify the glyphosate poisoning status. All rats were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 55 each) in the study. The rats in the blank control group were given 0.9% sodium chloride solution orally for 15 days, while the other groups were administered orally at the dosage of 0.5g/kg of glyphosate once per day for 15 days consecutively. Consequently, the potential of an enhanced fuzzy k nearest neighbor approach was explored through blood routine test to recognize the glyphosate poisoning condition based on the blood indices. A real-life data set was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy (ACC), sensitivity, specificity, and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC). The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in blood routine test indices between the control and the glyphosate groups (p-value < 0.01). It was observed in the feature selection that the most important correlated indices were white blood cell, lymphocyte, intermediate cell, and neutrophil granulocyte. A comparative study with support vector machine and artificial neural networks had shown that the proposed approach could achieve much more promising results with 95.45% ACC, 0.90 MCC, 98.89% sensitivity, and 88.89% specificity. The empirical analysis verifies that the proposed method is promising to act as a new, accurate method for identification of the glyphosate poisoning status in subjects.",2018,6,15653,15662,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2809789

Two processes were used for the plant promutagens evaluation: in vivo activation, applying the insecticide systemically in plants for 4 h and subsequently adding plant metabolites containing extracts to lymphocyte cultures; and in vitro activation, where the insecticide was incubated with Vicia faba S10 mix plus human lymphocyte culture. Direct treatment with the insecticide significantly increased SCE frequency in human lymphocytes (250-750 mg L-1), with cellular death observed at 1000 mg L-1 concentration. Using the extracts of Vicia faba treated with Lannate-90 (R) to treat human lymphocytes, a dose-response relationship was observed. In lymphocyte cultures treated directly with the insecticide for 2 h, a negative response was obtained. When S10 mix was added, SCE frequency did not change significantly. Meanwhile, a mixture of S9 mammalian metabolic mix and Lannate-90 (R) increased the SCE frequency, with an observed concentration-dependent response. Although Lannate-90 (R) induced cellular death at the highest concentrations, it did not cause a delay in cell proliferation in any of the treatments, confirming its genotoxic action.

Acute and chronic toxicity tests were carried out with the diuron and carbofuran active ingredients and their commercial products, Diuron Nortox (R) 500 SC and Furadan (R) 350 SC, respectively. Individual toxicity tests showed that C. silvestrii was more sensitive to both carbofuran and diuron than P. caudatum. In single exposures, both pesticides caused adverse effects to C. silvestrii in environmentally relevant concentrations (48 h EC50 = 0.001 mg L-1 and 8 d LOEC = 0.00038 mg L-1 for formulated carbofuran; 8 d LOEC < 0.05 mg L-1 for formulated diuron). For P. caudatum, carbofuran and diuron in single exposures were only slightly toxic (24 h IC50 = 5.1 mg L-1 and 6.9 mg L-1 for formulated carbofuran and diuron, respectively). Acute and chronic exposures to diuron and carbofuran mixtures caused significant deviations of the toxicity predicted by the Concentration Addition and Independent Action reference models for both test species. For the protozoan P. caudatum, a dose-dependent deviation was verified for mortality, with synergism caused mainly by carbofuran and antagonism caused mainly by diuron. For protozoan population growth, however, an antagonistic deviation was observed when the active ingredient mixtures were tested. In the case of C. silvestrii, antagonism at low concentrations and synergism at high concentrations were revealed after acute exposure to active ingredient mixtures, whereas for reproduction an antagonistic deviation was found. Commercial formulation mixtures presented significantly higher toxicity than the active ingredient mixtures. Our results showed that carbofuran and diuron interact and cause different toxic responses than those predicted by the individually tested compounds. Their mixture toxicity should therefore be considered in risk assessments as these pesticides are likely to be present simultaneously in edge-of-field waterbodies.",2020,201,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110829

An herbicide (Montana (R)) and fungicide (Bravo500 (R)) formulations were investigated and results were compared to the isolated active substances of each formulation (glyphosate and chlorothalonil, respectively). Tests were performed using the invertebrate Folsomia candida as test species and an agricultural natural soil. Degradation rate tests were determined under aerobic conditions at 20 +/- 2 degrees C, using an ecologically relevant concentration of 5 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) of soil for both chemicals. Results demonstrated degradation half-lives (DT50) of 2.2 days forMontana (R) and 2.8 days when pure glyphosate was tested. Values of 1.1 and 2.9 days were registered for Bravo500 (R) and its active substance chlorothalonil, respectively. There were no effects on survival for the tested concentrations of both forms of the herbicide (up to 17.3 mg kg(-1)). However, reproduction was affected, but only by the herbicide formulation, with an estimated EC50 value of 4.63 mg (a.i.) kg(-1). Effects were most unlikely related to glyphosate. For chlorothalonil, both tested forms affected survival and reproduction. The estimated LC50 values were 117 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) and 73.5 mg (a.i.) kg(-1), and the EC50 41.3 mg (a.i.) kg(-1) and 14.9 mg kg(-1) for the formulation and the active ingredient, respectively. The effects of the active ingredient were significantly stronger, indicating the major influence of the active substance in the effects caused also by the formulation.

However, the possible risks of these new nanopesticides to non-target organisms are still sparsely investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a nanoformulation of atrazine (nano_ATZ) to non-target soil invertebrates. The effect was compared with the commercial formulation (Gesaprim (R)) and atrazine (the pure active ingredient, a.i.), using the a.i. in a field concentration range using the soil invertebrate, Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochaeta) as the non-target organisms. The endpoints evaluated included avoidance behaviour (2d), hatching success (11d), survival and reproduction (based on both the standard enchytraeid reproduction test (28d) and on the full life cycle test (46d)). Results showed that enchytraeids avoided soil spiked with Gesaprim and atrazine (a.i.), but not nano_ATZ. While all tested atrazine forms affected the hatching success (11d, early development stage), the toxicity in later stages, as measured in terms of survival and reproduction (46d) showed that Gesaprim was the least toxic (EC10 ca. 200 mg kg(-1)), followed by nano_ATZ (EC10 ca. 180 mg kg(-1)) and atrazine (a.i.) (EC10 ca. 100 mg kg(-1)). These findings are important to nanopesticide regulatory purposes, showing the potential effects of nanoformulation compared to the current commercial non-nano ATZ in a.i. field concentrations, and that information on additional test species and exposure routes are missing, as well as the longer term consequences.",2019,6,1950,1958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9en00242a

As a side effect, however, these insecticides contaminate bodies of water, resulting in damage to aquatic organisms. The development of nanopesticides may be an innovative alternative in the control of agricultural pests, increasing effectiveness and reducing their toxicological effects. Based upon this, the present study has investigated encapsulated DMT in alginate chitosan nanoparticles (nanoDMT) and evaluated its toxicological effects on non-target organisms. The nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, NTA and AFM, as well as being evaluated by the release profile. Nanoparticle toxicity was also evaluated in comparison with DMT, empty nanoparticles and DMT (NP + DMT), and commercial formulations (cDMT), in the embryos and larvae of Danio rerio (zebrafish) according to lethality, morphology, and behavior. The nanoparticle control (NP) showed hydrodynamic size values of 283 +/- 4 nm, a PDI of 0.5 +/- 0.05 and a zeta potential of -31 +/- 0.4 mV. For nanoparticles containing dimethoate, the nanoparticles showed 301 +/- 7 nm size values, a PDI of 0.45 +/- 0.02, a zeta potential of -27.9 +/- 0.2 mV, and an encapsulation of 75 +/- 0.32%, with slow-release overtime (52% after 48 h). The AFM images showed that both types of nanoparticles showed spherical morphology. Major toxic effects on embryo larval development were observed in commercial dimethoate exposure followed by the technical pesticide, predominantly in the highest tested concentrations. With regard to the toxic effects of sodium alginate/chitosan, although there was an increase for LC50-96 h concerning the technical dimethoate, the behavior of the larvae was not affected. The data obtained demonstrate that nanoencapsulated dimethoate reduces the toxicity of insecticides on zebrafish larvae, suggesting that nanoencapsulation may be safer for non-target species, by eliminating collateral effects and thus promoting sustainable agriculture.",2022,27,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.impact.2022.100408

Primextra (R) Gold TZ is the most-used herbicide in this area and it is constituted by two main active ingredients, S-metolachlor (SMOC) and terbuthylazine (TBA) that have exhibited toxicity to aquatic animal species in previous studies. The benthic bivalve species Scrobicularia plana was selected to carry out bioassays because of its capacity to filter pollutants and its important position in the structure and functioning of estuarine communities. Organisms of two size classes (big and small) were exposed individually to a range of concentrations of the mentioned compounds to assess their responses in terms of mortality. S. plana showed a clear higher sensitivity to SMOC (big - LC50 = 40.702 mg/L; small - LC50 = 41.517 mg/L) than to TBA (big - LC50 = 118.590 mg/L; small - LC50 = 108.418 mg/L), and big size class organisms, generally, showed to be more tolerant than the ones of small size class. In order to evaluate contaminated aquatic systems, it is necessary to develop laboratory strategies to rapidly assess the potential impacts of pollutants in the environment and in human health. Thus, a battery of biomarkers was selected, including the activity of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (tGPx), glutathione reductase (GRed) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)) and the lipid peroxidation occurrence (by quantification of TBARS levels). This work reports that GRed and GST activate under the chemicals' exposure at concentrations that surpass the levels for environment protection.

However, most commercial formulations contain additives/adjuvants or are manufactured using microencapsulation which may influence the purification process. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to develop and test a pilot scheme for decontaminating water containing pesticides formulated with antifoaming/defoaming agents. The Freundlich adsorption coefficients of formulation of cyprodinil, a new-generation fungicide, onto the organoclay Cloisite 20A have been determined in the laboratory in order to predict the efficiency of this organoclay in removing the fungicide from waste spray-tank water. Subsequently, the adsorption tests were repeated in the pilot system in order to test the practical operation of the purification scheme. The laboratory adsorption tests successfully predicted the efficiency of the pilot purification system, which removed more than 96% cyprodinil over a few hours. The passing of the organoclay-cyprodinil suspension through a layer of biomass gave 100% recovery of the organoclay at the surface of the biomass after 1 week. The organoclay was composted after the treatment to try to break down the fungicide so as to allow safe disposal of the waste, but cyprodinil was not significantly dissipated after 90 days. The purification scheme proved to be efficient for decontaminating water containing cyprodinil formulated with antifoaming/defoaming agents, but additional treatments for the adsorbed residues still appear to be necessary even for a moderately persistent pesticide such as cyprodinil. Furthermore, a significant conclusion of this study concerns the high influence of pesticide formulations on the process of purification of water containing these compounds, which should be taken into account when developing innovative decontamination schemes, especially for practical applications.",2012,19,1229,1236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0643-9

These animals can biologically control many pests that disturb the crop, as well as increase the income of producers when they are reared in the same area as rice. However, a large variety of pesticides is often used for pest control in conventional irrigated rice crops, and fish are exposed to different pesticide concentrations and active ingredients. Thus, the aim of the current study is to assess the potential risks of these pesticides to freshwater fish (Cyprinus carpio) cultured in integrated rice-fish farming systems. We assessed five pesticides widely used in rice culture. This is the first report on the bioaccumulation of the insecticides lambda-cyhalothrin + thiamethoxam and clorantraniliprole and of the fungicide tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin associated with oxidative stress and with enzymatic and non-enzymatic parameters in edible fish samples reared in integrated in rice-fish farming systems. After 100 days of exposure, lambdacyhalothrin and tebuconazole bioaccumulated in carp muscles. Acethylcholinesterase activity in the brain was lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Overall, the biochemical analyses showed increased responses in the experimental groups in comparison to the controls. Lipid peroxidation levels increased in the liver, gills and muscles. Protein oxidation increased in the liver and muscles. Catalase activity increased in the liver, and glutathione S-transferase increased in the liver, gills and muscles.

This study analyzes the DNA damage caused by Marvel (R) a commercial herbicide through the micronucleus (MN) assay, in meristematic cells of the root of Vicia faba. Roots between 2-3 cm were exposed for 4 hours with 18 and 44 hours of recovery time at different concentrations of Marvel (R), equivalent to the following combinations of atrazine / dicamba: 62.5/31.25; 125/62.5; 250/125; 1000/500; 2000/1000; 3000/1500 and 4000/2000, mg of active ingredient / L of distilled water. Cells were exposed to distilled water as a negative control and potassium dichromate (0.05%) as a positive control under the same experimental conditions. With the exception of the lowest concentration [62.5/31.25 mg of active ingredient / L of distilled water], all concentrations tested showed significant damage (p < 0.05), with respect to the negative control, the damage was greater at 18 hours of recovery, and at 44 hours the damage was decreased at all concentrations tested.

Juvenile African clawed frogs, Xenopus laevis, were exposed to commercial formulations of THX and CLO at high (100 ppm) and low (20 ppm) concentrations of the active ingredient. Mortality, growth, development, liver metabolic enzyme activity, and gene expression endpoints were quantified. Tadpoles (n > 1000) from NF 47 through tail resorption stage (NF 66) were exposed to NEO or to NEO-free media treatments. Liver cell reductase activity and cytotoxicity were quantified by flow cytometry. Compared to control reference gene expressions, levels of expression for NEO receptor subunits, cell structure, function, and decontamination processes were measured by RT-qPCR by using liver and brain. Mortality in THX high was 21.5% compared to the control (9.1%); the metabolic conversion of THX to CLO may explain these results.

Repellent and toxic activity of EOs against crop and stored product pests has been widely investigated in the last decades; however, no information is available on the occurrence of adverse undesirable behavioral responses (i.e. habituation) toward these repellents in target pest species. In this study, stable EO-based nano-emulsions from commercial fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), mint (Mentha x piperita) and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) EOs were developed, and their repellence was tested against a major stored product pest, the lesser grain borer Rhyzopetha dominica. Besides, the occurrence of habituation in R. dominica adults following successive exposure to the repellent formulations was evaluated, considering the main characteristics of this kind of non-associative learning. Nanometric droplet size was achieved for all developed nano-emulsions (<200 nm). All the tested EO-based nano-formulations were repellent to R. dominica, whereas F. vulgare-based nano-emulsions triggered lower repellence both in area choice and arena bioassays. The occurrence of habituation was validated for the strongest repellents, M. piperita and C. sinensis formulations and the decline of R. dominica responses was frequency-dependent. Furthermore, insects completely recovered their responsiveness toward the biopesticides just after 24 h from the end of exposure. The decline of the responsiveness in R. dominica adults was attributable to real learning process, since motor and sensory fatigue were excluded by testing stimulus specificity and dishabituation. The results demonstrated that habituation could occur for repellent EO-based formulations, thus this behavioral process can reduce the effectiveness of these kind of treatments against R. dominica and should be considered to articulate adequate IPM programs against stored product pests.",2021,162,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113257

In this paper, we propose an ecologically-relevant methodology to estimate potential exposure to active substances (ASs) of a farmland focal bird, the gray partridge Perdix perdix. It is based on bird habitat use of fields at the time of pesticide applications. It accounts for spatio-temporal heterogeneity at population and landscape scales. We identify and quantify the potential exposure to 179 ASs of 140 clutches during pre-laying, laying, and incubation phases, and of 75 coveys. The data come from a large scale field study combining radiotelemetry and a farmer survey. They were collected in 12 different representative sites. The proportion of clutches potentially exposed to a given chemical was >= 5% for 32 ASs; prothioconazole and epoxiconazole ranking first. 71% of clutches were potentially exposed to >= 1 AS and 67% to >= 2 ASs. Mixtures involved 2 to 22 ASs. They emerged from commercial formulations, tank mixtures, bird habitat use, and combinations. ASs were fungicides (53%), herbicides (25%), and insecticides (16%) used on a variety of crops in April-June, when ground-nesting birds are breeding. The European Food Safety Authority conclusions report a long-term first-tier toxicity-to-exposure ratio (TERlt) <5 for 11 out of 19 documented ASs, and higher-tier TERlt <5 for 5 out of 10 ASs. This suggests a potential risk for bird reproduction in farmlands. Globally 13% of coveys were potentially exposed to 18 ASs during the first month (1-4 coveys per AS). The use of our field data in future research and risk assessment is discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2015,521,315,325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.03.073

The SRF was designed by incorporating the herbicide in micelles formed by the fatty amine ethoxylated surfactant Ethomeen T/15 (ET15) followed by their further sorption on the clay mineral sepiolite. The content of active substance (a.s.) was very high, 16.8% w.w. The surfactant per se was adsorbed by developing surface aggregates on sepiolite's surface. FTIR spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements demonstrated that electrostatic interactions were responsible of the sorption of MS by using micelles loaded with the herbicide, modifying the conformation of ET15 on sepiolite. Toxicity assays by using Microtox (R) tests yielded a value of IC50 for the SRF (52.6 +/- 3.6 mg L-1) that was one order of magnitude higher than that reported for the commercial formulation Callisto (R) (1.1 +/- 0.1 mg L-1). In vitro water release experiments stated that the release of MS was a controlled-diffusion process. Application of SRF and Callisto (R) as post-emergence in field trials of maize showed that after 10 days of treatment (DAT), the amount in the soil of the herbicide from the SRF was about two-fold higher than that of Callisto (R), with a larger accumulation (42% of the total) in the upper soil layer (0-10 cm depth). No significant differences in soil accumulation at longer times and in the crop yield were observed.

Risk assessments are usually based on the pure active ingredient and not on the formulated products applied in the environment. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how azoxystrobin, the best-selling strobilurin fungicide, affects non-target soil organisms Enchytraeus albidus. To investigate the effects of the different types of azoxystrobin, E. albidus was exposed to the pure active ingredient, AZO_AI, and the formulated product, AZO_FP. Survival, reproduction, and molecular biomarkers of E. albidus were determined for different exposure durations (seven and 21 days). AZO_FP (LC50 = 15.3 mg(a.i.)/kg) showed a slightly stronger effect on survival than AZO_AI (LC50 = 16.8 mg(a.i.)/kg), yet the impact on reproduction was much stronger. Namely, while the tested concentrations of AZO_AI (EC50 >= 8 mg(a.i.)/kg) had almost no effect on reproduction, AZO_FP (EC50 = 2.9 mg(a.i.)/kg) significantly inhibited reproduction in a dose-dependent manner. Changes in enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase) and malondialdehyde levels in both treatments indicated oxidative stress. Although AZO_FP had a stronger negative effect, the impact depended on the exposure time and the tested concentration. The higher toxicity of AZO_FP was a consequence of increased bioavailability and activity of the active ingredient due to the presence of adjuvants. Overall stronger adverse effects of AZO_FP suggest that the toxicity of azoxystrobin in the agricultural environment on the enchytraeid population may be underestimated. Furthermore, the results of this study highlighted the importance of comparing the toxicity of the active ingredient and the formulated product.",2022,187,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.105198

Under optimized conditions (60/40 (v/v) ACN/0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 20 mu L/min), it was possible to obtain baseline separation for most of the studied compounds. The analysis of an enantiomerically pure mecoprop commercial herbicide sample which also contained three achiral phenoxy acid herbicides (MCPA, 2,4-D and dicamba) commonly present in these kinds of formulations showed that the use of a 80/20 (v/v) ACN/0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.3) enabled the simultaneous separation of these compounds and mecoprop enantiomers in less than 8 min. The analytical characteristics of the methodology were evaluated in terms of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, LOD, and LOQ Results demonstrated that determined amounts of R-mecoprop in commercial formulations were in agreement with the labeled content and the enantiomeric impurity was below the LOQ, The poly(MQD-co-HEMA-co-EDMA) capillary monolithic column exhibits great potential as a useful and environmental-friendly tool for the quality control of agrochemicals by nano-LC.

R showed higher total phosphorus (TP) and ammonium nitrogen (N-NH4+) concentrations due to the herbicide input, and a significant increase in algal abundance, biovolume and chlorophyll a levels (Chl-a). In M mussels grazed on phytoplanlcton, which resulted in subsequent phosphates (SRP) release. A decrease in species diversity was observed in R and M with respect to C. In MR, there were higher TP and N-NH4+ concentrations, a decrease in biovolume, an antagonistic effect on Chl-a and a synergistic effect on phytoplankton abundance. Species diversity and evenness showed a significant decrease due to the explosive growth of a small and opportunistic Chlorophyta, Spermatozopsis exsultans.

It is effective against spore germination, mycelial growth and sporulation. It is recommended as preventive treatments but also provides curative activity during the incubation period. After foliar application, a large amount of the active ingredient is absorbed in the cuticular wax layer ensuring excellent rain-fastness. The uptake into plant tissues is sufficient to provide good translaminar activity. During 2006 and 2007 summers, experimentation was performed, according to EPPO guidelines and Principles of Good Experimental Practice (GEP), aiming at establishing the biological efficacy and the selectivity of Mandipropamid + cupper oxychloride 2.50/13.95 (formulate A14781, Syngenta Crop Protection) on tomato against Phytophthora infestans.

This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a previously developed bioremediation tool for atrazine-contaminated soils (combining bioaugmentation with Pseudomonas sp. ADP, hereafter designated as P. ADP, and biostimulation with citrate) on both soil habitat and retention functions, by performing ecotoxicological tests with standard soil and aquatic species. Soil microcosms (incorporating earthworms, collembolans, and plants) were spiked with three doses of Atrazerba FL, an atrazine commercial formulation: the recommended dose (RD; 2 L/ha), 10 x RD and 20 x RD to simulate overuse/accidental spills scenarios. The experiment included two main groups of treatments: (1) microcosms sprayed solely with Atrazerba, i.e., nonbioremediated soils (NB) and (2) microcosms sprayed with both Atrazerba and the bioremediation tool (addition of P. ADP plus citrate), i.e., bioremediated soils (B). Control microcosms with no herbicide or P. ADP plus citrate addition were also set up. Besides soil chemical analysis, the following ecotoxicological endpoints were assessed to monitor bioremediation: plant biomass production, earthworm reproduction, microalgae growth (in eluates-collected 5 and 10 days after the bioremediation treatment-and leachates-collected on day seven), and cladoceran reproduction (in soil eluates). In NB soils, all Atrazerba doses induced a severe reduction in plant biomass production, and no effects were found for earthworm's reproduction. Eluates and leachates obtained from the NB soils caused deleterious effects on both microalgae growth and cladoceran reproduction. Chemical analysis showed that atrazine degradation was faster in B soils than in the correspondent NB soils. Data from toxicity tests indicated that test organism performance was enhanced in B soils and respective eluates and leachates, compared to the NB samples. In fact, for soils contaminated with 10 and 20 x RD Atrazerba doses, plant biomass production was significantly higher in the B soils than in the correspondent NB soils. Regarding the effects of soil bioremediation on the toxicity of soil eluates and leachates, for the soil contaminated with 10 x RD of Atrazerba, over a 5-day treatment period, both microalgae growth and cladoceran reproduction were significantly higher in water extracts obtained from the B soils when compared with the NB extracts and also similar to the control. By the contrary, for the highest Atrazerba dose tested (20 x RD), no significant differences were found on the toxicity of B and NB eluates toward both aquatic test organisms. However, for this same dose, after 7 days, microalgae growth was higher in B than in the NB leachates and similar to the control. Yet, after a longer bioremediation period of 10 days, eluates were also no longer toxic to both aquatic organisms. Based on atrazine soil chemical analysis, one can state that the addition of P. ADP plus citrate to the atrazine-contaminated soils was clearly effective in promoting atrazine biodegradation. In addition, ecotoxicological data support the efficacy of this cleanup tool. Indeed, results showed that the bioremediation treatment resulted in a relevant reduction on soil toxicity to a plant (approximately 100% and 72% of control, respectively, for 10 x RD and 20 x RD contaminated soils). In addition, 5 days of P. ADP activity were enough to annul atrazine toxic effects toward microalgae and cladocerans in eluates obtained from the soil contaminated with 10 x RD of Atrazerba. For 20 x RD, an effective detoxification of eluates was achieved only after a longer bioremediation period of 10 days. The ecotoxicity tests proved not only the effective detoxification of bioremediated soils in 10 days but also the potential ability to concurrently reduce atrazine contamination of water compartments due to leaching and/or run-off events, to levels that may no longer be hazardous to ecosystems. Due to the worldwide continued use of atrazine/triazine-based herbicidal formulations, further studies viewing the optimization of this cost-effective cleanup tool at larger scales (mesocosm and real field scenarios) and testing of other commercial formulations containing mixtures of atrazine/triazine and other active ingredient are still needed so that bioremediation can be used as a valuable tool to reduce herbicide toxicity in contaminated land.",2010,10,568,578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0145-2

In the present study, in vivo and in vitro studies were carried out using the early life stages of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the cell line RTL-W1 (a liver cell line from rainbow trout) to characterize the toxic effects of glyphosate at environmentally-realistic concentrations. Both studies were performed using the commercial formulation Roundup (R) GT Max, and technical-grade glyphosate for the in vitro study. Eyed-stage embryos were exposed for 3 weeks to sub-lethal concentrations (0.1 and 1 mg/L) of glyphosate using Roundup. Numerous toxicity endpoints were recorded such as survival, hatching success, larval biometry, developmental abnormalities, swimming activity, genotoxicity (formamidopyrimidine DNA-glycosylase Fpg-modified comet assay), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), protein carbonyls and target gene transcription. Concentrations neither affected embryonic or larval survival nor increased developmental abnormalities. However, a significant decrease was observed in the head size of larvae exposed to 1 mg/L of glyphosate. In addition, a significant increase in mobility was observed for larvae exposed to glyphosate at 0.1 mg/L. TSARS levels were significantly decreased on larvae exposed to 1 mg/L (a.i.), and cat and cox1 genes were differently transcribed from controls. DNA damage was detected by the Fpg-modified comet assay in RTL-W1 cell line exposed to the technical-grade glyphosate and Roundup formulation.

Plants containing pesticides residues may then reach the soil during the crop cycle or after harvest. However, the fate in soil of pesticides residues in plants is unknown. Two commonly used foliar herbicides, glyphosate and sulcotrione, C-14-labeled, were applied on leaves of oilseed rape and/or maize, translocation was studied, and then soil incubations of aerial parts of plants containing herbicides residues were performed. Soil treated directly with herbicides was used as control. The effects of adjuvants on herbicide plant-absorption and subsequent soil-degradation were also investigated comparing herbicides application as active ingredients and as commercial formulations. The fate in soil of herbicides residues in plants was different from that of control, and different for glyphosate and sulcotrione. Mineralization in soil of glyphosate in crops decreased compared to control, and amounts of C-14-extractable residues, mainly composed by the metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and non-extractable residues (NER) increased. In contrast, mineralization in soil of sulcotrione in maize increased compared to control, with a decrease in the C-14-extractable residues and an increase in NER. The fate of both herbicides was influenced by the type of plant organ in which herbicide was incorporated, because of differences in herbicides bioavailability and organs biodegradability, but not by adjuvants. Absorption of both herbicides in plant delays their subsequent soil-degradation, and particularly, glyphosate persistence in soil could increase from two to six times.

Biochemical, physiological, and genotoxic biomarkers were evaluated in different organs of the fish. Exposure to CL induced significant changes in the enzymatic profiles of P. lineatus, with specific alterations in biotransformation enzymes and antioxidant defence in different tissues. Lipid peroxidation was observed in fish gills and kidney. Increases in esterases were observed in the liver of fish exposed to all CL concentrations evaluated, whereas acetylcholinesterase activity decreased in the muscles of fish at all concentrations. CL also promoted osmoregulatory disorders, with decreases in calcium and magnesium gill ATPases, with consequent hypocalcaemia, in addition an increase in sodium-potassium ATPase activity was observed in the gills of fish exposed to the highest CL concentration, probably in order to compensate a reduction in plasma sodium. Besides, increases in DNA damage were observed in the erythrocytes of fish exposed to all CL concentrations. Thus, despite the low CL concentrations and the short exposure time, this pyrethroid caused hematological adjustments, oxidative stress, osmoregulatory disorders, and DNA damage in P. lineatus, showing that the species is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of CL.

Ethylene glycols and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are often contained in commercial formulations, because they are good solvents and not toxic. Since they are humectants, the water content of the formulation residue varies with humidity of the air. At 25 degrees C and 65% relative humidity PEG 400 contains about 50% water. The partition coefficients for the lipophilic herbicide, bifenox, increased with increasing water content of the ethylene glycols and PEGs, such that log K was a linear function of the mass fraction of water or PEG. The K value was about 0.5 for the system cuticle/pure PEG and 27 500 for the system cuticle/water. When PEG contained 50% water, K was only 110. Partition coefficients of bifenox between cuticle and 'Tween' 80 depended also on humidity, having values of 0.75 in cuticle/pure 'Tween' 80 and 29.1 when 'Tween' 80 contained 50% water. With 1-naphthylacetic acid (NAA), which is a weak acid, partition coefficients also depended on water content of PEG 400, but a maximum curve was obtained. The maximum partition coefficient (211) was observed with a mixture of 30% PEG 400 and 70% water, which corresponded to a humidity of 88%. We suggest that this is due to an effect of PEG 400 on the ionisation of NAA. Our data demonstrate that partition coefficients are affected by humidity, because solubilities of lipophilic compounds and weak acids in PEG/water mixtures vary greatly with the water content. This in turn affects driving forces, mainly by the effect of humidity on partition coefficient. With non-ionisable lipophilic compounds, partition coefficients, driving forces and rates of foliar uptake therefore increase with increasing humidity.

The shallow tidal creeks and ditches that directly drain agricultural fields are home to the young of the ecologically and economically important blue crab, Callinectes sapidus (Rathbun, 1896). Massive mortality observed by peeler crab fishers led us to investigate the acute toxicity of several commercial pesticide formulations and their active ingredients to blue crab megalopae and J1-J4 stage juveniles. Twenty-four hour acute toxicity assays were conducted with the organophosphate acephate (Orthene (R)), the carbamate aldicarb, the chloro-nicotinyl imidacloprid (Trimax (TM)), the pyrethroid lambdacyhalothrin (Karate (R) with Zeon Technology), and the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup (R) Pro. LC50 values ranged from 0.22 mu g/L for megalopae exposed to lambda-cyhalothrin to 316,000 mu g/L for juveniles exposed to Roundup. The acute toxicities of active ingredient insecticides to blue crabs followed the order: lambda-cyhalothrin > imidacloprid approximate to aldicarb > acephate. Megalopae were almost always more sensitive than juveniles and there was little difference between the LC(50)s of each commercial formulation and its active ingredient. Treatment of intermolt megalopae with LC20 levels of Roundup resulted in significantly reduced time to metamorphosis (TTM) compared to estuarine water controls, while no differences resulted from treatment with the four active ingredient insecticides. Treatment with acephate, aldicarb, imidacloprid, and Roundup significantly increased the frequency of juveniles that died within 6 h of molting. The sensitivity of molting blue crabs to these pesticides makes frequently molting juveniles particularly vulnerable to pesticides in estuaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the present study addressed the herbicide Roundup(A (R)), evaluating the relative contribution of the active ingredient (glyphosate) and the surfactant (polyethoxylated amine; POEA) to the genotoxicity of the commercial formulation on Anguilla anguilla. Fish were exposed to equivalent concentrations of Roundup(A (R)) (58, 116 mu g L-1), glyphosate (17.9, 35.7 mu g L-1) and POEA (9.3, 18.6 mu g L-1), during 1 and 3 days. The comet assay was applied to blood cells, either as the standard procedure, or with an extra step involving DNA lesion-specific repair enzymes in an attempt to clarify DNA damaging mechanisms. The results confirmed the genotoxicity of Roundup(A (R)), also demonstrating the genotoxic potential of glyphosate and POEA individually. Though both components contributed to the overall genotoxicity of the pesticide formulation, the sum of their individual effects was never observed, pointing out an antagonistic interaction. Although POEA is far from being considered biologically inert, it did not increase the risk associated to glyphosate when the two were combined. The analysis of oxidatively induced breaks suggested that oxidation of DNA bases was not a dominant mechanism of damage. The present findings highlighted the risk posed to fish populations by the assessed chemicals, jointly or individually, emphasizing the need to define regulatory thresholds for all the formulation components and recommending, in particular, the revision of the hazard classification of POEA.",2012,21,1381,1390,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-012-0892-5

Despite the importance of phytoplankton and periphyton communities at the base of the aquatic food webs, fewer studies have investigated the effects of glyphosate on freshwater microbial assemblages. We assessed the effect of the commercial formulation Roundup using artificial earthen mesocosms. The herbicide was added at three doses: a control (without Roundup) and two treatments of 6 and 12 mg/L of the active ingredient (glyphosate). Estimates of the dissipation rate (k) were similar in the two treatments (half-lives of 5.77 and 7.37 d, respectively). The only two physicochemical parameters showing statistically significant differences between treatments and controls were the downward vertical spectral attenuation coefficient kd(lambda), where lambda is wavelength, and total phosphorus concentration (TP). At the end of the experiment, the treated mesocosms showed a significant increase in the ratio k(d)(490 nm)/k(d)(550 nm) and an eightfold increase in TP. Roundup affected the structure of phytoplankton and periphyton assemblages. Total micro- and nano-phytoplankton decreased in abundance in treated mesocosms. In contrast, the abundance of picocyanobacteria increased by a factor of about 40. Primary production also increased in treated mesocosms (roughly by a factor of two). Similar patterns were observed in the periphytic assemblages, which showed an increased proportion of dead : live individuals and increased abundances of cyanobacteria (about 4.5-fold). Interestingly, the observed changes in the microbial assemblages were captured by the analysis of the pigment composition of the phytoplankton, the phytoplankton absorption spectra, and the analysis of the optical properties of the water. The observed changes in the structure of the microbial assemblages are more consistent with a direct toxicological effect of glyphosate rather than an indirect effect mediated by phosphorus enrichment.",2007,17,2310,2322,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0499.1

A short-term pot study was carried out using factorial treatments that included two different compositions of forage plant species (triticale versus a mixture of triticale and pea) and two concentrations of glyphosate (50 and 500 mg active ingredient kg(-1) soil, as a commercial formulation, Roundup Plus) arranged in a completely randomized design experiment with four replicates. Control plants (no glyphosate added) were clipped in an attempt to compare two methods of weed control (manual = clipping; chemical = herbicide treatment). Rhizosphere soil was sampled 15 and 30 days after glyphosate treatment and the following soil components were determined: potentially mineralizable nitrogen, ammonium content, community-level physiological profiles using Biolog Ecoplates (TM), DNA microbial biomass and genotype diversity by means of PCR-DGGE. Fifteen days after herbicide treatment, a glyphosate-induced stimulation of the activity and functional diversity of the cultivable portion of the heterotrophic soil microbial community was observed, most likely due to glyphosate acting as an available source of C, N and P. On the other hand, 30 days after herbicide treatment, both the activity and diversity of the rhizosphere soil microbial communities showed an inconsistent response to glyphosate addition. Apart from its intended effect on plants, glyphosate had non-target effects on the rhizosphere soil microbial community which were, interestingly, more enhanced in triticale than in triticale + pea pots. Biolog (TM) was more sensitive than PCR-DGGE to detect changes in soil microbial communities induced by glyphosate and plant composition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, there is an urgent need for an evaluation of metabolic effects of new pesticide ingredients used to replace glyphosate. As the liver is a primary target of chemical pollutant toxicity, we have used the HepaRG human liver cell line as a model system to assess the toxicological insult from quizalofop-p-ethyl, isoxaflutole, mesotrione and glyphosate by determining alterations in the transcriptome caused by exposure to three concentrations of each of these compounds, including a low environmentally relevant dose. RNA-seq data were analysed with HISAT2, StringTie and Ballgown. Quizalofop-p-ethyl was found to be the most toxic of the pesticide ingredients tested, causing alterations in gene expression that are associated with pathways involved in fatty acid degradation and response to alcoholism. Isoxaflutole was less toxic, but caused detectable changes in retinol metabolism and in the PPAR signalling pathway at a concentration of 1 mM. ToxCast data analysis revealed that isoxaflutole activated PPAR gamma receptor and pregnane X responsive elements in reporter gene assays. Glyphosate and mesotrione caused subtle changes in transcriptome profiles, with too few genes altered in their function to allow a reliable pathway analysis. In order to explore the effects of glyphosate in greater depth and detail, we undertook a global metabolome profiling. This revealed a decrease in free long chain fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acid levels at the lowest concentration (0.06 mu M) of glyphosate, although no effects were detected at the two higher concentrations tested, perhaps suggesting a non-linear dose response. This surprising result will need to be confirmed by additional studies. Overall, our findings contribute to filling the knowledge gap regarding metabolic toxicity that can potentially arise from exposure to these four herbicide active principles.",2018,5,819,826,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2018.08.005

Although the need for the assessment of health and environmental hazards deriving from the interactions between various substances found in commercial pesticide formulations is becoming increasingly recognized, the approval of pesticide products is still mostly limited to determining the toxicity of the individual ingredients ignoring the possible combined effects in mixtures. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature of in vitro and in vivo studies that simultaneously examine the toxicity of pesticide product formulations and their declared active ingredients to compare their toxicity to human health and to the environment. Two electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed the health effects of active pesticide ingredients and their product formulations. The literature search was performed with a combination of the following terms: pesticide, formulation, commercial product, commercial pesticide and health. After screening by predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality and reliability assessment of eligible publications was conducted by use of the ToxRTool. Two investigators independently screened the identified publications and extracted results from eligible studies. Our search yielded 36 toxicity studies; 23 studies investigated herbicides, 15 examined insecticides and 4 focused on fungicides. Twenty-four studies reported increased toxicity of the product formulations versus their active ingredients, which, in most cases, were attributed to the presence of adjuvants in the formulations. A significant number (n = 10) of studies focused on the comparative testing of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, and six of them concluded that Roundup, the dominant product formulation of glyphosate, is more toxic than the active ingredient alone. We identified only 8 studies demonstrating reduced toxicity of product formulations in relation to the active ingredient that might be due to a potential antagonistic effect between the constituents. The results of this review demonstrate the inadequacy of current EU testing requirements for assessing the health hazards of pesticide product formulations based mainly on the evaluation of the individual ingredients and of at least one representative use and formulation. Ignoring the possible risks deriving from the interaction between the active and other ingredients of various commercial pesticide product formulations might result in the misinterpretation of its toxicological profile. At EU level efforts are currently made to address this issue. In this context, we recommend that all product formulations should be fully assessed during the authorization process.",2020,181,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108926

The release kinetics of the developed Mancozeb CR formulations were studied and compared with that of commercially available 42% suspension concentrate and 75% wettable powder. Maximum amount of Mancozeb was released on 42nd day for PEG-600 and octyl chain, PEG-1000 and octyl chain, and PEG-600 and hexadecyl chain, on 35th day for PEG-1000 and hexadecyl chain, on 28th day for PEG-1500 and octyl chain, PEG-2000 and octyl chain, PEG-1500 and hexadecyl chain, and PEG-2000 and hexadecyl chain in comparison to both commercial formulations (15th day). The diffusion exponent (n value) of Mancozeb in water ranged from 0.42 to 0.62 in tested formulations. The half-release (t(1/2)) values ranged from 17.35 to 35.14 days, and the period of optimum availability of Mancozeb ranged from 18.54 to 35.42 days. Further, the in vitro bioefficacy evaluation of developed formulations was done against plant pathogenic fungi Alternaria solani and Sclerotium rolfsii by poison food technique. Effective dose for 50% inhibition in mgL(-1) (ED50) values of developed formulations varied from 1.31 to 2.79 mg L-1 for A. solani, and 1.60 to 3.14 mg L-1 for S. rolfsii. The present methodology is simple, economical, and ecofriendly for the development of environment-friendly CR formulations of Mancozeb. These formulations can be used to optimize the release of Mancozeb to achieve disease control for the desired period depending upon the matrix of the polymer used.

We carried out two experiments using microcosms under laboratory conditions for 7 days each. In the first experiment, we analyzed changes in species composition, abundance and chlorophyll a of phytoplankton due to 10 treatments: control; low, medium and high concentrations of G and 2,4-D; and mixtures at low, medium and high concentrations at a G:2,4-D ratio of 1:0.45. In the second experiment we studied changes on the composition of the autotrophic fraction and abundance, chlorophyll a, dry weight (DW), ash free dry weight (AFDW) and autotrophic index of periphyton developed in artificial substrata under 7 treatments considering the lowest doses that showed an effect in the previous phytoplankton experiment: control; pure G and Glifosato Atanor (R) (glyphosate-based formulation); pure 2,4-D and Asi Max 50 (R) (2,4-D based formulation); mixtures of the a.i at a G:2,4-D ratio of 1:0.45, and mixture of Glifosato Atanor(.)(R) + Asi Max (R). Results showed that G was more toxic than 2,4-D to the algal fraction, decreasing chlorophyll a, turbidity and algal abundances in the phytoplankton experiment. The effects of the mixture on phytoplankton were mainly additive, except for total and Staurastrum sp. live abundances where an antagonistic effect between herbicides was recorded. Periphyton showed more resistance to the herbicides as it was less affected than phytoplankton by the active ingredients and commercial formulations. The high development of Leptolyngbya sp. due to the impact of the herbicide mixture on periphyton might represent the beginning of a more conspicuous community to prevent the impact of contaminants.

CLS management practices include the application of the sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides tetraconazole, difenoconazole, and prothioconazole. Evaluating resistance to DMIs is a major focus for CLS fungicide resistance management. Isolates were collected in 1997 and 1998 (baseline sensitivity to tetraconazole, prothioconazole, or difenoconazole) and 2007 through 2010 from the major sugar-beet-growing regions of Minnesota and North Dakota and assessed for in vitro sensitivity to two or three DMI fungicides. Most (47%) isolates collected in 1997-98 exhibited 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for tetraconazole of <0.01 mu g ml(-1), whereas no isolates could be found in this EC50 range in 2010. Since 2007, annual median and mean tetraconazole EC50 values have generally been increasing, and the frequency of isolates with EC50 values >0.11 mu g m(-1) increased from 2008 to 2010. In contrast, the frequency of isolates with EC50 values for prothioconazole of >1.0 mu g ml(-1) has been decreasing since 2007. Annual median difenoconazole EC50 values appears to be stable, although annual mean EC50 values generally have been increasing for this fungicide. Although EC50 values are import ant for gauging fungicide sensitivity trends, a rigorous comparison of the relationship between in vitro EC50 values and loss of fungicide efficacy in planta has not been conducted for C. beticola. To explore this, 12 isolates exhibiting a wide range of tetraconazole EC50 values were inoculated to sugar beet but no tetraconazole was applied. No relationship was found between isolate EC50 value and disease severity. To assess whether EC50 values are related to fungicide efficacy in planta, sugar beet plants were sprayed with various dilutions of Eminent. the commercial formulation of tetraconazole, and subsequently inoculated with isolates that exhibited very low, medium, or high tetraconazole EC50 values. The high EC50 isolate caused significantly more disease than isolates with medium or very low EC50 values at the field application rate and most reduced rates. Because in vitro sensitivity testing is typically carried out with the active ingredient of the commercial fungicide, we investigated whether loss of disease control was the same for tetraconazole as for the commercial product Eminent.

A surface water flow rate of 740 L/min was maintained in the system using a pump. The plant community within the system consisted primarily of Panicum repens, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and Bacopa caroliniana. Norflurazon and simazine, derived from commercial formulations, were injected (51.1 g active ingredient each) directly into the water pumped into the wetland over a 2 h period.

The BIC also reacts with butylamine to form N,N'-dibutylurea (DBU), a phytotoxic compound. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of selected additives and the manufacturing method of benomyl water dispersible granules (WG) on reducing DBU content in benomyl formulations. The manufacturing methods studied were granulation by extrusion, fluid bed spray, and spray dry. For the extrusion method, each benomyl powder formulation was homogenized by kneading with 20% v/w of 95% ethanol instead of water. After granulation, the percentages of the active ingredient benomyl and its degradation product carbendazim in each formulation were determined. For the fluid bed spray method, two formulations of wettable powders were formed. The first sample was granulated using 5% Na2SO4 as the binder solution; the second sample used 2% urea. Changes in the active ingredient content after granulation were determined for each sample. For the spray dry method, four basic formulations of 70% benomyl, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 10% or 20% sodium sulfate were prepared, to study the effects of HMTA, urea and dispersant on reducing DBU formation in formulation. The DBU content of each formulation was measured for the fresh samples and after 1 year of storage. The results showed that urea had a stabilizing effect on benomyl, and reduced DBU formation. BIC increased benomyl yield during manufacturing, which reduced DBU content in fresh samples but allowed a greater potential for future DBU formation since it did not stabilize the extra benomyl. HMTA was found to reduce DBU in both aqueous BIC and prepared formulations. The study discusses how each of the selected constituents affected DBU formation and how commercial formulations can be improved to reduce DBU formation. From this study, it is clear that a safer benomyl formulation can be developed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007,68,1465,1473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.03.032

One example is Betanal (R) Expert, a postemergence herbicide composed of an Advanced Micro Droplet coformulation of phenmedipham, desmedipham, and ethofumesate. Although its composed formulation brings an increase in the pesticide performance, it can also enhance its toxicity to nontarget species. Therefore, the present study intends to contribute with relevant information on ecotoxicological effects of Betanal (R) Expert and its active ingredients on a battery of bioassays using aquatic species from different trophic levels: bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), microalgae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Chlorella vulgaris, and Chlamydomonas pseudocostata), macrophyte (Lemna minor), and cladocerans (Daphnia magna and Daphnia longispina) species. Across the organisms tested and endpoints measured, different responses concerning the toxicity of the active ingredients were found: (i) phenmedipham was the most toxic to V. fischeri and L. minor; (ii) desmedipham was the most toxic to P. subcapitata, D. magna, and D. longispina; (iii) and ethofumesate was the most toxic to C. pseudocostata and C. vulgaris. Furthermore, for C. pseudocostata and daphnids, the toxicity observed for some active ingredients was higher than the toxicity of the commercial formulation. In fact, in an attempt to evaluate the contribution of each active ingredient to the overall toxicity of Betanal (R) Expert, it was observed that, in general, the toxicity values obtained for desmedipham and phenmedipham were close or even lower to the values determined for Betanal (R) Expert, indicating that the ethofumesate can act as an antagonist in the three-way coformulation. In spite of the most impaired species being the photosynthetic ones, this study also showed pernicious effects on nonphotosynthetic organisms with distinct target sites. Therefore, our results underline the importance of clarifying the mode of action and metabolic pathways of these compounds on nonphotosynthetic species. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Among the non-target terrestrial organisms exposed to such scenarios, earthworms are key ecological receptors widely used in ecotoxicological studies. As such, this work aims to assess the effects of two herbicide active ingredients (a.i.)-sulcotrione and penoxsulam-and their respective commercial formulations-MIKADOA (R) and VIPERA (R) (referred as Mikado and Viper)-on the avoidance behaviour of Eisenia andrei. In an attempt to enhance the ecological relevance of the generated toxicity data, the avoidance tests were run with standard (LUFA 2.2; L) and natural soils (from corn and rice fields), as long as their habitat function did not constrain the earthworm behaviour. Earthworms were bred in the lab before test conductance. The natural soils used as substrates were collected before the cropping season on corn (C) and rice (R) fields, which are integrated in a wide area exploited for agriculture. Their physico-chemical characterization evolved the determination of pH (H2O, KCl), conductivity, organic matter (OM) and clay/silt contents, and water-holding capacity (WHC). The avoidance tests intended to ascertain (1) the random distribution of earthworms in the natural soils C and R (dual-control tests), (2) the habitat function of natural soils against each other and against L soil, (3) the effect of active ingredients and formulated herbicides on E. andrei behaviour. Avoidance tests with the a.i.s were only performed in L soil. Data evaluation followed ISO (2005) guidelines. C and R soils presented higher OM (5.1% and 4.5%, respectively) and clay/silt (53.3 and 43.1, respectively) contents and WHC (107.2 and 109.9%, respectively) than L soil (4.1, 21.4 and 48.0%, correspondingly). Earthworms distributed randomly in dual-control tests, but preferred R soil significantly, relative to L or C soils. The LOEC and EC50 values calculated for sulcotrione (> 1,000.0 and 1,263.3 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) and Mikado (1,012.8 and 1,301.3 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) were much higher than those calculated for penoxsulam (100 and 80.6 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively) or Viper (52.7 and 51.5 mg a.i. kg(-1), respectively), when L soil was used as substrate. Moreover, the habitat function of L soil contaminated with the formulated herbicide Viper was more constrained relative to that of the a.i. penoxsulam. Viper induced higher % avoidance on E. andrei exposed to the contaminated L soil compared to that under the R soil. The response of earthworms to R (attraction) and C (avoidance) soils could be related, not only to the quantity of OM content, but also to the quality of organic and inorganic fractions of soil, beyond other intrinsic properties of soils. Both Mikado and sulcotrione impacted the behaviour of E. andrei only slightly. This endpoint was more affected under penoxsulam or Viper exposures on L soil, being the latter-formulated product even more repellent for E. andrei than the a.i. The effect of adjuvants added to the commercial formulation of Viper, may have increased the toxicity of the a.i. Thereby, our results reinforce the need for a careful assessment of the impacts of formulated products. Furthermore, since there was a reduction in earthworm % avoidance under Viper exposures on the natural soil R, it was possible that pesticide bioavailability had been reduced by its sorption to OM and clay mineral sorption sites. Though the standard L soil should be used for reproducibility and comparison means, other natural soils should be added to the assessment of chemicals, for sake of ecological relevance. Both herbicides induced avoidance behaviour on E. andrei, albeit stronger effects were denoted by penoxsulam and its respective formulated product, Viper. Overall, avoidance tests provided a sensitive, valuable and feasible response either to compare the habitat function of different standard and agricultural natural soils or to test the effect of herbicides. An effort should be made to enlarge the terrestrial ecotoxicological database as a way to fulfil the huge lack of information available for this ecosystem. In this context, additional research congregating a potential linkage between physiological activities sustaining the regular metabolism of earthworms and their avoidance behaviour or even their reproductive effects would be welcomed, especially in what regards formulated pesticides. Such approach would provide a robust and comprehensive understanding of chemical effects. Furthermore, it is encouraged that natural soils should be used to improve the reliability of chemical testing.",2009,9,137,147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-009-0058-0

This study investigated the impact of parental and direct exposure to 1 mu gL-1 of glyphosate using the AS alone or one of two GBH formulations (i.e. Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Jardin (R)) in the early developmental stages of rainbow trout. Three different modes of exposure on the F1 generation were studied: (1) intergenerational (i.e. fish only exposed through their parents); (2) direct (i.e. fish exposed only directly) and (3) multigenerational (i.e. fish both exposed intergenerationally and directly). The impact of chemical treatments on embryo-larval development (survival, biometry and malformations), swimming behaviour, biochemical markers of oxidative stress equilibrium (TBARS and catalase), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and energy metabolism (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome-c oxidase, CCO; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH) was explored. Chemical exposure did not affect the survival of F1 embryos or malformation rates. Direct exposure to the AS induced some biometric changes, such as reduction in head size (with a 10% decrease in head length), independently of coformulants. Intergenerational exposure to the AS or the Roundup GBH increased swimming activity of the larvae, with increase of between 78 and 102% in travel speeds. Viaglif co-formulants appear to have counteracted this behavioural change. The minor changes detected in the assayed biochemical markers suggested that observed effects were not due to oxidative damage, AChE inhibition or alterations to energy metabolism. Nonetheless, multi- and intergenerational exposure to Roundup increased CS:CCO and LDH:CS ratios by 46% and 9%, respectively, with a potential modification of the aerobic-to-anaerobic energy production balance. These biochemical effects were not correlated with those observed on individual level of biological organization. Therefore, further studies on generational toxicity of glyphosate and its co-formulants are needed to identify the other mechanisms of glyphosate toxicity at the cellular level.",2021,237,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105894

Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 vgL 1, turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 vgL 1, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, a seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg The impact of AsiMax 50 seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance a higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment",2019,5,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02221

The commercial formulation of benzofenap and a blank formulation containing only the adjuvants of Taipan(R) 300 were tested against final instar larvae of the midge Chironornus tepperi and adults of the aquatic snail Isidorella newcombi. In 24-h acute bioassays the midge larvae did not show significant mortality at a nominal concentration of 1.2 mg/L active ingredient (AI), double the maximum notional concentration expected in rice fields after application of Taipan(R) 300 at the permit rate of 2 L/ha. No significant snail mortality was recorded in acute bioassays (24-h exposure, 48-h recovery) at nominal concentrations up to 76 mg/L AI, which is over 120 times the maximum notional field concentration. In chronic assays, the pupation and emergence of C. tepperi was monitored after a 4-h pulse exposure of final instar larvae to Taipan(R) 300 (nominal concentrations 0.001 to 0.1 mg/L AI) and adjuvant-only (0.1 mg/L equivalent) treatments. No statistically significant effects were observed, although emergence appeared to be delayed by higher benzofenap concentrations and by the adjuvant-only treatment. During Snail bioassays, egg and feces production were monitored for 21 days after 24-h exposure to Taipan(R) 300 (nominal concentrations 1.2 mg/L to 60 mg/L AI) and adjuvant-only treatments (60 mg/L equivalent). No significant chronic effects were proven against I. newcombi, despite a decline in egg mass production following exposure to all treatments and a reduction in the total numbers of eggs produced at the highest nominal concentrations tested (60 mg/L AI and adjuvant-only treatments). Similarly, feces production by snail pairs exposed to the majority of treatments declined, but these differences were not statistically significant.

332,Cecylia,not vetted,"Bencko, V; Foong, FYL",The history of arsenical pesticides and health risks related to the use of Agent Blue,ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE,"Arsenicals in agriculture. Beginning in the 1970s, the use of arsenic compounds for such purposes as wood preservatives, began to grow. By 1980, in the USA, 70% of arsenic had been consumed for the production of wood preservatives. This practice was later stopped, due to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ban of the arsenic-and chromium-based wood preservative chromated copper arsenate. In the past, arsenical herbicides containing cacodylic acid as an active ingredient have been used extensively in the USA, from golf courses to cotton fields, and drying-out the plants before harvesting. The original commercial form of Agent Blue was among 10 toxic insecticides, fungicides and herbicides partially deregulated by the US EPA in February 2004, and specific limits on toxic residues in meat, milk, poultry and eggs, were removed. Today, however, they are no longer used as weed-killers, with one exception - monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA), a broadleaf weed herbicide for use on cotton. Severe poisonings from cacodylic acid caused headache, dizziness, vomiting, profuse and watery diarrhea, followed by dehydration, gradual fall in blood pressure, stupor, convulsions, general paralysis and possible risk of death within 3-14 days. The relatively frequent use of arsenic and its compounds in both industry and agriculture points to a wide spectrum of opportunities for human exposure. This exposure can be via inhalation of airborne arsenic, contaminated drinking water, beverages, or from food and drugs. Today, acute organic arsenical poisonings are mostly accidental. Considerable concern has developed surrounding its delayed effects, for its genotoxic and carcinogenic potential, which has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies and subsequent animal experiments. Conclusions. There is substantial epidemiological evidence for an excessive risk, mostly for skin and lung cancer, among humans exposed to organic arsenicals in occupational and environmental settings. Furthermore, the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects have only been observed at relatively high exposure rates. Current epidemiological and experimental studies are attempting to elucidate the mechanism of this action, pointing to the question whether arsenic is actually a true genotoxic, or rather an epigenetic carcinogen. Due to the complexity of its effects, both options remain plausible. Its interactions with other toxic substances still represent another important field of interest.",2017,24,312,316,http://dx.doi.org/10.26444/aaem/74715

A few comprehensive studies on the management of FRD under field conditions have examined various treatment combinations for disease control and yield response analysis. This study aimed to compare the control efficiencies and yield responses of treatments applied over multiple locations and compute the probable returns of investment (ROIs) for treatment costs. Data were gathered from 21 field trials conducted across five main arecanut growing regions of India in the period 2012-2019. The collected data were subjected to analysis with a multivariate (network) meta-analytical model, following standard statistical protocols. The quantitative, synthesized data were evaluated for the estimated effects of disease pressure (DPLow <= 35% of FRDInc in the treatments > DPHigh), mean disease control efficiencies (treatment mean, C), and yield responses (R) corresponding to the tested treatments. Based on disease control efficacy, the evaluated treatments were grouped into three efficacy groups (EGs): higher EGs were observed for the Bordeaux mixture (C, 81.94%) and its stabilized formulation (C, 74.99%), Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (C, 70.66%), while lower EGs were observed in plots treated with Biofight (C, 29.91%), Biopot (C, 25.66%), and Suraksha (C, 29.74%) and intermediate EGs were observed in plots to which microbial consortia (bio-agents) had been applied. Disease pressure acted as a significant moderator variable, influencing yield response and gain. At DPLow, the Bordeaux fungicide mixture (102%, 22% of increased yield) and Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (77.5%, +15.5%) exhibited higher yield responses, with absolute arecanut yield gains of 916.5 kg ha(-1) and 884 kg ha(-1), while, under DPHigh, Fosetyl-AL (819.6 kg ha(-1)) showed a yield response of 90.5%.

The combination of ATZ with macromolecular systems, such as cyclodextrins (CDs), can improve its usefulness and herbicide efficacy related to the controlled release of the active ingredient. In this study, inclusion complexes of ATZ in CD and hybrid cyclodextrin-silica materials (CDSI) were prepared and characterized. Infrared spectral analysis of the inclusion compounds, concomitant with the suppression of the endothermic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) peaks related to the fusion temperature of ATZ, confirmed the inclusion of ATZ in the functionalized and non-functionalized oligosaccharides. The linear increase in ATZ solubilization with the increasing addition of CD indicated that the inclusion stoichiometry was 1:1 in all studied systems. The increase in solubilization of the herbicide was approximately 1.3 times for alpha-CD and gamma-CD, which had association constants of 20.3 and 13.4 L mol-1, respectively. The increase in solubility for alpha-CDSI and gamma-CDSI was 3.3 and 2.7-fold, and the association constants were 161.1 and 111.1 L mol-1, respectively. Molecular mechanics (MM) calculations were performed using the force fields MM3* and AMBER*, and the results indicated that the most stable conformations resulted from the penetration of ATZ through the narrower cavity of the CDs. The MD calculations indicated three possible orientations for ATZ in the alpha-CD cavity, while for gamma-CD the amplitude of the standard deviation of the energy values made it impossible to select a more favorable orientation. The ATZ release profile was affected by complexation. Over 22 h, more than 50% of noncomplexed ATZ was released, while for the complexes, less than 20% was released. The complexation, as well as the commercial formulation, provided variations in the devel-opment of Brassica juncea seedlings for the layers with higher concentrations of ATZ, thus agreeing with soil layer mobility studies indicated that complexation did not increase the leaching capacity of ATZ, which was mainly distributed in the upper soil layers, where it may be more available for herbicide control functions.",2023,656,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.130470

The hundreds of GBHs used worldwide consist of the active ingredient (AI) glyphosate in form of different salts, possibly other AIs, and various mostly undisclosed co-formulants. Pesticide risk assessments are commonly performed using single AIs or GBHs at standard soil conditions without vegetation. In a greenhouse experiment, we established a weed population with common amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus) to examine the effects of three GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Roundup PowerFlex, Touchdown Quattro) and their corresponding AIs (salts of glyphosate isopropylammonium, potassium, diammonium) on the activity and physiological biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase, GST; acetylcholine esterase, AChE) of an ecologically relevant earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris). GBHs and AIs were applied at recommended doses; hand weeding served as control. Experiments were established with two soil types differing in organic matter content (SOM; 3.0% vs. 4.1%) and other properties. Results Earthworm activity (casting and movement activity) decreased after application of glyphosate formulations or active ingredients compared to hand weeding. We found no consistent pattern that formulations had either higher or lower effects on earthworm activity than their active ingredients; rather, differences were substance-specific. Earthworm activity was little affected by soil organic matter levels. Biomarkers remained unaffected by weed control types; GST but not AChE was decreased under high SOM. Water infiltration after a simulated heavy rainfall was interactively affected by weed control types and SOM. Leachate amount was higher after application of formulations than active ingredients and was higher under low SOM. Glyphosate concentrations in soil and leachate were strongly affected by application of formulations or active ingredients and varied with SOM (significant weed control type x SOM interaction). Conclusions We found that both commercial formulations and pure active ingredients can influence earthworms with consequences on important soil functions. Glyphosate products showed increased, reduced or similar effects than pure glyphosate on particular soil functions; soil properties can substantially alter this. Especially at lower SOM, heavy rainfalls could lead to more glyphosate leaching into water bodies. A full disclosure of co-formulants would be necessary to further decipher their specific contributions to these inconsistent effects.",2021,33,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00492-0

Whereas the suite of pesticides used for mosquito control changed in subsequent years, a field study was also conducted to determine pesticide concentrations in surface waters on Long Island and in LIS after operational applications. The commercial formulations used in 2002 and 2003-Scourge, Anvil and Altosid-contain the active ingredients resmethrin, sumithrin and methoprene, respectively. Concentrations of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) were also measured as a proxy for pesticide exposure. Acute mortality ill Stage I-II larval lobsters demonstrated that they are extremely sensitive to continuous resmethrin exposure.

Methods In the current study, four pyrethroid insecticides include alpha-cypermethrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and permethrin were incorporated into stable nanoemulsions. The optimization of nanoemulsions is designed based on the active ingredient, solvent, surfactant, sonication time, sonication cycle, and sonication energy by factorial analysis. The nanoscale emulsions' droplet size and morphology were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The toxicity of nanoemulsions against Culex pipiens larvae was evaluated and compared with the technical and commercial formulations. The in vitro assay of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), carboxylesterase (CaE), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were also investigated. Furthermore, molecular docking was examined to assess the binding interactions between the tested pyrethroids and the target enzymes. Also, an ecotoxicological assessment of potential effects of the tested products on the freshwater alga Raphidocelis subcapitata was determined according to OECD and EPA methods. The emulsifible concentration (EC50) and NOEC (no observed effect concentration) values were estimated for each insecticide and graded according to the GHS to determine the risk profile in aquatic life. Results The mean droplet diameter and zeta potential of the prepared pyrethroid nanoemulsions were found to be in the range of 72.00-172.00 nm and - 0.539 to - 15.40 mV, respectively. All insecticides' nanoemulsions showed significantly high toxicity (1.5-2-fold) against C. pipiens larvae compared to the technical and EC. The biochemical activity data proved that all products significantly inhibited ATPase. However, GST and CaE were significantly activated.

It is extensively used in the agriculture and veterinary medicine for controlling a wide variety of pests. Though FIP showed lower toxicity in vertebrates than in insects, it was recognized to have a variety of toxic effects in mammals. The present study was undertaken to evaluate FIP-induced alterations in the blood biochemical markers and oxidative stress parameters in male albino mice via oral sub-acute toxicity exposure. The possible ameliorative effect of the pretreatment with selenium plus alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) against the harmful effects of FIP was also investigated. Mice in FIP-test groups were exposed to different sublethal doses, i.e., 1.43, 2.87, and 4.78 mg active ingredient (AI)/kg body weight (b.w.), equal to 1/100, 1/50, and 1/30 LD50 of FIP, respectively, for 28 days. Mice in the amelioration groups were orally administered with selenium + vitamin E (0.3 mg + 22.5 mg/kg b.w., respectively) 14 days prior to exposure to the higher dose (4.78 mg/kg) of FIP for another 14 days. Fipronil exposure at medium and high doses showed lowered values of red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet (PLT) counts after 28-day exposure, compared to the control. All three doses caused significant increases in levels of liver-function biomarkers, i.e., aspartate amino transaminase (AST), alanine amino transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cholesterol, and bilirubin levels compared to the control. Levels of biomarkers related to kidney functions, i.e., urea, uric acid, and creatinine, increased significantly than these of the control. Likewise, the oxidative stress indices, i.e., hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA), significantly increased at the higher and medium doses, while antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), decreased significantly. On the other hand, prior administration of selenium + vitamin E in the FIP-exposed mice led to restore values of most hematological parameters nearly to these of the control. Also, the levels of AST, total protein, and creatinine seemed to be restored to the control values. Interestingly, pretreatment with selenium + vitamin E restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes, CAT and SOD, to the control values, whereas, oxidative stress indices, H2O2 and MDA, remained significantly high. It is our thought that the sublethal dose less than 1.43 mg/kg b.w. of commercial formulation of FIP (COACH (R) 200 SC) could be considered as no-observed-adverse-effect-level(NOAEL) under our present experimental conditions at short-term toxicity study.

In this work we introduce nanostructures such as chitosan-poly-epsilon-caprolactone (CS_PCL) nanoparticles to encapsulate amitraz (CS_PCLnp_Amitraz) and fluazuron (CS_PCLnp_Fluazuron) to treat tick infestations more effectively. The CS_PCLnp_Amitraz system has a final amitraz concentration of 1.0 mg/mL with a particle size of 275 +/- 30 nm, surface charge of +43 +/- 7 mV and entrapment efficiency of 77 +/- 1%. The CS_PCLnp_Fluazuron system has a drug concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with a particle size of 295 +/- 35 nm, surface charge of +45 +/- 10 mV and entrapment efficiency of 89 +/- 1%. Both systems reduced cytotoxicity on Balb/c 3T3 culture cells and were also active against R. microplus. Both molecules-amitraz and fluazuron - formed molecularly dispersed active compounds inside the core of the PCL polymer matrix. The PCL surface was composed of a chitosan layer, which influenced the stability of the steric nanoparticles at pH greater than 7. Both systems were stable at a saline concentration of 1.25 mol/L and at temperatures below 50 degrees C. Experiments conducted in vivo with CS_PCLnp_Amitraz, at doses of active ingredient equivalent to those of commercial products, showed decreased tick infestation for 21 days, as well as higher acaricide effect than observed for commercial products, which recommend a reapplication in 14 days. The acaricide effect was even stronger when CS_PCLnp_Amitraz (same dose as for commercial products) and CS_PCLnp_Fluazuron (half of the amount for commercial products) were administered together.",2022,13,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.101849

During in vitro tests, isolated 2-cell stage mice embryos were cultured in media with various concentrations of active compounds or commercial products until blastocyst formation. As found using stereomicroscopic examination, all neonicotinoids at highest (100 04) concentration negatively affected embryonic development (P < 0.001). Fluorescence staining revealed that the blastocysts obtained displayed lower numbers of blastomeres and elevated incidence of cell death. Thiacloprid and acetamiprid decreased quality of blastocysts also at 10 mu M concentration. From the tested products only Calypso 480SC containing 10 mu M of thiacloprid showed harmful impact on embryo quality. In an experiment using rabbit embryos, similar negative effect of thiacloprid in vitro was recorded. In vivo testing confirmed that blastocysts collected from thiacloprid-treated mice displayed lower total cell counts than blastocysts from controls. The sensitivity of embryonic cells to neonicotinoids is in the order of thiacloprid > acetamiprid, thiomethoxam > clothianidin.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of the commercial products Cyperkill 25 EC (active compound 250 g/l cypermethrin) and Decis Mega (active compound 50 g/l deltamethrin) for European non-indigenous marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, spiny-cheek crayfish Orconectes limosus and yabby Cherax destructor. These data will provide a baseline for potential programmes to eradicate alien crayfish from Europe (EU Regulation No. 1143/2014; Commission Implementing Regulation No. 2016/1141) and are also relevant globally. The 96hLC(50) values of Cyperkill 25 EC were 0.09, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19 and 0.30 mu g/l for spiny-cheek crayfish, red swamp crayfish, marbled crayfish, signal crayfish and yabby, respectively. In the same order, the 96hLC(50) values of Decis Mega were 0.76, 0.16, 0.21, 0.03 and 0.27 mu g/l. The toxicity of the insecticides was similar and species-specific, possibly reflecting the size difference of the tested animals. This study shows that cypermethrin and deltamethrin are highly toxic to the tested crayfish species at low concentrations. This high sensitivity, along with the low accumulation in the food chain and short-term persistence in the aquatic environment, suggests that they are suitable biocides for eradicating crayfish in the wild. Stagnant, closed water bodies with newly emerging invaders are ideal sites for possible application, although local conditions must be considered.",2019,64,125,133,http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/136/2018-VETMED

Pesticide residues were identified as problem formulation in the respective European regulations and in this context, the European Food and Safety Authority has suggested to group pesticidal active ingredients (AIs) into cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) based on the toxicological properties of each AI. One proposed CAG, on the liver, currently consists of 15 subgroups, each representing a specific hepatotoxic effect observed in toxicity studies. Dietary cumulative risk assessments would then have to be conducted assuming dose additivity of all members of each CAG subgroup. The purpose of this publication is to group AIs based upon the knowledge of the pathogenesis of liver effects to discriminate between primary end points (direct consequence of chemical interaction with a biological target) and secondary end points (which are a consequence of, or that arise out of, a previous pathological change). Focusing on the relevant primary end points strengthens and simplifies the selection of compounds for cumulative risk assessment regarding the liver and better rationalizes the basis for chemical grouping. Relevant dose additivity is to be expected at the level of the primary/leading pathological end points and not at the level of the secondary end points. We recognize, however, that special consideration is needed for substances provoking neoplasia, and this category is included in the group of primary end points for which chemicals inducing them are grouped for risk assessment. Using the pathological basis for defining the respective CAGs, 6 liver subgroups and 2 gallbladder/bile duct groups are proposed. This approach simplifies the cumulative assessment calculation without obviously affecting consumer safety.",2020,48,397,410,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0192623319895481

In this study, the aphidicidal effect of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) extract against mustard aphid was confirmed, the main active compounds identified, and aphidicidal mechanism of the most active compound established. RESULTS When the treatment concentration was 10.0 g L-1, the corrected mortality of bamboo leaf extract (BE) was 53.22 +/- 5.20% and the petroleum ether component of bamboo leaf extract (PE) reached 82.76 +/- 4.50%, which also showed a synergistic effect with imidacloprid. Four flavonoids were identified as the main active components in the BE via activity tracking and phytochemical method. Isoorientin had an LC50 of 313.22 mg L-1, and affected the activities of acetylcholinesterase and peroxidase significantly, revealing the possible aphidicidal mechanism. When the treatment of 11.1% PE center dot imidacloprid was 200 mL, the control effect was 99.07%, which was better than that observed with 10% of imidacloprid or 0.5% of matrine. CONCLUSIONS These data provide a better understanding of the aphidicidal activity and aphidicidal mechanism of moso bamboo leaf extract and the most active compound, isoorientin.

Its activity is based on the inhibition of mold sporulation on fruit skin, which makes it one of the most commonly used fungicide in post-harvest citrus treatments for fruit preservation during storage, shipping, and marketing. Due to its wide application, the presence of imazalil needs to be monitored to avoid the excessive and/or improper use. This work reports a complete analysis of the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra of imazalil as a pure compound as well as in the commercial product for agricultural use; the band assignment relays in the vibrational predictions acquired by quantum-chemical calculations (B3LYP/6-311+g(2df, p)) for the imazalil molecule. An analytical application of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is also presented here. It is done so by using a novel, low-cost, and sensitive SERS-active substrate built with silver nanoparticles supported on a Si/ZnO nanowires platform to detect traces of imazalil in aqueous solutions.

Since podophyllotoxin commercial production via chemical synthesis, biotechnological intervention or cultivation has yet to meet the increasing demand, mining the potentially available plant organs to discover more natural podophyllotoxin sources is essential. This study investigated the reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) fingerprint, active chemicals (lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic profiles), and bioactivities (antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities) of distinct S. hexandrum plant organs. Among different plant organs, the rhizome is a preponderant organ due to high active compounds especially podophyllotoxin at 71.615.10(3) mu g/mL, high bioactivity with low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)/minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC)/minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) value of 5/5/5 mg/ mL, and low CIR50 value of 0.0718 mu g/mL, followed by root. Chemometrics analysis techniques, including correlation analysis (CA), similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA), were further employed to facilitate accurate quality assessment of different plant organs from S. hexandrum. The findings unambiguously validated the clustering of seven samples into four major groups (G1-G4), with G1 (rhizome)>G2 (root)>G4 (fruit, blossom, and leaf)>G3 (stem and petiole) as the consistent quality ordering, despite significant differences in chemical compositions and bioactivities. Considered the practical application, the rhizome is, therefore, a preferred medicinal organ, and root could be considered as a substitute resource. The rhizome or root extraction could be used as a potential raw material source for natural antimicrobial agents and cancer cell inhibitors in the food, medicine, and healthcare industries.

However, the quality and quantity of active substances from wild collected and field grown plants is often fluctuating and heterogeneous depending on environmental conditions. Infestation, diseases and the application of pesticides additionally decrease the quality of the plant material. In vitro culture of plants can overcome these problems, since the environmental conditions that affect plant metabolism can be strictly controlled. Thus, an advanced bioreactor system is a key step towards commercial production of secondary metabolites by plant biotechnology. In Germany, research into applications of plant biotechnology has been concentrated on plant genomics and natural product synthesis, including the development of modern biopharmaceuticals. Plant cell suspension and hairy root cultures are used as natural bioactive substance factories to produce plant-derived compounds. Recombinant pharmaceutical proteins and vaccines are derived from transgenic plants. BioPlanta has developed a platform technology for the cultivation of in vitro shoot and organ culture based on the temporary immersion system. It is adaptable to the special requirements of different plant tissue cultures, such as shoots, roots and micro-tubers.

Methods Data on registered commercial products in the years 1990 and 2000 were analyzed according to toxicological class, date of registration of the active ingredient (before or after the Law) and usage class (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and others). Relative Identified Distribution Analysis was utilized for verging statistical differences between distributions according to toxicological classes. Results Among the 863 registered commercial products in 2000, 46.6% were already registered before the Pesticide Law. Among the 461 commercial products registered after the Law, 59.2% were derivatives of active ingredients registered before the Law, and 41.4% were classified as highly hazardous (classes I and II of the Brazilian toxicological classification). No significant differences in toxicological classification profile were identified between the group of pesticides derived from active ingredients registered before the Law and the group derived from active ingredients registered after the Law (p < 0.0859). Conclusions Ten years after the Pesticide Law came into effect, no significant improvement had been observed in the toxicological classification profile of registered pesticides. This was due especially to the continuing presence of products registered before the Law and the registration of new commercial products derived from old active ingredients.

Rising incidence, increased risk among migrants to higher risk regions, and poor prediction of individual risk have prompted a search for additional modifiable factors. Risk factors for breast cancer include reproductive characteristics associated with estrogen and other hormones, pharmaceutical hormones, and activities such as alcohol use and lack of exercise that affect hormone levels. As a result, investigation of hormonally active compounds in commercial products and pollution is a priority. Compounds that cause mammary tumors in animals are additional priorities. Animal models provide insight into possible mechanisms for effects of environmental pollutants on breast cancer and identify chemical exposures to target in epidemiologic studies. Although few epidemiologic studies have been conducted for chemical exposures, occupational studies show associations between breast cancer and exposure to certain organic solvents and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Population-based studies have been limited to a few organochlorine compounds and PAHs and have been mostly negative. A variety of challenges in studies of breast cancer and the environment may have contributed to negative findings. Lack of exposure assessment tools and few hypothesis-generating toxicologic studies limit the scope of epidemiologic studies. Issues of timing with respect to latency and periods of breast vulnerability, and individual differences in susceptibility pose other challenges.

We found out, that imidacloprid was not highly toxic to tested organisms in comparison to some other environmental pollutants tested in the same experimental set-up. Among the organisms tested, water flea D. magna proved to be the most sensitive species after a short-term (48 h EC50 = 56.6 mg L-1) and long-term exposure (21 d NOEC = 1.25 mg L-1). On the contrary, the intensified toxicity of Confidor SL 200 in comparison to analytical grade imidacloprid was observed in the case of algae and slight increase of its toxicity was detected testing daphnids and fish. The activities of cholinesterase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase of daphnids were not early biomarkers of exposure to imidacloprid and its commercial product.

Of all phytophagous mites known in the country, four species are found on a wide range of crops, with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and the broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), being the most important. The broad mite is difficult to control, but acaricides registered in Romania have provided effective control of this species. Reduction of highly toxic pesticide residues in the environment has been considered important in the country. That could be approached by first reducing the amount of pesticides applied on agricultural land, and second, by finding new pesticides with less toxic active ingredients. This has resulted in reduced numbers of the main groups of pesticides, commercial products and number of active substances. The number of available commercial products varied from 12 in 1972-1979 to five in 1980-1989, ten in 1990-1996, four in 1997-2004 and six in 2010, based on five active ingredients. The causes of the decreasing numbers of acaricide products or active ingredients were the reduced availability of several active ingredients due to toxicological or environmental reasons and the high registration cost. Only three acaricides (Envidor 240 SC, Nissorun 10 WP and Omite 570 EC) and one insecticide/acaricide (Seizer 10 EC) are at present commonly used in Romanian agriculture. At the same time, from the economic point of view, biological control is impractical if not impossible to be applied in commercial crop production under Romanian economical conditions of farmers in absence of subsidies.

As many chemical insecticides are banned due to environmental side effects or are of reduced efficacy due to resistance, biological control, including the use of bacterial strains with insecticidal activity, is of increasing interest and importance. The urgent actual need relies on the discovery of new compounds, preferably of a biological nature. Here, we explored the phenomenon of natural larvae mortality in larval breeding sites to identify potential novel compounds that may be used in biological control. From there, we isolated 14 bacterial strains of the phylum Firmicutes, most of the order Bacillales. Cultures were carried out under controlled conditions and were separated on supernatant and pellet fractions. The two fractions and a 1:1 mixture of the two fractions were tested on L3 and early L4Aedes albopictus. Two concentrations were tested (2 and 6 mg/L). Larvae mortality was recorded at 24, 48 and 72 h and compared to that induced by the commercializedB. thuringiensissubsp.israelensis. Of the 14 strains isolated, 11 were active against theA. albopictuslarvae: 10 of the supernatant fractions and one pellet fraction, and mortality increased with the concentration. For the insecticide activity prediction in three strains of theBacillus cereuscomplex, PCR screening of the crystal(Cry)and cytolytic(Cyt)protein families characteristic toB. thuringiensissubsp.israelensiswas performed.

The first commercial product of the neem tree, Margosan-O (W.R. Grace), was registered in the U.S. in 1985. Since then several other neem-based insecticides have been approved for use as pest controls. Pesticides, especially those interfering with animals' metabolism, in agricultural run-off water might have a detrimental effect on aquatic crustaceans, mollusks, or fish. The effect of AZA on crustaceans may be similar to the effects on insects since both are classified under the same phylum, arthropoda, and both have the same growth and molting hormones. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of neem-based pesticide (Neemix(TM)) on selected crustaceans (crayfish, blue crab, and water fleas) and a mollusk species (freshwater snails) which are important in the food chain. LC(50)s for water fleas were found to be 0.246 ppm and 0.024 ppm AZA for pure AZA and Neemix(TM), respectively. The LC50 value for Neemix(TM) was 6.60 ppm AZA for crayfish. AZA did not show significant toxicity to crayfish at the concentrations used. For freshwater snails, the LC50 for Neemix(TM) was 2.45 ppm AZA while that of pure AZA was >30 ppm. The LC50 value for blue crabs was 1.16 ppm AZA for Neemix(TM). These results showed that Neemix(TM) was more toxic than pure AZA when applied at equivalent AZA concentrations, indicating that AZA is not the only active compound in Neemix(TM).",1998,NA,1248,1253,NA

Acute effects were evaluated using different end points for lethality, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. Median lethal concentration (LC50) estimation was employed as a bioassay for lethality, whereas micronucleus (MN) induction and alterations in erythrocyte/erythroblast frequency were used as end points for genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, respectively.

The paw paw is a small tree native to eastern North America; its edible fruits (sometimes referred to as Indiana Bananas) have nurtured mankind for centuries. Activity-directed fractionation of the paw paw extracts, using the brine shrimp lethality bioassay, led to the isolation and molecular characterization of over 50 unique annonaceous acetogenins. Fractionation of extracts from related species resulted in the identification of over 150 additional acetogenins. The annonaceous acetogenins are derivatives of long-chain (C-32 or C-34) fatty acids. They are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial (complex I) as well as cytoplasmic (anaerobic) production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the related nucleotides. The powerful cytotoxicity, in vivo antitumor, pesticidal, antimalarial, anthelmintic, piscicidal, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects indicated a myriad of potentially useful applications. Commercial development of these compounds uses natural mixtures of active components, incorporated into pesticidal, topical, and dietary supplement products. Successful applications and commercial products include a shampoo, highly effective in treating infestations of head lice, fleas, and ticks; a series of pesticidal sprays, which protects host plants against a diversity of pests; and an ointment for treatment of oral herpes (HSV-1) and other skin afflictions.

The polymeric composites were obtained by melt processing and their thermal properties evaluated. The release of active compounds was evaluated by conductometric analysis in aqueous solutions at different pHs for 30 days, and the results were modulated by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. Also, the systems were evaluated for their biodegradation characteristics using different soil types to generate a decomposition profile. In general, the systems showed a good release control, with 40% and 50% of fertilizer being released in 30 days, depending on the conditions and type of polymeric composite employed. The model indicated a linear release of active compounds in the first 30 days, according to the Fick diffusion. Additionally, the compounds were relatively stable in the first 30 days when exposed to biodegradation, being degraded faster speed after this. The efficiency and applicability of the systems were confirmed by the germination tests, which showed that both systems containing NPK favored plant growth, while the system in which the active agents had been previously incorporated into nanoparticles provided a reduction in the waste of agrochemicals.

We studied hemolysis after 1, 5, and 24 h incubation; lipid peroxidation, hemoglobin oxidation, the level of reduced glutathione, and the activity of catalase after 1 h. Human erythrocytes were incubated with 100-1500 ppm (100 mug/ml erythrocytes at 5% hematocrite) Roundup Ultra 360 SL and glyphosate. We have found that after 1 h of incubation only Roundup Ultra 360 SL increased the level of methemoglobin, products of lipid peroxidation at 500 ppm and hemolysis at 1500 ppm [Curr. Top. Biophys. 26 (2002) 245], while its active compound glyphosate increased the level of methemoglobin and the level of lipid peroxidation at much higher dose-1000 ppm. At the same time hemolysis was observed to only at the highest dose of glyphosate (1500 ppm) and the longest time of incubation (24h). Both Roundup Ultra 360 SL and glyphosate did not cause statistically significant changes in the level of GSH, but increased the activity of catalase. Roundup Ultra 360 SL provokes more changes in the function of erythrocytes than its active substance glyphosate, which is probably a result of the properties of additives. Taking into account the limited accumulation of Roundup Ultra 360 SL and glyphosate in the organism as well as the fact that the threshold doses which caused changes in erythrocytes for Roundup Ultra 360 SL were only 500 and 1000 ppm for glyphosate, one may conclude that this pesticide is safe towards human erythrocytes.

Controlled release provides a means to increase the efficiency of active components by reducing the amount required in any given application. This approach also lowers contamination effects of active compounds in the application environment through the reduced dose. So far, numerous physical and chemical techniques have been developed to encapsulate liquids or solids. Among them emulsification has been widely used as a template stage to generate discrete spherical particulates with good control of the particle size. To facilitate good size and size distribution, emulsification methods have developed from conventional approaches such as turbulent shear mixing to a drop-by-drop production using membranes and/or micro-fluidics. However, the complexity of fluid systems can provide problems especially when larger droplets are desired and/or further processing is needed. We are currently exploring the combination of an advanced emulsification technique (cross-flow membrane emulsification) with the formulation of specific interface properties to achieve droplets with a desired larger size (20-50 mu m) and narrow size distribution (from a very low viscous oil) that are suitable for use as templates in microcapsule manufacture.

Previous works showed that PYR is strongly adsorbed on soil which consequently limits its bioavailability. Although some degradation tests on soil reported in literature produced half-life times values for this compound, no information is available regarding its degradability when a commercial product is used. Given the current lack of information regarding the persistence of PYR in the soil, this work-highlights its behaviour in two soils and concentrates on how the commercial product behaved rather than the pure active ingredient. Degradation tests were also carried Out in sterile water with different pH (4, 7 and 9) and in two water samples taken from the Simeto River (Sicily, Italy). The half-life times found were lower than those reported in the literature. Degradation time was lower in the soil containing the largest amount of organic matter, thus confirming the important role played by the micro-organisms it contains in the degradation of the molecule. The commercial product behaved differently both as regards adsorption and degradation. In fact, a weak adsorption was accompanied by faster degradation.

BOTRY-Zen at 6 g/L reduced significantly the percentage of rotted fruit in comparison with the untreated control. However, its effectiveness was significantly less than that of the fungicide Switch 25/37.5 WG (fludioxonil: cyprodinil) at a rate of 1 g/L (recommended by producer). There was no significant difference between the BOTRY-Zen at rate of 4 g/L and untreated plants.

Attention to the indicated compounds is due to the broad and diverse areas of their application in technology, in agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, as biologically active agents, fragrances, additives to lubricating oils, plasticisers, stabilising and modifying agents for polymer materials, etc. Biologically active compounds - the derivatives of bisamides of dicarboxylic acids possessing antibacterial, antiviral, anticonvulsant, antitumour, analgesic, fungicide properties are used for prophylactics and treatment of cardiovascular, viral and oncological diseases. The high thermal and thermal-oxidative stability of the adamantine derivatives based on dicarboxylic acids is also of great interest. These compounds, due to their properties caused by the presence of the framework fragment, are used for the synthesis of high-molecular compounds, in the production of fuel and lubricants, or as additives to them.

These fungicidal activities were not influenced by pH values. Octyl gallate at 100 mug/ml reduced plasma membrane fluidity to 48% of control. On the other hand. dodecyl gallate at the same concentration reduced it to 76% of control, Only octyl gallate inhibited glucose-induced medium acidification, indicating direct or indirect inhibition of plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The primary fungicidal activity of octyl gallate comes from its ability to act as a nonionic surface-active agent (surfactant), though it can not be inferred that membrane damage, such as a decrease in the membrane fluidity, is the only cause of the lethal effect.

For this purpose, new pesticide formulations were designed by combining wheat gluten, ethofumesate (model pesticide) and three montmorillonites (MMT) using a bi-vis extrusion process. Controlled release properties, evaluated through release experiments in water, were discussed in relation to the material formulations and their resulting structure. Partition coefficients were calculated from experimental data and diffusivity values were identified with a Fick's second law mechanistic model. The effect of temperature on release pattern was also evaluated and the activation energy of diffusion was determined. Ethofumesate release was slowed down for all wheat gluten based-formulations as compared to the commercial product. This slow release effect was increased in the presence of hydrophobic MMTs, due to a higher affinity for ethofumesate than for wheat gluten. Contrarily, hydrophilic MMT, displaying a greater affinity for wheat gluten than for ethofumesate seemed ineffective to slow down its release despite the tortuous pathway achieved through a well-exfoliated structure. To conclude, the release mechanisms would be rather governed by pesticide/MMT interactions than MMT/polymer matrix in the case of a hydrophobic pesticide such as ethofumesate and a hydrophilic matrix such as wheat gluten.

Further, on analysing the toxicity of the soil residue after washing, it was observed that SAC from biosolids washed soil exhibited an average of 1.5-fold lesser toxicity compared to that of Triton x-100 on different test models-earthworm, a monocot, and dicot plants. The analysis of the key soil pa-rameters revealed that the commercial surfactant reduced the soil organic matter and porosity by an average of 1.3-fold compared to SAC.

The ubiquitous nature of pesticides, with frequent use in agriculture and the household, and the potential for harm that pesticides pose to non-target organisms such as wildlife, humans, and pets, demonstrate the need for rapid and effective detection and identification of these compounds. In this Study, single particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) was used to rapidly detect compounds from four classes of pesticides commonly used in agricultural and household applications. These include permethrin (pyrethroid class), malathion and dichlorvos (organophosphate class), imidacloprid (chloronicotinyl class), and carbaryl (carbamate class). Analytical standards of each compound were diluted and aerosolized using a nebulizer to create particles for analysis in the SPAMS instrument. The resultant dual-polarity time-of-flight mass spectra were then analyzed to identify the characteristic peaks of the compound in each sample. In addition, samples of commercial products containing pesticides, a commercial insecticide spray, containing permethrin, and a canine flea collar, containing carbaryl, were analyzed in their original form using SPAMS without any significant sample preparation. The characteristic mass spectral peaks of the active pesticides in these samples were identified using the mass spectra obtained earlier from the pesticide analytical standards.

We compared the acaricidal activity of acetone extracts of 13 species used traditionally to protect cattle against ticks. We also investigated if the extraction of biologically active compounds against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus ticks could be enhanced by adding a liquid soap that is locally available to smallholder farmers. Methods A total of 13 plant species selected based on reported traditional use in Zimbabwe, were dried and finely ground before extraction with water, or water plus a surfactant, or acetone. The adapted Shaw Larval Immersion Test (SLIT) method was used to determine the activity of acetone and crude water extracts with or without liquid soap against the tick larvae. The activity of four fractions of crude acetone extracts (extracted using solvents of different polarity), of the most active plant species, Maerua edulis (tuber and leaf) was also compared to identify the most active fraction. Results Aqueous plant extracts were not toxic to ticks, but the addition of 1% liquid soap as a surfactant increased mortality of the R. (B) decoloratus larvae significantly. With the Maerua edulis tuber extract, the efficacy of the 1% liquid soap was comparable to that of the amitraz based commercial synthetic acaricide. The use of acetone as an extractant, also increased the mortality of the tick larvae in all the plant species. With M. edulis (tuber and leaf), Monadenium lugardae and Kleinia sp. acetone extracts, the activity was comparable to that of the positive control (a commercially available amitraz-based synthetic acaricide). The non-polar fractions of the acetone extract of leaf and tuber of M. edulis caused up to 100% mortality. This indicates that non-polar to intermediate polarity compounds are responsible for the acaricidal activity. Conclusion Organic solvents such as acetone extracted active compounds but water did not. By adding commonly available dishwashing soap to water active compounds were extracted leading to a high acaricidal activity of the plant extracts. In some cases, it was as active as non-polar extracts and a synthetic commercial acaricide (positive control).

Amitraz, dicofol, and mixtures of amitraz + dicofol were sprayed on plants in a manner that created discontinuous, checker-board residues. Behavior and mortality of twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch, were then observed. Evaluated alone, or in mixture with dicofol, amitraz resulted in significant increases in mite locomotion and. in mixtures with dicofol, eliminated mite avoidance of dicofol residues.

Chemical weed control is far more effective and economical than other methods. The frequent use of herbicides has led to environmental and human health concerns, resulting in the banning of several herbicides and challenges for the future of important active compounds such as glyphosate. RESULTS The herbicidal activity of sustainable alternatives based on certain esters of fatty acids (FA), the action of which is unrelated to the free acid, on common weeds is assessed and reported. The 13 derivatives of FA showed better physicochemical properties than pelargonic acid-based herbicides. All the reported compounds have phytotoxic activity, the highest efficacy being displayed by the methyl end-capped polyethylene glycol (mPEG) ester of pelargonic acid having 6EO (ethylene oxide). This mPEG ester showed equal or better phytotoxicity than the pelargonic acid benchmark at reduced application rate and spray volume. The active compound is a liquid at ambient temperatures, has no bad smell and is not volatile, in contrast to pelargonic acid. Notably, this active compound can be the final product, can be sprayed without adjuvants and is relatively easy to co-formulate. CONCLUSION A new lead substance is presented that is a sustainable alternative to current contact herbicides. In particular, it has potential application on railways, in precision agriculture and as a harvest aid. Its good performance and technical properties suggest this mPEG ester group may also overcome the volatility-related problems of other organic acids such as auxins.",2021,77,4648,4657,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6505

Nearly four decades later, the book Our Stolen Future by Theo Colborn et al., and other pertinent publications have revisited and broadened the issue regarding a variety of possible chemicals and the area exposed. Translation and publication became available in Japan within the last four years. Since then, Japan joined the member countries involved in the global issue of endocrine disruptors, the environmental hormone. Although a significant number of chemicals possessing a hormone-like action have been recognized for many years, and the action of their biological plausibility related to the receptor-mediated effects strongly suggests possible human effects comparable to hormonal changes in wildlife, little is known about evidences or adversities in experimental animals and humans. The most essential key to resolving these dilemmas may be to understand the mechanism of actions (i.e., a possible low-dose issue). In other words, the mechanism at the low-dose effect may be resolved simultaneously by the mechanism of three major questions linked to the low-dose issue; namely, threshold, possible oscillation, and additive and/or synergistic action.",2003,75,2555,2561,http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac200375112555

Downy mildew caused by Plasmopara viticola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Berl. & de Toni is one of the most important diseases in the vineyard. To fight this pathogen, winegrowers often rely on conventional chemical fungicides or copper-based formulations, whose use is determined to be reduced by the European Commission due to their environmental consequences. Hence, alternative plant protection products (PPP) in grapevine must be considered and studied. In this context, we selected several alternative commercial products, based on basic substances (BS) or low-risk active substances (LRAS), to evaluate their suitability to deal with P. viticola. We measured the preventive activity of the products, both in vitro and in planta, as well as their toxicity against the sporangia and zoospores of the pathogen. Results showed that four commercial products were effective against the pathogen directly and preventively, being composed of approved basic substances, more concretely, chitosan, Equisetum arvense, lecithins, and Salix cortex.

One such adjuvant is an ethoxylated soybean oil (ESBO). As the chemical composition of ESBO and the fractions mainly responsible for the adjuvant-effect are unknown, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the composition of ESBO applying preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep. HPLC) and to evaluate the adjuvant-effect of isolated fractions in comparison to the commercial product. By prep. HPLC, four main fractions could be determined and isolated. Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) and Zea mays (maize) were used as test species to evaluate the adjuvant effect of isolated fractions or ESBO on the herbicidal efficacy of bromoxynil octanoate, foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron, and technical grade bromoxynil potassium. Experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions and dry weight of leaves, leaf area, and quantum yield of photosystem II were evaluated as response parameters. Leaf area and dry weight responses showed that there was a tendency towards late eluting (non-polar) fractions enhancing the efficacy of hydrophilic herbicides to a higher extent than earlier eluting (polar) fractions. For example, foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron in combination with the most non-polar fraction resulted in a 61% lower dry weight of velvetleaf compared with the herbicide treatment without adjuvant. The analysis of quantum yield resulted in the lowest values for the treatment with bromoxynil octanoate (BO) mixed with ESBO and foramsulfuron & iodosulfuron (FI) combined with the most polar fraction, respectively.

The introduction of halogens into active ingredients has become an important concept in the quest for a modern agrochemical with optimal efficacy, environmental safety, user friendliness and economic viability. Outstanding progress has been made, especially in synthetic methods for particular halogen-substituted key intermediates that were previously prohibitively expensive. Interestingly, there has been a rise in the number of commercial products containing 'mixed' halogens, e.g. one or more fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms in addition to one or more further halogen atoms. Extrapolation of the current trend indicates that a definite growth is to be expected in fluorine-substituted agrochemicals throughout the twenty-first century. A number of these recently developed agrochemical candidates containing halogen substituents represent novel classes of chemical compounds with new modes of action. However, the complex structure-activity relationships associated with biologically active molecules mean that the introduction of halogens can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the efficacy of a compound, depending on its changed mode of action, physicochemical properties, target interaction or metabolic susceptibility and transformation. In spite of modern design concepts, it is still difficult to predict the sites in a molecule at which halogen substitution will result in optimal desired effects. This review describes comprehensively the successful utilisation of halogens and their unique role in the design of modern agrochemicals, exemplified by various commercial products from Bayer CropScience coming from different agrochemical areas.

An ion-pairing HPLC method is used for the determination as it permits the baseline separation of these highly polar herbicides and their main metabolites. The use of a highly cross-linked polystyrene-divinylbenzene sorbent (PS-DVB) gives the best results for the analysis of these compounds. This sorbent allows the direct preconcentration of the analytes at the high pH values obtained after quantitative alkaline extraction of the herbicides from soil samples. Different parameters are evaluated for the SPE preconcentration step. The high polarity of the main analytes of interest (2,4-D and MCPA) makes it necessary to work at low flow rates (<= 0.5 mL min(-1)) in order for these compounds to be retained by the PS-DVB sorbent. A two stage desorption from the SPE sorbent is required to obtain the analytes in solvents that are appropriate for HPLC determination. A first desorption with a 50:50 methanol:water mixture elutes the most polar analytes (2,4-D, MCPA and 2CP). The second elution step with methanol permits the analysis of the other phenol derivatives. The humic and fulvic substances present in the soil are not efficiently retained by PS-DVB sorbents at alkaline pH's and so do not interfere in the analysis. This method has been successfully applied in the analysis of soil samples from a golf course treated with a commercial product containing esters of 2,4-D and MCPA as the active components.

The innovative molecule belongs to the phenlypyrazolin chemistry and is being developed for global use in cereal crops. Pinoxaden is applied post-emergence at use rates of 30-60 g ai/ha and active against a wide range of important grass weed species (Alopecurus myosuroides, Apera spica-venti, Avena spp., Lolium spp., Phalaris spp. and Setaria spp.). Tolerance in key cereal crops - including both wheat and barley - is obtained by incorporating the proprietary safener cloquintocet-mexyl into an easy-to-use liquid formulation, which delivers maximal performance when used with a specially optimized adjuvant. Due to its high level of activity against most important grass weeds, its tolerance in wheat and barley crops combined with a wide application window from early to late post-emergence and rotational freedom to following crops, pinoxaden will set a new standard in grass weed control in cereals. Starting from 2006, pinoxaden will be introduced as AXIAL (R) into cereal markets globally.",2006,NA,989,995,NA

FAW control is still mostly achieved by using synthetic chemicals and genetically modified plants, which can cause adverse effects on nontarget organisms. In this sense, secondary metabolites are an inexhaustible source of bioactive substances. Thus, this study investigated the insecticidal activity of essential oils (EOs) of plants of the Lamiaceae family against FAW. The EOs from Hyptis marrubioides (LD50 = 18.49 mu g/larvae) and Ocimum basilicum (LD50 = 38.21 mu g/larvae) were toxic to FAW in topical bioassays.

Pesticides are biologically active compounds having effects on various cellula targets and their combinations lead to a broad spectrum of responses: addition, synergy, antagonism and potentiation. When combined, pesticides can interact at different levels on specific targets linked to their chemical class (mechanism of toxicity) and/or on toxicokinetic level. In addition, the cocktail effect can be derived from an interaction network involving different cellular targets.

Despite their name, inert ingredients may be biologically or chemically active and are labeled inert only because of their function in the formulated product. Most of the tests required to register a pesticide are performed with the active ingredient alone, not the fall pesticide formulation. Inert ingredients are generally not identified on product labels and are often claimed to be confidential business information. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary, we describe the shortcomings of the current procedures for assessing the hazards of pesticide formulations and demonstrate that inert ingredients can increase the toxicity of and potential exposure to pesticide formulations. DISCUSSION: Inert ingredients can increase the ability of pesticide formulations to affect significant toxicologic end points, including developmental neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, and disruption of hormone function. They can also increase exposure by increasing dermal absorption, decreasing the efficacy of protective clothing, and increasing environmental mobility and persistence. Inert ingredients can increase the phytotoxicity of pesticide formulations as well as the toxicity to Fish, amphibians, and microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: Pesticide registration should require fall assessment of formulations. Evaluations of pesticides under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and similar statutes should include impact assessment of formulations. Environmental monitoring for pesticides should include inert ingredients.

The complete solubility in water and the preservation of the biological properties of these two complexes could allow further studies to develop a novel natural herbicide for parasitic plant management based on these formulations.",2019,17,2508,2515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ob03156h

In the US alone, over 800 pesticide active ingredients are formulated in about 21000 different commercial products. Although many public health benefits have been realized by the use of pesticides, their potential impact on the environment and public health is substantial. For risk assessment studies, exposure assessment is an integral component, which has unfortunately, often been weak or missing. In the past several decades, researchers have proposed to fill these missing data gaps using biological monitoring of specific markers related to exposures. In this paper, we present a review of existing analytical methodology for the biological monitoring of exposure to pesticides. We also present a critical assessment of the existing methodology and explore areas in which more research is needed.

To assess the distribution and fate of one of these pesticides (coumaphos), two experimental hives were treated with Perizin ( the commercial product containing the active ingredient coumaphos). Samples of honey, wax, pollen, adult bees and larvae taken before treatment and up to 104 days afterwards, showed diffuse contamination. Wood hedges and wax bridges, where the pesticide solution was applied, were analysed as well. A mass balance was calculated, yielding a recovered amount of around 60% just after treatment and 38% 1 month later. Directly contaminated surfaces and wax contained the highest amount of residues. Wax and honey contained different amounts ( 10, and 0.1% respectively) but both retained residues for long time. Bees ingest most of the product just after treatment, then rapidly eliminate it by metabolism, advection and deposition processes. On the basis of analytical results, a simple model ( level I of the fugacity model) was applied to the hive system for different pesticides ( coumaphos, malathion,. uvalinate and bromopropylate).

The molecular and biological characterization of a Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. aizawai strain, named HU4-2, revealed its potential as a bioinsecticide. The strain was found to contain eight different cry genes: cry1Ab, cry1Ad, cry1C, cry1D, cry1F, cry2, cry9Ea1, and a novel cry1I-type gene. Purified parasporal crystals from strain HU4-2 comprised three major proteins of 130-145 kDa, which were tested for their insecticidal potency to four species of Lepidoptera (Helicoverpa armigera, Spodoptera exigua, S. littoralis, and S. frugiperda) and three species of mosquito (Culex pipiens pipiens, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi). The crystal proteins were highly toxic against all the species of Lepidoptera tested, moderately toxic against two of the mosquito species (C. pipiens and Ae. aegypti), but no toxicity was observed against a third species of mosquito (An. stephensi) at the concentrations used in our study. The LC50 values of the HU4-2 Bt strain against H. armigera larvae (5.11 mug/ml) was similar to that of HD-1 Bt strain (2.35 mug/ml), the active ingredient of the commercial product Dipel(R).

The mechanisms of action related to its exposure, relevant both in animals and humans, are still insufficiently investigated. This comprehensive study focused on the outcomes of terbuthylazine exposure at cell level in vitro, and a mice model in vivo. Experiments in vitro were conducted on whole human peripheral blood, isolated lymphocytes, and HepG2 cells exposed for 4 h to terbuthylazine at 8.00, 0.80, and 0.58 ng/mL, which is comparable with current reference values set by the European Commission in 2011. Terbuthylazine cytotoxicity was evaluated using dual fluorescent staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange on lymphocytes, and CCK-8 colorimetric assay on HepG2 cells. The levels of DNA damage were measured using alkaline and hOGG1-modified comet assays. The potency of terbuthlyazine regarding induction of oxidative stress in vitro was studied using a battery of standard oxidative stress biomarkers. The in vivo experiment was conducted on Swiss albino mice exposed to terbuthlyazine in the form of an active substance and its formulated commercial product Radazin TZ-50 at a daily dose of 0.0035 mg/kg bw for 14 days. Following exposure, the DNA damage levels in leukocytes, bone marrow, liver, and kidney cells of the treated mice were measured using an alkaline comet assay. In vitro results suggested low terbuthylazine cytotoxicity in non-target cells. The highest tested concentration (8.00 ng/mL) reduced lymphocyte viability by 15%, mostly due to apoptosis, while cytotoxic effects in HepG2 cells at the same concentration were negligible. Acute in vitro exposure of human lymphocytes and HepG2 cells to terbuthylazine resulted in low-level DNA instability, as detected by the alkaline comet assay. Further characterization of the mechanisms behind the DNA damage obtained using the hOGG1-modified comet assay indicated that oxidative DNA damage did not prevail in the overall damage. This was further confirmed by the measured levels of oxidative stress markers, which were mostly comparable to control. Results obtained in mice indicate that both the active substance and formulated commercial product of terbuthylazine produced DNA instability in all of the studied cell types. We found that DNA in liver and kidney cells was more prone to direct toxic effects of the parent compound and its metabolites than DNA in leukocytes and bone marrow cells. The overall findings suggest the formation of reactive terbuthylazine metabolites capable of inducing DNA cross-links, which hinder DNA migration. These effects were most pronounced in liver cells in vivo and HepG2 cells in vitro. To provide a more accurate explanation of the observed effects, additional research is needed. Nevertheless, the present study provides evidence that terbuthylazine at concentrations comparable with current reference values possesses toxicological risk because it caused low-level DNA instability, both at cellular and animal organism level, which should be further established in forthcoming studies.",2018,25,19065,19081,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2046-7

Ocotea quixos is an indigenous plant of the Ecuadorian Amazon that has fungicidal properties. In this work, we focus on developing an emulsifiable concentrate that is physically stable for use in the agricultural industry. The study aimed to determine the appropriate formulation to prepare an emulsifiable concentrate with thermodynamic stability. For the formulation, we used Ocotea quixos essential oil with cinnamaldehyde as an active ingredient, with solvesso 100 as the solvent, two non-ionic emulsifiers (Span-20 and Tween-20), and calcium phenyl sulfonate as an anionic emulsifier to obtain a stable product.

Techniques used were ac voltammetry to measure the capacitance of the layers and cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry to study Tl electrochemistry. The CV results tend to support the proposed model that nonlinear diffusion effects are not significant in the electrochemistry of Tl within the time scale of the experiment. As a result the electrode process is treated as a CE mechanism where the rate limiting step is the translocation of the ion in the channel. Complications arise because there is competition between the electroactive ion, Tl+, and the univalent electrolyte ion to enter the channel under the influence of the applied potential field. Values of the permeability rate constants have been derived from the electrochemical data. Results indicate that many hydrophobic additives in the lipid layer in particular polyaromatic and polyconjugated compounds selectively give rise to an alteration in the permeability of gramicidin-modified DOPC monolayers to Tl+. Up to 5-fold increase in gramicidin-mediated permeability is noted in monolayers with added retinol, which is similar to that seen in the presence of a similar concentration of negatively charged lipids (PS) in the layer. The chlorine-substituted aromatic pesticide DDT causes an apparent depression in the permeability. It is proposed that the variations of permeability to Tl+ due to additives in the layer are predominantly caused by the effect of the compounds within the monolayer on the energy barrier to the translocation of the ion within the channel. This occurs because the compounds alter the image forces acting on the ion passing through the channel as well as directly interacting with the ion itself.",1996,12,2058,2067,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la9507850

In vitro experiments showed that every fungicide tested at 10(3) mg l(-1) active ingredient was effective in reducing mycelial growth of Diplodia corticola. An initial field experiment showed that cork oak trunks sprayed with Thiophanate-methyl, Carbendazim, Difenoconazole, Pyraclostrobin or Copper-Calcium Sulphate under low-humidity environmental conditions exhibited significant decreases in the number and length of trunk lesions, 3 years post-treatment, compared with untreated trees. A second field experiment conducted under extremely wet conditions showed that only Thio-phanate-methyl was effective, 2.5 years after treatments, when sprayed just after peeling. Finally, in a third field experiment, under wet conditions, the preventive effectiveness of Thiophanate-methyl, Copper-Calcium Sulphate and a mix of both fungicides was confirmed, although no synergistic effect of the mixture was measured.

In vitro, all three insecticides induced a significant increase in micronucleated binucleate cells, which was generally both dose and sample time dependent. The in vivo studies involved treating male BALB/c mice by different routes, either once or on 3 consecutive days, followed by multiple or single sampling. Treatment by intraperitoneal injection or oral gavage induced a significant increase in micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs) in peripheral blood. For all three chemicals, the MN response depended on sample time and the number of treatments, while For aldicarb, the response depended also on the route of exposure. These positive results demonstrate that propoxur, methomyl, and aldicarb are capable of inducing structural and/or numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells either in vitro or in vivo. Furthermore, based on the results obtained, an optimal in vivo MN protocol for carbamate insecticides is a single treatment Followed by blood sampling at 24 and 48 hr after treatment.

Four nominal exposure conditions were tested: i) control (C), ii) AS at 500 ng L-1 (P500), iii) AS at 800 ng L-1 (P800) and iv) Prowl 400 (R) at 500 ng L-1 (Pw). After a 28 day exposure period (D28), 10 fish were sampled for each condition and 10 other after a 15 day recovery period in clean fresh water (043). Pendimethalin concentrations in the exposure water and muscles were followed. White blood cell counts, differential leucocyte counts, cell mortality and phagocytosis activity were measured. Haemolytic alternative complement activity, lysozyme concentration and stress parameters were analyzed. The resulting concentration of pendimethalin in the exposure water was lower than the expected concentration. At D28, the concentration quantified in the contaminated fish was negligible in comparison with the Reference Dose for Oral Exposure estimated by US-EPA's Integrated Risk Information System. Leucopenia was noted in all contaminated fish. A decrease in phagocytosis activity and ACH(50) was also observed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. Disturbed lysozyme activity was noted only in fish exposed to Pw. Furthermore, during exposure to a similar concentration of pendimethalin, the commercial product seemed to be more immunotoxic than the AS alone. Finally, at D43, the effects proved reversible for sanitary status while immunity was still disturbed in contaminated fish by P800 and Pw. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Since the large number of contaminants makes it impossible to perform ecotoxicity tests for each potential mixture, a robust approach for prospective environmental risk assessment of chemical mixtures is needed. A number of recent publications by the European Commission and the authorities in charge prove the increasing interest that is spreading in the European community towards the topic of the assessment of chemical mixtures. The current EU regulation for Plant Protection Products authorization (Reg. 1107/2009 EC) explicitly requires the evaluation of the potential combined effects of active substances. We reviewed current methods and limitations of mixture assessment of pesticides (7 fungicides and 4 herbicides) through the analysis of the approaches adopted to investigate possible risks for different non-target organisms. The Concentration Addition (CA) approach was the most used approach to predict multiple toxicity to non-target organisms. The guidance for birds and mammals first introduced standard procedures to assess the multiple toxicity based on on CA concept The recent aquatic EFSA guidance introduced some requirements to evaluate potential mixture toxicity, while the current guidance requirements for terrestrial organisms still lack clear indications on how to conduct the assessment Moreover, new indications come from the draft guidance for the assessment of terrestrial plants and in-soil organisms. However, the approval and implementation of these new guidelines are still at a developmental stage. Some final considerations are drawn on the future possibilities to improve risk assessment procedures so as to identify harmful effects of pesticides mixtures on non-target organisms.

None of the above fungicides was found to be as selective as prochloraz, which inhibited the in vitro growth of V. fungicola at very low concentrations (ED50 of 0.002 mu g ml(-1)) and was fungitoxic to A. bisporus at much higher levels (ED50 of 5.08 mu g ml(-1)). Tebuconazole was the least selective, followed by trifloxystrobin and famoxaclone, which exhibited satisfactory in vitro selectivity with ED50 values or 0.5 and 13.1 mu g ml(-1) for V. fungicola and A. bisporus, respectively. In trials in mushroom-growing rooms drench applications of formulated products of the above fungicides controlled the development of dry bubble disease oil cultures of A. bisporus artificially inoculated with V. fungicola 6 days after casing. The fungicides were applied one day before inoculation and the disease levels observed in the cultures treated with famoxadone, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin formulations were comparable to those obtained with the reference commercial products of prochloraz and carbendazim. Satisfactory disease control was achieved with the formulations of famoxadone, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin used as single applications at rates equal to or higher than 0.27, 1.2 and 1.2 g active ingredient per m(2) of culture, respectively. Differences in effectiveness between single and split applications were not observed. Although the number of diseased mushrooms was reduced by famoxadone, tebuconazole or trifloxystrobin, this was not reflected on yield increase or retention of basidiocarp whiteness of the commercial strains of A. bisporus used in the experiments.

In the absence of a three-dimensional structure of the target biopolymer, CoMFA and CoMSIA often provide a practical solution to an otherwise intractable problem of proper characterization of ligand-receptor interactions. These techniques are especially important in agrochemistry, where the number of known molecular structures of pesticide targets is limited. The use of CoMFA and CoMSIA in the agrochemical field for modelling the interactions of insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and herbicide safeners with their target binding sites is illustrated by using some selected published work. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models developed have been used successfully to map the properties of unknown receptors, construct hypotheses for ligand-receptor interactions, optimize lead structures, design novel active compounds, and predict biological activities.

The spread of this pest has led to the continuous usage of insecticides on crops. Some plant extracts have been used as a mixture to control insect pests and improve productivity. Methods: A plant-based mixture was mixed at a ratio of 1:1 v/v to demonstrate the effect on contact toxicity, feeding (no-choice test), and enzyme activities on S. litura. The active compounds of P. retrofractum and A. calamus were isolated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC). Results: Our results showed that binary mixtures from P. retrofractum and A. calamus exhibit the highest contact toxicity and antifeedant activity at a 1:1 ratio of LD30:LD10 dose (3.213 mu g/larva P. retrofractum + 3.294 mu g/larva A. calamus). The main active ingredient from each crude extract was (2E, 4E, 14Z)-N-isobutylicosa-2,4,14-trienamide from P. retrofractum, and beta-asarone and alpha-asarone from A. calamus. Additionally, A. calamus seems to be the synergistic compound.

Isolated cuticles, which represent the prime barrier to penetration, provide a physical system with which transport studies can be conducted under well-defined and highly controlled conditions while avoiding the physiological effects of biologically active compounds on the system. Most studies with isolated cuticles have focused on sorption, desorption and infinite-dose cuticular transport of compounds in aqueous systems. Partition coefficients can be calculated for pesticides from sorption data, thereby yielding information on the solubility of the compounds in the cuticle. Permeance and diffusion coefficients can be calculated from cuticular transport studies. These transport parameters provide for a better understanding of the mechanisms of cuticular penetration. Further, they are useful in comparing both the penetration characteristics of selected compounds and permeability of cuticles. Transport systems, using isolated cuticles, may be used to quantify the effects of spray additives on pesticide penetration. A finite-dose system is described that may be useful in studying spray droplet/deposit interactions with the cuticle and, concurrently, following transcuticular penetration from droplets/deposits on the surface.

An example is provided by the production of nanoenabled pesticides with the intention to optimize the efficiency of the pesticides. At the same time, it is important to collect information on the unintended and unwanted adverse effects of emerging nanopesticides on nontarget plants. Currently, this information is limited. In the present study, we compared the effects of a nanoformulation of atrazine (NPATZ) and the nonencapsulated atrazine formulation (ATZ) on physiological responses, defense mechanisms, and nutrient displacement in lettuce over time with the applied concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3 mg atrazine per kg soil. Our results revealed that both NPATZ and ATZ induced significant decreases in plant biomass, chlorophyll content, and protein content. Additionally, exposure to NPATZ and ATZ caused oxidative stress to the lettuce plant and significantly elevated the activities of the tested ROS scavenger enzymes in plant tissues. These results indicate that NPATZ and ATZ cause distinct adverse impacts on lettuce plants. When comparing the adverse effects in plants after exposure to NPATZ and ATZ, no obvious differences in plant biomass and chlorophyll content were observed between NPATZ and ATZ treatments at the same exposure concentration regardless of exposure duration. An enhanced efficiency of the active ingredient of the nanopesticide as compared to the conventional formulation was observed after long-term exposure to the high concentration of NPATZ, as it induced higher impacts on plants in terms of the end points of the contents of protein, superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)), and MDA, and the activities of stress-related enzymes as compared to the same concentration of ATZ. Furthermore, exposure to both NPATZ and ATZ disrupted the uptake of mineral nutrients in plants, and the differences in the displacement of nutrients between the NPATZ and ATZ treatments depended on the element type, plant organ, exposure concentration, and time. Overall, the application dose of a nanopesticide should balance their increased herbicidal efficiency with the long-term adverse effects in order to maximize the desired impact while minimizing adverse impacts; only then will we be able to understand the potential impact of nanopesticides on the environment.",2021,69,12527,12540,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c01382

The recent emergence of Zika virus in South America and the Pacific, together with ongoing outbreaks of dengue viruses in Southeast Asia, generated great community interest in the most effective strategies to avoid mosquito bites. Large-scale mosquito control programs are not common in Australia and are limited in New South Wales (NSW). The use of topical insect repellents is a key recommendation by health authorities to prevent mosquito-borne disease. All products sold in Australia purporting to repel mosquitoes must be registered with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Despite around 100 commercial products registered as repelling mosquitoes, there are relatively few active ingredients used across these formulations. The most common are diethyltoluamide (DEET), picaridin, p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) and a range of plant-derived products (e.g. melaleuca, eucalyptus, citronella oils). Research has shown that each of these active ingredients varies in the duration of protection provided against biting mosquitoes. Recommendations by health authorities are informed by this research, but inconsistencies between recommendations and available repellent formulations and their concentration of active ingredients can cause confusion in the community. There are conflicts between the data resulting from scholarly research, marketing promotion by manufacturers and recommendations provided by overseas health authorities.

The tests lasted 168 h. Comparison of the IC50 values for the seed germination and shoot growth inhibition of grasses and broad-leaved plants showed great differences. IC50 values obtained for L. sativitm and S. alba were in some cases nearly 100 times lower than the IC50 values for A. sativa and T. aestivian (both in seed germination and shoot inhibition tests). In the case of root growth inhibition, the differences between IC50 values for broad-leaved plants and grasses were less significant for Chwastox Extra. The IC50 values for germination were very high (ranged from 104 to 6704 mg(a,i) 1(-1)), but for shoot (S) or root (R) growth inhibition they were lower and ranged from 0.15 to 73 mg(a.i.) 1(-1) (S) and from 0.07 to 12 mg(a.i.) 1(-1) (R) for broad-leaved plants and grasses, respectively.

We studied the resulting DNA damage and cytotoxicity of various glyphosate concentrations on human cells to evaluate DNA damaging potential. Utilizing human Raji cells, DNA damage was quantified using the comet assay, while cytotoxicity was further analyzed using MTT viability assays. Several glyphosate concentrations were assessed, ranging from 15 mM to 0.1 mu M. We found that glyphosate treatment is lethal to Raji cells at concentrations above 10 mM, yet has no cytotoxic effects at concentrations at or below 100 mu M. Treatment concentrations of 1 mM and 5 mM induce statistically significant DNA damage to Raji cells following 30-60 min of treatment, however, cells show a slow recovery from initial damage and cell viability is unaffected after 2 h. At these same concentrations, cells treated with additional compound did not recover and maintained high levels of DNA damage. While the cytotoxicity of glyphosate appears to be minimal for physiologically relevant concentrations, the compound has a definitive cytotoxic nature in human cells at high concentrations.

HMWB cells were treated for 4 h at 37 degrees C with increasing concentrations (1-1000 mu M) of glyphosate alone and in three GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480 and Glyfos) to test cytotoxic effect with fluorescent colabelling and genotoxic effect with comet assay. In addition, each concentration was tested with and without metabolic activation using human liver S9 fraction. We found that glyphosate alone does not induce significant cytotoxicity and genotoxicity over the tested concentration range. Contrarily, GBHs induced statistically significant cell death from 250 mu M (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 500 mu M (Fozat 480), as well as statistically significant increase of DNA damage from 500 mu M (Roundup Mega and Glyfos) and 750 mu M (Fozat 480); however, the latter observation may not be explained by direct DNA injuries, rather due to the high level of cell death (> 70%) exerted by the formulations. Metabolic activation significantly increased the DNA damage levels induced by Glyfos, but not of the other GBHs and of glyphosate. The differences observed in the toxic pattern of formulations and the active principle may be attributed to the higher cytotoxic activity of other ingredients in the formulations or to the interaction of them with the active ingredient glyphosate. Hence, further investigation of formulations is crucial for assessing the true health risks of occupational and environmental exposures.",2019,179,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108851

In addition to harming the environment, overusing these pesticides causes pests to become resistant over time. Alternative methods and agrochemicals are therefore required to combat resistance. A potential solution to pesticide resistance and other issues may be found in nanotechnology. Due to their small size, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and ability to offer novel crop protection techniques, nanoformulations, primarily biopolymer-based ones, can address specific agricultural concerns. Several biopolymers can be employed to load pesticides, including starch, cellulose, chitosan, pectin, agar, and alginate. Other biopolymeric nanomaterials can load pesticides for targeted delivery, including gums, carrageenan, galactomannans, and tamarind seed polysaccharide (TSP). Aside from presenting other benefits, such as reduced toxicity, increased stability/shelf life, and improved pesticide solubility, biopolymeric systems are also cost-effective; readily available; biocompatible; biodegradable; and biosafe (i.e., releasing associated active compounds gradually, without endangering the environment) and have a low carbon footprint. Additionally, biopolymeric nanoformulations support plant growth while improving soil aeration and microbial activity, which may favor the environment.

However, there is only limited mention in agriculture, and there are no papers reporting its use as an herbicide safener. In this study, we provide the first evidence that S can effectively alleviate rice-seedling injury from metolachlor (M). We observed that the M-treated (0.25 mu M) rice seedlings, which were 56.0%, 66.0%, and 57.0% of the non-treated control in shoot height, root length, and fresh biomass, respectively, were recovered by S to 93.1%, 97.6%, and 94.8%, respectively. The emergence rate was enhanced to over 80% in the M+S treatment, whereas it was below 60% in the M treatment. This M+S mixture elevated the rice-seedling root activity to higher than 87.0% of the value for the non-treated control. The activity of glutathione transferases in the combined treatments approximately doubles that of the M treatment and quadruples that of the non-treated controls. This effect was positively correlated with the induced expression of OsGSTU3. Our results suggest that S may represent a new group of safeners and enable the possibility of using these compounds for improving plant production or protecting rice from the phytotoxicity of metolachlor.

Aerial application of pyrethroids, such as bifenthrin, has been a major practice adopted to manage this pest. Reports of field failure of pyrethroids have increased since 2013. Striacosta albicosta populations were collected in 2016 and 2017 from maize fields in Nebraska, Kansas, and Canada and screened with bifenthrin active ingredient in larval contact dose-response bioassays. Resistance ratios estimated were generally low in 2016 (1.04- to 1.32-fold) with the highest LC50 in North Platte, NE (66.10 ng/cm(2)) and lowest in Scottsbluff, NE (50.10 ng/cm(2)).

Implications of bifenthrin resistance levels were further investigated by aerial application simulations. Experiments were conducted with a spray chamber where representative S. albicosta populations were exposed to labeled rates of a commercial bifenthrin formulation. Experiments resulted in 100% mortality for all populations, instars, insecticide rates, and carrier volumes, suggesting that levels of resistance estimated for bifenthrin active ingredient did not seem to impact the efficacy of the correspondent commercial product under controlled conditions.

American members of the Lauraceae plant family are most susceptible and 300 million trees have been killed by the disease in the southeastern USA since 2003. Recently, commercial production of an important crop in the laurel family, avocado (Persea americana), has been affected in southern Florida. We summarize studies in which diverse measures were tested for managing the disease. In all studies, trees were treated with potential laurel wilt control measures and subsequently inoculated with R. lauricola. On potted plants in greenhouse experiments, commercial nutritional products (Greenstim and Keyplex 350) and SAR products (Agri-Fos and Nutri-Phite), when applied as soil drenches or foliar sprays, had either no impact on, or increased laurel wilt symptom development compared to non-treated control treatments. Bark applications of Tilt (a propiconazole fungicide for which emergency registration had been obtained in 2010) in a surfactant (Pentrabark) enabled significant laurel wilt protection in greenhouse studies on small potted plants, but Pentrabark and other surfactants moved little propiconazole into the xylem of fruit-bearing trees in field studies. In efficacy studies in the field, Propiconazole Pro (an injectable formulation of propiconazole), Tilt, and two experimental formulations of another triazole fungicide, tebuconazole, decreased the development of laurel wilt compared to nontreated control trees when applied as undiluted injections into branches and scaffold limbs (microinjection), or injection of dilute fungicide into tree flare roots (macroinfusion). However, symptoms developed in all treated trees by 10-11 months after inoculation with R. lauricola, indicating that trees would need to be re-treated at least on an annual basis. Regardless of how fungicides were applied, insignificant levels of different active ingredients entered fruit. Although fungicide treatment of fruit-bearing avocado trees is not a concern for food safety and several triazole and DMI fungicides can protect avocado trees from laurel wilt, cost-effective measures with which the xylem could be loaded with and protected by these products remains a challenge.

Thus the interaction between agriculture and amphibian health has been examined for decades. Many facets of amphibian physiology and ecology place them at high risk among the nontarget organisms affected by agricultural byproducts. Research has shown that many chemicals and fertilizers affect amphibian growth, reproduction, and survival. The impacts differ based on the type of agricultural byproduct (e.g., chemical pesticide or nutrient-heavy fertilizer) and amphibian species, but the effects are usually negative. However, minimal research exists on how organic biopesticides interact with amphibian populations. Biopesticides utilize insecticidal bacteria as the active ingredient in lieu of synthetic chemicals. The inert ingredients present in biopesticide commercial products are considered safe to nontarget organisms. The present study tested the impacts of a commercial biopesticide on the survival of amphibian embryos and larvae. We found that expected environmental concentrations of the microbial biopesticide Monterrey B.t. did not significantly reduce survival in embryos or larvae.

When applied to the root portion all formulations significantly reduced the number of egg masses and eggs per egg mass. Whereas on the untreated root portion, neem cake at 3% w/w and aza at 0.1% w/w significantly reduced the number of egg masses as compared with neem leaves at 3% w/w, aza at 0.05% and control. All the neern formulations significantly reduced the number of eggs per egg mass on' the untreated root portion. The effect of neem leaves and cake on the development of root-knot nematodes was tested at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 weeks after their application to soil. Even after 16 weeks all the treatments significantly reduced the galling index and number of egg masses but their effectiveness declined over time. After storing neem leaves, cake and aza for 8 months under ambient conditions the efficacy of neem leaves and aza, against root-knot nematodes, remained stable whereas that of cake declined.

This is because the oils and surfactants within the formulation play the role of adjuvants. Therefore, an OD formulation may show a better biological efficacy, making the addition of tank mix adjuvant (regularly used in association with systemic pesticides) optional. The main goal of this work was to develop a new insecticide OD formulation with active ingredients that would be produced as a suspoemulsion (SE), resulting in a better and easier way of formulating a commercial product. These formulations were developed with new surfactants and dispersants and were stabilized using different rheology modifiers, showing appropriate results in stability tests. Rheological assessments were also performed in order to understand system microstructure. The new insecticides' OD formulations also exhibited excellent performance in physical-chemical lab tests and were subjected to field trials with cotton crops at Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso, Brazil, during the 2012-2013 season. The target insect evaluated in this study was the cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boh. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), which is primarily responsible for damage to Brazilian cotton.

The lack of efficacy of commercial products in its control results from poor application and/or from its resistance to active ingredients. A new insecticide, spinosad, was tested against mobile stages of the red mite in laboratory and field populations. Laboratory trials showed increasing efficacy five days (adults) and six days (nymphs) after exposure. Laboratory results were confirmed in a field trial conducted under commercial conditions. The trial was conducted in three separate houses on farms with high natural mite populations. The first and second houses were sprayed with concentrations of 2,000 and 4,000 ppm of spinosad (2 and 4 g/L), whereas the third house was used as an untreated control. Spraying was conducted using a sprayer (Stadikopumpe VAAR 252-200 LE, Dinklage, Germany) with a 200 L reservoir with permanent stirring, a 50 m long flexible tube with a double jet system, and jet size of 0.08 mm. The pressure used was 6-10 bar. Sampling was conducted immediately before the application and once a week for 56 days in the first house and 93 days in the second. In the first house, almost 100% reduction in mite numbers was observed until 28 days post treatment; 74.3% reduction was observed 49 days after treatment. In the second house, rates of reduction were higher than 90% until day 77. The untreated control house maintained high red mite infestations throughout the experimental period.

However, the aqueous solubility and soil sorption of this compound can cause problems of toxicity in nontarget organisms. This work investigates the preparation and characterization of nanoparticles composed of chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) to produce an efficient herbicidal formulation that was less toxic and could be used for safer control of weeds in agriculture. The toxicities of the formulations were evaluated using cell culture viability assays and the Allium cepa chromosome aberration test. The herbicidal activity was investigated in cultivations of maize (Zea mays) and mustard (Brassica sp.), and soil sorption of the nanoencapsulated herbicide was measured. The efficiency association of paraquat with the nanoparticles was 62.6 +/- 0.7%. Encapsulation of the herbicide resulted in changes in its diffusion and release as well as its sorption by soil. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assays showed that the nanoencapsulated herbicide was less toxic than the pure compound, indicating its potential to control weeds while at the same time reducing environmental impacts. Measurements of herbicidal activity showed that the effectiveness of paraquat was preserved after encapsulation. It was concluded that the encapsulation of paraquat in nanoparticles can provide a useful means of reducing adverse impacts on human health and the environment, and that the formulation therefore has potential for use in agriculture.

Current pest control practices involving the excessive use of synthetic insecticides over many years have resulted in aphid resistance to a number of pesticides. In nature, plants produce secondary metabolites during their interaction with insects and these metabolites can act as toxicants, antifeedants, anti-oviposition agents and deterrents towards the insects. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the butanol fraction from a crude methanolic extract of an important plant species, Isodon rugosus showed strong insecticidal activity against the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. To further explore this finding, the current study aimed to exploit a bioactivity-guided strategy to isolate and identify the active compound in the butanol fraction of I. rugosus. As such, reversed-phase flash chromatography, acidic extraction and different spectroscopic techniques were used to isolate and identify the new compound, rosmarinic acid, as the bioactive compound in I. rugosus. Insecticidal potential of rosmarinic acid against A. pisum was evaluated using standard protocols and the data obtained was analyzed using qualitative and quantitative statistical approaches. Considering that a very low concentration of this compound (LC90 = 5.4 ppm) causes significant mortality in A. pisum within 24 h, rosmarinic acid could be exploited as a potent insecticide against this important pest insect. Furthermore, I. rugosus is already used for medicinal purposes and rosmarinic acid is known to reduce genotoxic effects induced by chemicals, hence it is expected to be safer compared to the current conventional pesticides. While this study highlights the potential of I. rugosus as a possible biopesticide source against A. pisum, it also provides the basis for further exploration and development of formulations for effective field application.",2019,14,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215048

The vector control insecticide market represents a small fraction of the crop protection market and is estimated to be valued at up to $500 million at the active ingredient level. Insecticide resistance towards the current WHOPES-approved products urgently requires the development of new tools to protect communities against the transmission of malaria. The evaluation of commercial products for malaria vector control is a viable and cost effective strategy to identify new malaria vector control products. Several examples of such spin-offs from crop protection insecticides are already evidencing the success of this strategy, namely pirimiphos-methyl for indoor residual sprays and spinosad, diflubenzuron, novaluron, and pyriproxifen for mosquito larvae control, a supplementary technology for control of malaria vectors. In our study the adulticidal activities of 81 insecticides representing 23 insecticidal modes of action classes, 34 fungicides from 6 fungicidal mode of action classes and 15 herbicides from 2 herbicidal modes of action classes were tested in a newly developed screening system. WHOPES approved insecticides for malaria vector control consistently caused 80-100% mortality of adult Anopheles stephensi at application rates between 0.2 and 20 mg active ingradient (Al) litre(-1).

Fenuron was selected as model of a very mobile and highly water-soluble herbicide. Two different organoclays of high (A-HDT) and low (H-CIS) reversible fenuron sorption were selected. Herbicide-organoclay complexes were prepared from the two organoclays and with two different fenuron contents (20 and 40 g AI kg(-1)) and two different mixing times, so as to form a series of weak and strong complexes. The release of fenuron from those complexes into water and water/soil suspensions gave values of T-50 (time to release 50% of the fenuron content) ranging from 0.3 min to 2400 h. The total fenuron released in these closed systems ranged from 48 to 80% of the fenuron in the complex. The organoclay type (high or low sorptivity) had the greatest influence on fenuron release, followed by the strong or weak complex, suggesting that herbicide-organoclay interactions are the main factors controlling release. Soil column leaching experiments showed fenuron-organoclay complexes to be effective in reducing the peak herbicide concentration in the leachate to a half (6 muM) or a quarter (3 muM) of that obtained from the free technical compound (12 muM). Herbicide lost through leaching was reduced from 78% for the free technical fenuron to 50-30%, depending on the organoclay used as carrier and the strength of the complex. Bioassay with ryegrass showed that the weak fenuron/H-C18 complex (40 g AI kg(-1)) gave the same herbicidal activity as technical fenuron.

Toxic effects of different types of pyrethroids to fish has been well described but there is a dearth of data on their effects to aquatic crustaceans. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a commercial product Cyperkill 25 EC (25% of cypermethrin as an active substance) on oxidative stress and antioxidants activity in marbled crayfish. DESIGN: The juvenile crayfish were exposed to two concentrations of Cyperkill 25 EC: 0.02 mu g. L-1 (10% 96hLC50) and 0.05 mu g. L-1 (30% 96hLC50) for 72 hours. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transpherase (GST) and reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were assessed in the whole-body homogenate. RESULTS: Cyperkill 25 EC in both tested concentrations caused significant (p<0.01) decreased in levels of TBARS. Changes in the antioxidants activity were observed in every examined parameters except for the catalase. Cyperkill 25 EC in concentration 0.05 mu g.

Unfortunately, this pesticide use poses significant health and ecological threat through the presence of residues in food, groundwater and surface water, especially since some alarming practices, and their impacts are, in most cases, poorly known, such as mixing of pesticides. This study focuses on the evaluation of the pressure of pesticide use on groundnut crop, and their impacts on the environment and human health from the determination of agro-environmental indicators (NT, QASI, TFI and EIQ) through field surveys conducted on 94 different groundnut farms representing an area of 313 ha. The results showed that groundnut crop is characterized by heavy pesticide use with an average treatment frequency of 9.97 treatments per cycle, dominated by herbicide treatments and by a variety of products used; 20 commercial products corresponding to 17 different active ingredients, including herbicides (71%), fungicides (22%) and insecticides (7%). According to survey results, all weed treatments were carried out by mixing two to three herbicides. The worst identified agricultural practice was that some of the pesticides used are not registered on this crop and used irrationally. For pesticide pressure, the average total TFI determined is 14.94. Moreover, in this study, the quantity of active substances indicator (QASI) was estimated for the first time revealing an increased use of pesticides equal to 6.17 kg/ha.

The similarity of changes in current for various nitrobenzenes enables the exclusion of the formation of adducts or micelles as the predominant effect. The decrease of the limiting currents in all cases is much smaller than the decrease of DPP peak currents, due to strong effects of the surfactants on the kinetics of electroreduction.

Molluscicides were first tested within Petri dishes to facilitate behavioural observations related to attraction or repellency of food baits and other products added to filter paper, and mortality of snails exposed to chemicals in this manner. Promising chemicals were then tested in greenhouse trials. Chemicals tested included a wide variety of commercial products containing metaldehyde; methiocarb (a carbamate); a bait product containing iron phosphate; a copper-containing fungicide; two extracts of neem (azadirachtin and neem oil) and an experimental extract of yucca known to repel slugs and snails. There was no evidence that snails were attracted to any of the food baits. The liquid metaldehyde products and the yucca extract caused snails to withdraw immediately into their shells and avoid contact with treated filter paper for up to 1 week.

The phenol compound carvacrol can serve as an alternative method for controlling R. microplus; however, environmental factors can increase its volatility. A microencapsulation technique using yeast cell walls can prolong the acaricide action of carvacrol, acting as a physical barrier against such environmental action. The aim of the present study was to investigate the encapsulation of carvacrol with yeast cell walls and its activity against resistant R. microplus larvae. Carvacrol was encapsulated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls; acaricide activity and volatility were measured using a larval immersion test with resistant strains of R. microplus. The efficacy of the encapsulation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Fourier transform spectroscopy revealed similar vibrational peaks between the analyzed samples, supporting the scanning electron microscopy results that encapsulation occurred. The size difference between the yeast cell walls (diameter 2.5 +/- 0.2 mu m) and the encapsulated carvacrol (diameter de 4.5 +/- 0.5 mu m) was statistically significant (P > 0.001). The encapsulated carvacrol showed the highest larvicidal activity against R. microplus, exhibiting a lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of 0.71 mg/mL; the LC50 of carvacrol alone was 1.82 mg/mL.

The water of Guapore River and its tributaries were highly contaminated by many pesticides, especially by four herbicides (2,4-D, atrazine, deethyl-atrazine, and simazine), three fungicides (carbendazim, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole), and one insecticide (imidacloprid). The amount, type, and concentration of pesticides detected were completely different depending on the sampling technic used. POCIS was effective to discriminate the contamination according to the main land use of each sampling site. The monitored areas with the predominance of soybean cultivation under no-tillage tended to have higher concentrations of fungicide, while in the more diversified region, the herbicides showed higher values. The presence of five herbicides used in corn and grassland forage production was correlated with areas of integrated crop-livestock systems, in contrast to higher contamination by 2,4-D in areas of intensive production of soybean and winter cereals.",2020,27,10581,10598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06550-8

Each plant was considered as an experimental unit. On the first essay the treatments were: absolute control (water), Neemazal (R) (1.2% Azadirachtin) at doses of 12; 24; 48; 96 and 192 ppm of azadirachtin. On the second: absolute control (water) and seed extract using 1; 2; 4; 8 and 16 g/100 ml. On the third, leaf extract was applied at the same rate as for seeds. For each essay a positive control was added by using the commercial product Applaud(I (Buprofezin) at 1.5 g.c.p./L, which corresponds to 0.375g of the active ingredient (i.a.)/L of water. Azadirachtin at all dosages was effective and caused up to 98% reduction on alive nymphs number. When applied over 24 ppm, this compound showed the same efficiency as the standard buprofezin.

The low-molecular-mass bioemulsifiers are generally glycolipids, such as trehalose lipids, sophorolipids and rhamnolipids, or lipopeptides, such as surfactin, gramicidin S and polymyxin. The high-molecular-mass bioemulsifiers are amphipathic polysaccharides, proteins, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins or complex mixtures of these biopolymers. The low-molecular-mass bioemulsifiers lower surface and interfacial tensions, whereas the higher-molecular-mass bioemulsifiers are more effective at stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. Three natural roles for bioemulsifiers have been proposed: (i) increasing the surface area of hydrophobic water-insoluble growth substrates; (ii) increasing the bioavailability of hydrophobic substrates by increasing their apparent solubility or desorbing them from surfaces; (iii) regulating the attachment and detachment of microorganisms to and from surfaces. Bioemulsifiers have several important advantages over chemical surfactants, which should allow them to become prominent in industrial and environmental applications. The potential commercial applications of bioemulsifiers include bioremediation of oil-polluted soil and water, enhanced oil recovery, replacement of chlorinated solvents used in cleaning-up oil-contaminated pipes, vessels and machinery, use in the detergent industry, formulations of herbicides and pesticides and formation of stable oil-in-water emulsions for the food and cosmetic industries.",1999,52,154,162,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002530051502

The plant has been extensively studied for its content of saponins, mainly consisting of triterpene glycosides of medicagenic acid, possessing several biological properties including a biocidal activity on different soil microorganisms. Phytoparasitic nematodes are responsible for heavy economic damages to numerous agricultural crops and, due to their large distribution, they are among the most difficult crop pests to control. Attention on environmental safety and human and animal health has led to the progressive dismission of many synthetic formulations for the control of those pests and to the search of alternative strategies, including the use of natural metabolites from plants. Saponins from M. sativa may be good candidates for natural nematicide formulations, as in our in vitro studies the saponin mixtures from M. sativa tissues have been found effective in vitro against the virus-vector nematode Xiphinema index, the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita and the potato cyst parasite, Globodera rostochiensis. A structure-activity relationship among saponins and related prosapogenins and sapogenin, respectively, has also been analyzed. The nematicidal efficacy differed among the three assayed nematode species, G. rostochiensis being the most susceptible to the active compounds from alfalfa. The in vitro results were also confirmed by experiments in potting mixes infested by M. incognita or G. rostochiensis and amended with dry top and root material from M. sativa, and in field trials on M. incognita and carrot cyst nematode Heterodera carotae with M. sativa pelleted meal.

Various factors have been studied with respect to the extent of complexing and the size and morphology of the complexes produced, including protein type and the biopolymer mixing ratio. The effect of applying ultrasound has been considered with a view to comminuting precipitates produced under low shear to the colloidal scale to form co-acervates. A simple model is suggested to explain how the biopolymer mixing ratio influences the ability for application of ultrasound to convert macroscopically phase-separated complex precipitates into co-acervates. Different factors, both from a formulation and processing viewpoint, were studied with respect to encapsulation efficiency (EE) of model hydrophilic actives: fluorescein, rhodamine B, and riboflavin. Release of fluorescein and rhodamine B was measured as function of pH in order to investigate the pH-responsive molecular release capability of the fabricated structures. It is envisaged this work will add to the current tool-box of pH-responsive molecular delivery approaches, including those in the areas of foods, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.

The effects of initial ratio, structures of volatile compounds and polymers, i.e. cellulose, acetate cellulose and rice husk, on the release profiles were investigated. Four monoterpenes, namely alpha-pinene, citronellal, carvone and terpinen-4-ol, were tested as volatile compound models. In the case of carvone loaded onto cellulose, we observed that the release of the volatile molecule increases with increasing initial ratio in the formulation. Using different cellulose-based matrix to study the volatility of monoterpene models, the lowest release rates was obtained with rice husk formulations, with highly retention capacity over 50% for carvone, terpinen-4-ol and citronellal after 20 days at 21 degrees C. It was also concluded that the impregnation of terpinen-4-ol and carvone into cellulose and cellulose acetate respectively, could effectively help in prolonging the retention of these volatiles. alpha-Pinene, a highly hydrophobic molecule showed no significant retention. These results indicate that cellulose-based matrices could be potentially used as good carriers of active compounds for ecological pesticides formulation for postharvest applications.

Their constant use and the lack of alternatives in the market may favor the perception of these substances by ants, causing rejection for foraging and consequent difficulty in their control. In this respect, this study examined the mortality of leaf-cutting ants of the genera Atta and Acromyrmex subjected to direct application with dry powders, in laboratory conditions. As a preliminary treatment, a commercial antiseptic talc powder (C. A. P. T.) was used, followed by isolated treatments that corresponded to its components with potential insecticidal action, namely, salicylic acid, sulfur, boric acid, zinc oxide, in addition to an inert talc powder (Quimidrol (R)) as the control. For each treatment, 40 (worker) ants, whose activity was reduced due to remaining in a refrigerator prior to the treatment, were placed in transparent crystal polystyrene ('Gerbox' type) and were sprinkled with a salt shaker. The ants were kept at 25 +/- 2 degrees C, under a 12-h photophase, and cumulative mortality was recorded every 24 h, considering dead ants as those that were unable to maintain the natural position of their body, i.e., even dying ants were considered dead when they exhibited no reaction when touched by a paintbrush. When sprinkled on ants, C. A. P. T. causes 40% mortality in both species 24 h after application. Subsequent studies of the components of this commercial product have found that when sprinkled on both Atta sexdens rubropilosa and Acromyrmex crassispinus, salicylic acid causes 100% mortality of workers in the first 24 h.

In order to identify new strategies to counter the threat of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms, essential oils (EOs) have become an important potential in the treatment of fungal infections. EOs and their bioactive pure compounds have been found to exhibit a wide range of remarkable biological activities. We investigated the in vitro antifungal activity of nine commercial EOs such as Thymus vulgaris (thyme red), Origanum vulgare (oregano), Lavandula vera (lavender), Pinus sylvestris (pine), Foeniculum vulgare (fennel), Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), Salvia officinalis (sage), Eugenia caryophyllata (clove) and Pelargonium asperum (geranium), and some of their main components (alpha-pinene, carvacrol, citronellal, eugenol, gamma-terpinene, linalool, linalylacetate, terpinen-4-ol, thymol) against non-albicans Candida strains and uncommon yeasts.

Pine exhibited strong antifungal activity against the selected non-albicans Candida isolates and uncommon yeasts. In addition, lemon balm EOs and alpha-pinene exhibited strong antifungal activity against the selected non-albicans Candida yeasts. Thymol inhibited the growth of all uncommon yeasts.

Here, we explored, for the first time, the ability of rhamnolipids (RLs) to control this pathogen, using a total of 19 RLs, including a natural RL mixture produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 18 bioinspired RLs synthesized using green chemistry, as well as two related compounds (lauric acid and dodecanol). These compounds were assessed for in vitro antifungal effect, in planta defence elicitation (peroxidase and catalase enzyme activities), and protection efficacy on the wheat-Z. tritici pathosystem. Interestingly, a structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that synthetic RLs with a 12 carbon fatty acid tail were the most effective for all examined biological activities. This highlights the importance of the C12 chain in the bioactivity of RLs, likely by acting on the plasma membranes of both wheat and Z. tritici cells. The efficacy of the most active compound Rh-Est-C12 was 20-fold lower in planta than in vitro; an optimization of the formulation is thus required to increase its effectiveness. No Z. tritici strain-dependent activity was scored for Rh-Est-C12 that exhibited similar antifungal activity levels towards strains differing in their resistance patterns to demethylation inhibitor fungicides, including multi-drug resistance strains.

The insecticides are the main tool to control these moths in the stores. The data describing the response of these moths to insecticides are scarce. The lethal effect of the organophosphate, pyrethroid, and halogenated-pyrrole on moths larvae were compared in laboratory test. The hypothesis was that the very polyphagous P. interpunctella would have generally higher insecticide tolerance than that of the stenophagous E. kuehniella. Different insecticide concentrations were applied onto the inner surface of glass tube vials. Ten larvae of 14 or 21 d old of E. kuehniella and 7 or 14 d old of P. interpunctella were used by treatment. The larval mortality was checked after 24 h of exposure. The mortality was significantly influenced by age of larvae and the groups of chemicals. No differences among the efficacies of the tested formulations with identical active compounds were found, except significant different mortality of E. kuehniella on deltamethrin formulations. A comparison of analytical standards showed that P. interpunctella was less susceptible to the active ingredient pirimiphos-methyl than E. kuehniella, while E. kuehniella was less susceptible to deltamethrin than P. interpunctella. No differences between the two species were observed for chlorfenapyr. We therefore rejected the hypothesis that polyphagy/stenophagy can be a general predictor of insecticide tolerance in the two tested storage moths.

Experimental results for solutions prepared from the pure ingredients were compared to those prepared from the appropriate formulated commercial products. At small concentrations, the extent of adsorption of the active ingredient was higher than from the formulation containing solutions. Environmental fate and effects of the forming agents are less investigated because they rarely have concentration limits recommended by authorities. In addition to the adsorption of active ingredients, therefore, the sorption behavior of a widely used additive Supragil WP (sodium diisopropyl naphthalene sulphonate) was also studied. This dispersant is an anionic forming agent applied in a lot of pesticide formulations. Using three different soils (sand, brown forest, chernozem) as adsorbents two-step isotherms were obtained. The role of the soil organic matter (OM) was significant in the adsorption mechanism because the adsorbed amounts of the dispersant correlated with the specific surface area as well as with the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the soils. The sorption behavior indicates the operation of hydrophobic interaction mechanism between the soil OM and the dispersant. These results are supported by our further sorption experiments on clays, too. Zeta potential measurements seem to be promising for the interpretation of multi-step isotherms. The application of this technique proved that higher concentrations of the anionic forming agent assisted the peptization of soil organic matter (SOM) resulting in stable colloidal solution dominated by negative charges. Since the pesticides investigated are also anionic at the studied pH (7 and 8.3) the dissolved organics lead to the enhancement of the mobility of both the sulfonylureas and dispersant.",2013,48,758,766,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2013.780853

Surprisingly, the A. cepa oil was more toxic than methomyl, and the other plant oils possessed toxicity accounted to 74-80% and 83-98% of methomyl toxicity when comparisons were made at the LD50 and LD90 levels, respectively. Combining plant oils with insecticides resulted in different types of interaction (e.g., synergism, additive and antagonism). Such results may be considered as novel findings in the course of searching for potent botanical insecticides against the locust, S. gregaria, and magnify the industrial value of such plant oils in the era of biopesticides.

This study aimed to identify metabolites from Sparassis latifolia that have nematicidal activity and to investigate the effect of water-soluble formulations of the active compounds for use as trunk-injectable control agents against the nematode B. xylophilus. When the submerged cultures of S. latifolia were bioassayed against B. xylophilus, strain KFRI 747 showed the most potent activity (52.8%), followed by KFRI 1080 (44.4%) and KFRI 645 (34.8%); their activities were correlated with the concentration of sparassol in their mycelia. Six fractions (SLE1-6) were obtained from ethyl acetate extracts of the liquid culture medium; nematicidal activity was found only in SLE4 (which included sparassol). Sparassol bioassayed against B. xylophilus and had LC50 and LC95 of 84.92 and 132.13 ppm, respectively. Sparassol was modified to disodium sparassol using NaOH because sparassol was not water-soluble and thus was not useful as an agent for trunk injection. Disodium sparassol exhibited similar nematicidal activity to that found with sparassol. The trunk-injectable nematicides (abamectin and emamectin benzoate) were more effective than sparassol and disodium sparassol in terms of LC50 and LC95 values. However, sparassol has a more simple chemical structure than these compounds and could be more easily synthesized. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that disodium sparassol might be useful as nematicide for use against the pine wood nematode.

Effects on a number of tillers and dry matter production per unit area and grain yield in sets of eight and nine winter wheat varieties were investigated in 1991/1992, 1992/1993 and 1993/1994. The results obtained in 1991/1992 showed that pre-emergent and post-emergent application of herbicides which contained chlortoluron as one of effective agents to the Hana variety caused reduction of plant weight in all cases studied. Significant reduction was recorded after the pre-emergent application of Syntop, Assert + chlortoluron and a combination of Dicuran 80 WP + Aminex. In 1992/1993, the pre-emergent autumn application of Pendiron and post-emergent spring one of three formulations of chlortoluron were investigated in a set of nine winter wheat varieties. Pendiron showed phytotoxicity expressed in considerable growth hindering. A number of tilters was lower in all varieties when compared to a check variety, and significantly lower in Vega and Torysa varieties in which grain yield was also significantly reduced. Significant yield reduction was determined in Livia too. Bt three chlortoluron formulations in spring post-emergent application significant yield loss was assessed in Vega and Torysa. In 1993/1994, responses of nine winter wheat varieties to the post-emergent autumn application with chlortoluron contained in three commercial products were studied. The varieties Vega, Bruta and Sida showed significant reduction of a tiller number after all of the products applied. Dry matter yield per unit area was reduced in all varieties studied, and significantly reduced in Vega, Bruta and Sida after all products. In the varieties Asta, Siria, Danita and Simona - after the products which are marked with asterisks (Fig. 4). Grain yield was significantly lower in Vega. Based on statistical evaluation, the application of chlortoluron can be considered as a measure which could cause the reduction of production ability, including yield loss in sensitive varieties. That can be increased in fields which do not enable higher compensation of a lower tiller number and biomass dry matter at early growth and developmental stages. Despite high yield potential, the varieties Vega, Bruta, Torysa and Sida were sensitive.",1995,41,505,509,NA

Such disruption can be achieved with redox-active compounds. Natural phenolic compounds can serve as potent redox cyclers that inhibit microbial growth through destabilization of cellular redox homeostasis and/or antioxidation systems. The aim of this study was to identify benzaldehydes that disrupt the fungal antioxidation system. These compounds could then function as chemosensitizing agents in concert with conventional drugs or fungicides to improve antifungal efficacy. Methods: Benzaldehydes were tested as natural antifungal agents against strains of Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. terreus and Penicillium expansum, fungi that are causative agents of human invasive aspergillosis and/or are mycotoxigenic. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was also used as a model system for identifying gene targets of benzaldehydes. The efficacy of screened compounds as effective chemosensitizers or as antifungal agents in formulations was tested with methods outlined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Results: Several benzaldehydes are identified having potent antifungal activity. Structure-activity analysis reveals that antifungal activity increases by the presence of an ortho-hydroxyl group in the aromatic ring. Use of deletion mutants in the oxidative stress-response pathway of S. cerevisiae (sod1 Delta, sod2 Delta, glr1 Delta) and two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mutants of A. fumigatus (sakA Delta, mpkC Delta), indicates antifungal activity of the benzaldehydes is through disruption of cellular antioxidation. Certain benzaldehydes, in combination with phenylpyrroles, overcome tolerance of A. fumigatus MAPK mutants to this agent and/or increase sensitivity of fungal pathogens to mitochondrial respiration inhibitory agents. Synergistic chemosensitization greatly lowers minimum inhibitory (MIC) or fungicidal (MFC) concentrations. Effective inhibition of fungal growth can also be achieved using combinations of these benzaldehydes. Conclusions: Natural benzaldehydes targeting cellular antioxidation components of fungi, such as superoxide dismutases, glutathione reductase, etc., effectively inhibit fungal growth. They possess antifungal or chemosensitizing capacity to enhance efficacy of conventional antifungal agents. Chemosensitization can reduce costs, abate resistance, and alleviate negative side effects associated with current antifungal treatments.",2011,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-0711-10-23

In this study, the active compound of R. pseudoacacia was isolated from the plant extract, and the structure was identified to be D-Pinitol by nuclear magnetic resonance. D-Pinitol, as a known compound, has important physiological activity on plant osmotic tolerance and medicinal activities on human health. This study is the first to report the antifungal activity of D-pinitol on an obligate parasite S. fuliginea and tried to develop a phytochemical fungicide. The evaluation in the growth chamber showed that the control effect of D-pinitol and its formulation against cucumber powdery mildew disease was 80.7% and 94.4%, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This formulation was further tested in a greenhouse to evaluate its control effect against cucumber (S. fuliginea) and tobacco (Erysiphe cichoracearum) powdery mildew under natural condition. The efficacy of D-pinitol in both trials was better than that of positive control at the recommended concentration. The content of D-pinitol in this plant was 25 mg/g (w/w, dry leaves weight) as determined by gas chromatography. The abundant biomass of D-pinitol in R. pseudoacacia plant extract makes it more economical in practical use. Our study provides a base for the future exploitation of D-pinitol as a natural phytochemical fungicide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An example of permissive control to tackle DHF issue is the use of chemical-based fogging for fumigation. However, insecticide has an active compound that causes mosquito resistance and it has been discovered to have side effects on the human body. Its application in fogging also requires petroleum fuels as smoke-making agent. This study intends to substitute fluids formulation in fogging formula. This formulation aims to create liquid fogging products that are free from pyrethroid and petroleum, so fumigation becomes safer for its users. The research was done by formulating tobacco leaf extract as an active insecticide substance with a solvent from propylene glycol and glycerin as a smoke-making agent. The independent variables in this study were the concentration of the active substance and the ratio of solvent (PG:VG).

We investigated the acute toxic effects of the herbicide formulation Focus Ultra [with the active ingredient (a.i.) cycloxydim plus solvent naphtha and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate as added substances] on embryos and early stage larvae of the Moroccan painted frog (Discoglossus scovazzi). Different clinical signs (twitching, convulsion, and narcosis) occurred at 40 and 80 mg/L in embryos (4 and 8 mg a.i./L) and narcotic effects (total immobilization or irregular escape responses) at 10, 15, and 20 mg/L in larvae (1, 1.5, and 2 mg a.i./L). Growth inhibition (total length), starting at 20 mg/L in embryos and 2.5 mg/L in larvae (2 and 0.25 mg a.i./L, respectively) was understood as sign of toxicity (retardation) and not as sign of teratogenicity. However, the connection to teratogenesis remained unclear though total length reduction occurred at concentrations < 20 % of the 96-h LC50 value and at a minimum concentration that inhibits growth of only 17 % of the 96-h LC50 value. Starting at 20 mg/L, mortality in embryos significantly increased and at 15 mg/L in early larvae (2 and 1.5 mg a.i./L, respectively). Mortality of larvae was enhanced during the first 24 h of exposure to 15 and 20 mg/L (1.5 and 2 mg a.i./L). Morphology of the embryos remained unobtrusive. In contrary, axial malformations significantly increased in the early larvae starting at 10 mg/L (1 mg a.i./L), a concentration free of lethal effects. In all considered end points, larvae were significantly more sensitive than embryos, probably because of developmental and physiological properties or different exposure and bioavailability of the compound. Focus Ultra induced comparable lethal and immobilization effects in D. scovazzi as it does to standard test organisms in pesticide approval. However, to validate the apparent safety in the field, which is based on calculated surface water concentrations of the a.i., more data on real contamination levels is necessary (e.g., peak concentrations, concentrations of added substances).

While several commercial products based on microorganisms have been developed and registered under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), actual use of these biocontrol agents for protection of crops against insects, weeds, and plant pathogens has been limited and accounts for less than 2% of total pesticide use today. Factors contributing to this low usage include costly and inefficient production methods (especially for fungi and viruses), poor storage stability, and susceptibility to environmental degradation. These are caused by exposure to temperature and pH extremes, desiccation, moisture, proteolytic enzyme activity from both plants and resident microbes, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Other factors contributing to the limited usage of biopesticides are: susceptibility only at specific development stage of target pest or weed, slow action for infectivity and mortality, requirement for specific environmental conditions for efficacy, and need for thorough spray coverage. Despite these limitations, industry is commited to the development of biopesticides as environmentally friendly alternatives to synthetic chemicals. This may be the result of public concern and demand to significantly reduce or even eliminate the pesticide residues in the food chain, rapid and excessive development of pest and disease resistance to chemicals, and high costs associated with the development and registration of a new chemical active ingredient. Significant progress in formulation and application method has been made to protect the biopesticides from environmental degradation. These developments include: non-aqueous formulations, incorporation of UV protectants, starch and sodium alginate encapsulation, and adjuvants for wash-off resistance, humectancy, increased infectivity, and enhanced activity. In addition, genetic engineering technologies, such as bioencapsulation and transgenic plants have been designed to protect and extend the activity of Bacillus thuringiensis. This paper will review the work done in the area of formulations and delivery systems to enhance and extend activity of biopesticides. Primary emphasis will be on Bacillus thuringiensis, which represents more than 90% of today's biopesticide market for agronomic crops, forestry, and aquatic pest control.",1998,1347,242,272,http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP14169S

For first time use in a pesticide delivery system, a two-step milling process for preparing a nanosuspension in a system of active compound/surfactant/water is described in this paper. First, all the components were mixed at a certain composition to prepare a microsuspension by the general milling process. Then, the microsuspension was taken into a nanomilling process with zirconium oxide beads, having a diameter range of 0.1-0.2 mm, as the milling media to generate the nanosuspension. Therefore, a nanosuspension concentrate was formed. To demonstrate the potential applications of this novel system, it was used to make a formulation with a poorly soluble crystalline insecticide, carbofuran. In a comparative study, two kinds of carbofuran formulations, a microsuspension (commercial) and a nanosuspension, were administered to a diamondback moth (DBM) to test their efficacy and stability as a pesticide. The results indicate that carbofuran has the same efficacy at a lower dose for the nanosuspension compared to the microsuspension. The nanosuspension system was also physically and chemically stable over a period of 2 years, as indicated by the unchanged particle size and specification tests.",2011,50,7637,7643,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie2001007

These insecticides, however, show very strong toxicity to pollinating insects and in particular to the honey bee, besides causing also other effects which are often not easily identifiable, such as behavioural disturbances, orientation difficulties, and impairment of social activities. During the past few years, in many countries, alarming bee mortality rates were recorded. In some cases this was clearly due to the use of neonicotinoids either for seed dressing or crop spraying. It was therefore considered appropriate to test on three strains of Apis mellifera of Piedmontese origin and referable to A. in. ligustica in the laboratory both the acute oral toxicity of Imidacloprid, which had been, in use for many years, and Clothianidin and Thiametoxam, only more recently introduced in Italy.

They were tested at the recommended concentration for field treatments. When mortality was higher in the tested bees than in the untreated ones, the active ingredients were tested at gradually decreasing concentrations so as to reach a mortality not significantly different from that found in the untreated controls.

Nanoparticles are wen studied for drug delivery and sustained release but not in the agricultural sciences, because of the difficulty in generating stable pesticide nanoparticles with controlled particle size distribution and because the processes to generate nanoparticles are usually costly. In this paper, a model pesticide, bifenthrin, has been prepared in nanoparticle form by using the Flash NanoPrecipitation process. The process involves rapid micromixing to effect supersaturation, and polymer assembly to control particle size. RESULTS: A multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) was developed to provide rapid micromixing, high supersaturation and rapid nucleation and growth of bifenthrin nanoparticles. Several polymeric stabilizers were tested. With an increase in pesticide loading from 50 to 91%, nanoparticle size increased from 100 to 200 nm. The stability of the nanoparticle dispersions was followed for more than 12 days. The steric stability caused by the corona structure of the hydrophilic block of the polymers prevents nanoparticles aggregation. Ostwald ripening is responsible for the slow particle size growth observed. CONCLUSION: Flash NanoPrecipitation using an MIVM provides a cost-effective process to produce stable pesticide nanoparticle suspensions. Nanoparticle size depends on supersaturation, pesticide loading and type of polymer. Nanoparticle pesticides potentially provide higher efficiency, better uniformity of coverage for highly active compounds and less exposure to workers, relative to compounds solubilized in organic solvents.

First an oil-in-water emulsion was formed and afterwards the emulsion was dried by spray-drying or by particles from gas saturated solutions-drying (PGSS-drying). beta-Glucans were precipitated also by supercritical anti-solvent (SAS), but it was not a suitable drying process for this material. Particles were characterized regarding particle size, morphology, crystallinity, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro activity against B. cinerea. Although the emulsions with beta-glucans had bigger droplet size than the ones with lecithin, there was no difference on particle size for each encapsulating material, it was just dependent on the drying process. For all the materials and drying processes, completely amorphous particles were obtained, in spite of the crystalline form of the pure active compounds. Concerning the antifungal activity, the encapsulation of tebuconazole did not improve its action, because it was already very effective.

Nevertheless, little information exists on the availability of organoclay-formulated pesticides for bacterial degradation. In this work, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the adsorption-desorption behavior of two hexadecyltrimethylammonium-treated Arizona montmorillonites (SA-HDTMA(50) and SA-HDTMA(100)) for the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and to evaluate the ability of these organoclays, to slow the release of the herbicide and to reduce herbicide leaching losses as compared to the free (technical) compound. The kinetics of mineralization of free and formulated 2,4-D by adapted bacteria was also determined. Organoclay-based formulations of 2,4-D displayed slow release properties in water and reduced herbicide leaching through soil columns, while maintained a herbicidal efficacy similar to that of the free (technical) 2,4-D. The total amount of C-14-2,4-D mineralized at the end of the biodegradation experiment (t = 130h) ranged between 30% and 46% of the formulated herbicide, which represented 53-81% of the amount of free 2,4-D mineralized in the same conditions. The release, leaching, and mineralization patterns of the formulated herbicide were found to depend both on the affinity of the organoclay for the herbicide and on the degree of interaction promoted during the preparation of the herbicide-organoclay complex.

The latest research focuses on the active compounds of natural origin, inhibiting fungal growth, and preventing the formation of fungal biofilms. Antimicrobial peptides are currently the subject of numerous studies concerning effective antifungal therapy. In the present study, the antifungal properties of two synthetic peptides (Delta M3, Delta M4) derived from an insect antimicrobial peptide - cecropin D - were investigated. The fungicidal activity of both compounds was demonstrated against the yeast forms of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis, reaching a MFC99.9 in the micromolar range, while Candida glabrata showed greater resistance to these peptides. The scanning electron microscopy revealed a destabilization of the yeast cell walls upon treatment with both peptides; however, their effectiveness was strongly modified by the presence of salt or plasma in the yeast environment. The transition of C. albicans cells from yeast to filamentous form, as well as the formation of biofilms, was effectively reduced by Delta M4. Mature biofilm viability was inhibited by a higher concentration of this peptide and was accompanied by increased ROS production, activation of the GPX3 and SOD5 genes, and finally, increased membrane permeability. Furthermore, both peptides showed a synergistic effect with caspofungin in inhibiting the metabolic activity of C. albicans cells, and an additive effect was also observed for the mixtures of peptides with amphotericin B.

In previously-untreated soil, the half-life of carbofuran applied as the pure compound, the commercial microgranule formulation and the encapsulated formulation, was 8 weeks or more under standardized conditions (18-22 degrees C; 80% of the soil water retention capacity). The half-life of the carbofuran applied on seeds was only 2 weeks in this soil. In the previously-treated soil, the half-life of the pure active ingredient of carbofuran was < 2 weeks, but increased to > 3 weeks with some of the encapsulated formulations such as alginate-Fe3+ beads and alginate-Ca2+ beads co-formulated with the fungicide TMTD. There was some evidence that degradation occurred only after the active ingredient had diffused out of the beads. The persistence of furathiocarb and carbofuran applied on seeds was < 5 days for all the seed treatments tested in the previously-untreated soil. Encapsulated chemicals in alginate beads were more promising than seed treatment in increasing their persistence in soils showing accelerated degradation.

It is one of the main pests in protected pepper crops under glasshouse conditions in Southeastern Spain, but its control is limited as a consequence of the few available authorized insecticides and their incompatibility with the natural enemies. Some essential oils and pure compounds such as anise (Pimpinella anisum) or farnesol are repellent and/or toxic to aphids. Their use as a botanical insecticides can be an alternative for aphid control in pepper. RESULTS The effect of farnesol was evaluated against M. persicae in a new bioassay developed to test the contact effect (aqueous formulation of the products) on aphids in laboratory conditions. Aniseed essential oil, geraniol and (Z)-jasmone at 0.6% causes an aphid mortality of >50%; and farnesol was the most effective (93.67% mortality). Farnesol nanoemulsions between 0.2% and 0.6% were formulated with an IKA-Labor Pilot dispersing machine (7940 rpm for 10 min) using Tween 80 as a surfactant. These formulations were tested on field experiments (glasshouse conditions) on pepper crops for 2 years. Foliar applications of farnesol at a concentration of 0.4% in field conditions causes a high reduction in aphid populations, with efficacies of approximate to 70-80% with respect to the control, similar to or even higher than the efficacy of the reference pyrethrin insecticide. CONCLUSION Farnesol showed a great aphicidal effect against M. persicae. The use of this molecule in integrated pest management programs combined with natural enemies is a good option for future control of M. persicae.

Anthelmintic treatment is central to controlling these worms, but widespread resistance to most of the commercially available anthelmintics for veterinary and agricultural use is compromising control, such that there is an urgency to discover new and effective drugs. The purpose of this article is to review information on parasitic nematodes, the treatment and control of parasitic nematode infections and aspects of discovering new anthelmintics in the context of anthelmintic resistance problems, and then to discuss some progress that our group has made in identifying selected compounds with activity against nematodes. The focus of our recent work has been on discovering new chemical entities and known drugs with anthelmintic activities against Haemonchus contortus as well as other socioeconomically important parasitic nematodes for subsequent development. Using whole worm-based phenotypic assays, we have been screening compound collections obtained via product-development-partnerships and/or collaborators, and active compounds have been assessed for their potential as anthelmintic candidates. Following the screening of 15,333 chemicals from five distinct compound collections against H. contortus, we have discovered one new chemical entity (designated SN00797439), two human kinase inhibitors (SNS-032 and AG-1295), 14 tetrahydroquinoxaline analogues, one insecticide (tolfenpyrad) and two tolfenpyrad (pyrazole-5-carboxamide) derivatives (a-15 and a-17) with anthelmintic activity in vitro. Some of these 20 'hit' compounds have selectivity against H. contortus in vitro when compared to particular human cell lines. In our opinion, some of these compounds could represent starting points for 'lead' development. Accordingly, the next research steps to be pursued include: (i) chemical optimisation of representative chemicals via structure-activity relationship (SAR) evaluations; (ii) assessment of the breadth of spectrum of anthelmintic activity on a range of other parasitic nematodes, such as strongyloids, ascaridoids, enoplids and filarioids; (iii) detailed investigations of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) of optimised chemicals with broad nematocidal or nematostatic activity; and (iv) establishment of the modes of action of lead candidates.",2020,108,1,45,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.apar.2019.12.003

In this review, we discuss the reports that have examined Salvia species with the aim of isolation of pure compounds with different biological activities. The phytochemical analyses of various sage plants have reported 10 monoterpenoids (1-10), 1 sesquiterpenoid (11), 8 labdane (13-20), 15 ent-kaurane (21-35), 82 abietane, rearranged abietane and tanshinone (36-117), 3 icetexane (118-120), 43 clerodane (121-163), and 3 pimarane (164-166) diterpenoids with cytotoxic and antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antioxidant, phytotoxic and insecticide effects. The other heavier terpenoids, including 3 sesterterpenes (167-169), 10 triterpenoids and beta-sitosterol (170-180) have been introduced as minor bioactive compounds in the sage plants. Sahandinone (107), 6,7-dehydroroyleanone, 7-alpha-acetoxyroyleanone (40), and tanshinone like diterpenoids have been isolated from the roots' extracts of different Salvia species.

The composition of delta-endotoxins (Cry and Cyt proteins) in the parasporal crystal determines the toxicity profile of each Bt strain. However, a reliable method for their identification and quantification has not been available, due to the high sequence identity of the genes that encode the delta-endotoxins and the toxins themselves. Here, we have developed an accurate and reproducible mass spectrometry-based method (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-multiple reaction monitoring [LC-MS/MS-MRK) using isotopically labeled proteotypic peptides for each protein in a particular mixture to determine the relative proportion of each delta-endotoxin within the crystal. To validate the method, artificial mixtures containing Cry1Aa, Cry2Aa, and Cry6Aa were analyzed. Determination of the relative abundance of proteins (in molarity) with our method was in good agreement with the expected values. This method was then applied to the most common commercial Bt-based products, DiPel DF, XenTari GD, VectoBac 12S, and Novodor, in which between three and six delta-endotoxins were identified and quantified in each product. This novel approach is of great value for the characterization of Bt-based products, not only providing information on host range, but also for monitoring industrial crystal production and quality control and product registration for Bt-based insecticides. IMPORTANCE Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-based biological insecticides are used extensively to control insect pests and vectors of human diseases. Bt-based products provide greater specificity and biosafety than broad-spectrum synthetic insecticides. The biological activity of this bacterium resides in spores and crystals comprising complex mixtures of toxic proteins. We developed and validated a fast, accurate, and reproducible method for quantitative determination of the crystal components of Bt-based products. This method will find clear applications in the improvement of various aspects of the industrial production process of Bt. An important aspect of the production of Bt-based insecticides is its quality control. By specifically quantifying the relative proportion of each of the toxins that make up the crystal, our method represents the most consistent and repeatable evaluation procedure in the quality control of different batches produced in successive fermentations. This method can also contribute to the design of specific culture media and fermentation conditions that optimize Bt crystal composition across a range of Bt strains that target different pestiferous insects. Quantitative information on crystal composition should also prove valuable to phytosanitary product registration authorities that oversee the safety and efficacy of crop protection products.",2020,86,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00476-20

Ten days after treatment, the number of newly developed CBS lesions and pycnidia produced were evaluated using fifty fruits per treatment. The Dimy Pel (R) and Messenger (R) reduced the number of new developed CBS lesions on fruits in up to 67% and 62%, respectively. All applied treatments drastically decreased the number of pycnidia produced in the CBS lesions on orange fruits with 85% to 96% reductions compared to the untreated control. Volatile compounds produced by the isolates Bt- HD-567, Bt- Dimy and Bt- DiPel, reduced the number of lesions on treated fruits by 70%, 65% and 71% compared to the control, respectively.

Innovative formulations and packaging systems will have to make a major contribution for industry to reach these goals. In the last 10 years, much progress has been made in the design and development of new formulations and packaging options. In particular, by reduction of organic solvents in liquid formulations, the environmental impact and toxicity of products may be reduced. A reduction of dermal toxicity may be obtained by encapsulation of the active ingredient. Improved worker and environmental safety is also achieved by replacing powders with water dispersible granules which eliminates dusting during handling, or by packaging them in water soluble film, which offers a variety of advantages. Seed treatment provides an elegant way to minimize the amount of chemical needed by placing it directly at the spot where it is needed at the right time. In terms of packaging strategy, waste reduction and improved handling safety are prime objectives. Refillable container programs aimed at larger growers and custom applicators will contribute to the reduction of one-way packaging and associated secondary packaging. For smaller growers and also for the use of highly active compounds, the introduction of solid formulations and gels, which can be packaged in water soluble film, completes the strategy to achieve a reduction of packaging waste.

The dietary in take of steroid hormones (10 mu g/day progesterone, 0.1 mu g/day estrogens, and 0.05 mu g/day testosterone) is negligible compared to the human endogenous hormone synthesis. The second part addresses the phytoestrogens (isoflavones, coumestans, other bioflavonoids, lignans, phytosterols), which occur in food in much higher amounts than steroid hormones. Therefore, they can cause hormonal effects although their estrogen equivalents (relative to 17 beta-estradiol) are estimated to be 10(-2)-10(-4).

Increased dose dispersion reduced the proportion of larvae that were able to ingest the full dose, presumably because of feeding inhibition caused by ingestion of sublethal droplets. In addition, mortality of fully dosed larvae declined significantly with increasing dispersion, implying a reduction in the effectiveness of the ingested dose. When compared with operational spray deposits, our results suggest that efficacy of spruce budworm sprays may be improved by increasing the proportion of needles receiving a lethal spray deposit by increasing product potency and possibly the active ingredient application rate.",1995,127,15,23,http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/Ent12715-1

Controlled release (CR) polymer matrix systems offer a number of potential advantages over the conventional means of application. The principal advantage of the CR systems is that they allow much less active agent to be used for the desired period of activity. The design criteria of CR monolithic systems involving the selection of polymer type and other basic components of the formulation are discussed. The monolithic system functions on the principle of diffusion dissolution or membrane-moderated diffusional release mechanism. The release characteristics of the system can be altered by changing the composition, morphology or by use of additives to meet the specific product requirements.

Nanoemulsions as new approaches have attracted great attention in delivering many poorly soluble in water active compounds. In this study, the most widely used pyrethroid insecticides (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin) were formulated as nanoemulsions by high-energy ultrasonication. The droplet sizes of prepared nanoemulsions have been investigated by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), characterization result reveals the size of particles in the range 24.42-84.99 nm. Formulated nanoemulsions in comparison with the active ingredient (a.i) and emulsifier concentrate (EC) were evaluated against 4th instar larvae of S. littoralis. The in vivo activity levels of targeted enzymes, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) were studied in two bioassay methods (leaf dipping and topical application). Our finding showed that cypermethrin nanoemulsion has the highest activity with LC50 = 19.92 mg/l and LD50 = 2.11 ng/larva. Furthermore, the developed nano-formulation showed adequate toxicity levels on AChE and ATPase compared to the active ingredient and EC formulations. The protein-ligand docking was also studied, and the docking poses showed that the insecticides had an excellent binding affinity to the active site of the target enzymes. On this basis, these results suggest that oil in water (O/W) nanoemulsions would be beneficial and can be applied for delivery insecticide formulations.",2021,64,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/EJCHEM.2020.45275.2946

Sixteen sampling campaigns (non-monsoon, n = 9; monsoon n = 7) were organized to understand the seasonal variations with special emphasis on monsoon. We have found fifty-five OMPs in the monsoon; while forty-seven were detected in non-monsoon. Fifty-seven screened and quantified OMPs in the most polluted stretch of River Yamuna included the pharmaceutically active compounds, pes-ticides, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, phthalates, personal care products, fatty acids, food additives, hormones, and trace organics present in hospital wastes. During monsoon months, compounds for which concentrations exceeded 50 mu g/L were: adenine (64.6 mu g/L), diethyl phthalate (62.9 mu g/L), and octamethyltrisiloxane (56.9 mu g/L); and the same for non-monsoon months was only for 1-dodecanethiol (52.3 mu g/L). The average concentration of OMPs in non-monsoon months indicate PhACs>PCPs>Pesticides>Fatty acids>Hospital waste>Hormones>Pesticides>EDCs. In monsoon months due to surface runoff and high volume of untreated wastewater discharges few more OMPs concentrations were detected which mainly includes PhACs (clofibric acid, diclofenac sodium, gemfibrozil, ketoprofen), pesticides (aldrin, metribuzin, atrazine, simazine). Due to dilution effect in the monsoon months, average concentrations of 3-acetamido-5-bromobenzoic acid (PhACs) was reduced from 45.22 mu g/L to 14.07 mu g/L, whereas some EDCs such as 2,4-Di-tert-amylphenol, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, Triphenylphosphine oxide, Benzophenone were found in much higher concentrations in the monsoon months. Octamethyltrisiloxane (PCPs) was detected 50 times higher in concentration in the monsoon months.

In this study, a formula of the synergism index (SI*, Formula (3)) and the graphical method (Fig. 3) expressed by the diameters of inhibition zones were defined. (2-thiocyanoethyl)-cinnamate (A) and a commercial product of Isothiazoline whose active ingredients are the mixture 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (B) were chosen for combination, and the diameters of inhibition zones and minimum inhibitory concentrations for the effectiveness of different combinations to nine fungi were determined to verify the feasibility of the two methods. Results show that the values of SI calculated by MIC and the value of SI* calculated by diameters of inhibition zones are only slightly different, but they both show the same tendency in that, to most fungi and for most proportions, the values of SI and SI* are all less than 1.0. So, the different combinations of A and B show a synergistic effect or additive effect and the method of SP is viable to evaluate their action. The relation between the value of SI* and the type of action is same as that of SI. Regarding the graphical method, the results for MIC show a dramatic synergistic effect that is different from that of SI method, and the results of evaluation of diameters of inhibition zones is similar to that of SI* method. So the graphical method expressed by the diameters of inhibition zones is also usable.

The herbicide release rate in water showed that nanocomposites presented higher retentions than the neat samples (herbicide-loaded starch or MMT), revealing a cooperative or synergic effect between the constituents. Biodegradation essays also revealed this cooperative behavior, showing longer biodegradation periods for the nanocomposite than the pristine materials. Also, a two-step release was noticed, where the first step was controlled by starch (short periods) and the second was played by MMT (longer times). The nanocomposite structural analysis gave evidence that the release behavior is governed by the interaction between the constituents, even at very high herbicide contents.

Swingle, is a natural herbicide, whose use is limited by its low persistence and rapid degradation in organic substrates. Dextrin-based nanosponges (NSs) are polymers with a cage-like structure that can complex several molecules, acting as carriers or protectors. Their encapsulation efficiency can be exploited in numerous applications. Hence this study explored at first the biological activity of eight different dextrin-based NSs, synthesized with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) or pyromellitic dianhydride (PYRO) (?NS-CDI, ?NS-CDI, ?NS-CDI, LC NS-CDI, ?NS-PYRO, ?NS-PYRO, ?NS-PYRO, and LC NSPYRO), towards two model species (Lepidium sativum L. and Raphanus sativus L.) in filter paper under controlled conditions in laboratory. Then, the selected dextrin-based NSs were loaded with ailanthone and applied in the concentration of 7.5 or 30 mg L-1 of ailanthone in pre-emergence on the same species, initially on filter paper and subsequently on cultivation substrate for horticulture. In all three bioassays, the number of germinated seeds and the length of developed roots and hypocotyls were evaluated. In the first bioassay, the results showed that five dextrin-based NSs promoted the germination and root elongation, thus counteracting the herbicidal effect of ailanthone. Hence, three selected formulations (?NS-CDI, ?NS-CDI, and LC NS-CDI) were loaded with ailanthone, with ?NS-CDI providing the highest loading capacity (1.36%) and encapsulation efficiency (55.15%). In the second bioassay, the phytotoxic activity of ailanthone was strengthen by dextrin-based NSs, always stronger by at least 58% than the pure compound across 30 days in paper, without differences between formulations. In the third bioassay, loading ailanthone in ?NS-CDI also prolonged its herbicidal activity, still reducing to only 20% the germination and growth of garden cress and radish 30 and 20 days after treatment, respectively. Overall, results demonstrated that dextrin-based nanosponges can be proposed as suitable carriers in the formulation of ailanthone-based herbicide. Their use both increased and extended the phytotoxic activity of ailanthone, leading to the possibility of reducing the amount applied for each treatment, or reducing the number of herbicide treatments.",2021,164,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113346

The most potent strain, B. sphaericus 2362, which is the active ingredient in the commercial product VectoLex (R), together with another well-known larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis, is used to control vector and nuisance mosquito larvae in many regions of the world. Although not all strains of B. sphaericus are mosquitocidal, lethal strains produce one or two combinations of three different types of toxins. These are (1) the binary toxin (Bin) composed of two proteins of 42 kDa (BinA) and 51 kDa (BinB), which are synthesized during sporulation and co-crystallize, (2) the soluble mosquitocidal toxins (Mtx1, Mtx2 and Mtx3) produced during vegetative growth, and (3) the two-component crystal toxin (Cry48Aa1/Cry49Aa1). Non-mosquitocidal toxins are also produced by certain strains of B. sphaericus, for example sphaericolysin, a novel insecticidal protein toxic to cockroaches. Larvicides based on B. sphaericus-based have the advantage of longer persistence in treated habitats compared to B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. However, resistance is a much greater threat, and has already emerged at significant levels in field populations in China and Thailand treated with B. sphaericus. This likely occurred because toxicity depends principally on Bin rather than various combinations of crystal (Cry) and cytolytic (Cyt) toxins present in B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Here we review both the general characteristics of B. sphaericus, particularly as they relate to larvicidal isolates, and strategies or considerations for engineering more potent strains of this bacterium that contain built-in mechanisms that delay or overcome resistance to Bin in natural mosquito populations.

This compound previously exhibited antifungal activities towards several plant pathogenic fungi. Achieving clean and identified T. asperellum active ingredient(s) secreted product(s) is the first step in revealing their commercial potential as new fungicides. Follow-up studies should test this component against the LWD pathogen in potted sprouts and the field. Late wilt disease (LWD) is a destructive vascular disease of maize (Zea mays L.) caused by the fungus Magnaporthiopsis maydis. Restricting the disease, which is a significant threat to commercial production in Israel, Egypt, Spain, India, and other countries, is an urgent need. In the past three years, we scanned nine Trichoderma spp. isolates as biological control candidates against M. maydis. Three of these isolates showed promising results. In vitro assays, seedlings pathogenicity trials, and field experiments all support the bio-control potential of these isolates (or their secretions). Here, a dedicated effort led to the isolation and identification of an active ingredient in the growth medium of Trichoderma asperellum (P1) with antifungal activity against M. maydis. This Trichoderma species is an endophyte isolated from LWD-susceptible maize seeds. From the chloroform extract of this fungal medium, we isolated a powerful (approx. 400 mg/L) active ingredient capable of fully inhibiting M. maydis growth. Additional purification using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) separation steps enabled identifying the active ingredient as 6-Pentyl-alpha-pyrone. This compound is a potential fungicide with high efficiency against the LWD causal agent.",2021,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10090897

We determined the 50% lethal concentration (LC(50)) and 90% lethal concentration (LC(90)) of nootkatone by recording tick mortality 24 h after exposure in treated glass vials. Nymphs were susceptible to nootkatone with LC(50) values of 0.352, 0.233, 0.169, and 0.197 mu g/cm(2), and LC(90) values of 1.001, 0.644, 0.549, and 0.485 mu g/cm(2) for A. americanum, D. variabilis, I. scapularis, and R. sanguineus, respectively. The LC(50) value for R. sanquineus was not significantly different from D. variabilis or I. scapularis. Other LC(50) comparisons were significantly different. The LC(90) for A. americanum was higher when compared with the three other tick species, which were not significantly different. Because nootkatone is volatile, we measured the amount of nootkatone recovered from duplicate-treated vials before tick exposure and from vials after tick exposure. Nootkatone recovered from vials before exposure ranged from 82 to 112% of the expected amounts. The nootkatone recovered after the 24-h exposure period ranged from 89% from vials coated with higher concentrations of nootkatone, down to 29% from vials coated with low nootkatone concentrations. Determination of the nootkatone residue after vial coating demonstrated loss of the active compound while verifying the levels of tick exposure. Toxicity of low concentrations of nootkatone to the active questing stage of ticks reported in this study provides a reference point for future formulation research to exploit nootkatone as a safe and environment-friendly tick control.",2011,48,322,326,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME10148

However, methomyl induction of cytotoxicity through DNA damage is largely unknown. Here we identify cytotoxicity and potential genotoxicity of methomyl in vitro. We have employed alkaline comet assay, gamma H2AX foci formation and DNA ladder assay to detected DNA damage and apoptosis of Drosophila S2, HeLa and HEK293 cells. The alkaline comet assay was used to evaluate total DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) in the target cells exposed in vitro to sublethal concentrations of methomyl. As expected, methomyl induced significant concentration-dependent increases in DNA damage of target cells compared with the negative control, as measured by increases in tail length (urn), tail DNA (percentage of the comet tail) and tail moment (arbitrary units). In agreement with the comet assay data, the percentage of gamma H2AX positive reaction in HeLa cells also revealed methomyl caused DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, methomyl induced a significant increase of apoptosis in Drosophila 52, HeLa and HEK293 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as determined by Urea PAGE DNA fragmentation analysis. In conclusion, methomyl is a strongly genotoxic agent that induces cell DNA damage and apoptosis in vitro at these sublethal concentrations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

After the treatment of soil samples, effects on metabolic sum parameters were determined by monitoring substrate-induced respiration (SLR) and dehydrogenase activity, as well as carbon and nitrogen mineralization. These conventional ecotoxicological testing procedures are used in pesticide registration. inhibition of biomass-related activities and stimulation of nitrogen mineralization were the most significant effects caused by the application of Herbogil. Even though Goltix and Oleo were used at a higher dosage (10 times higher), the application of Goltix resulted in smaller effects and the additive Oleo was the least-active compound, with minor stimulation of test parameters at later observation times. The results sen ed as a background for investigation of the power of fingerprinting methods in microbial ecology. Changes in catabolic activities induced by treatments were analyzed by using the 95 carbon sources provided by the BIOLOG system. Variations in the complex metabolic fingerprints demonstrated inhibition of many catabolic pathways after the application of Herbogil. Again, the effects of the other compounds were expressed at much Ion er levels and comprised stimulations as well as inhibitions. Testing for significance by a multivariate t test indicated that the sensitivity of this method was similar to the sensitivities of the conventional testing procedures. The variation of sensitive carbon sources, as determined by factor weights at different observation times, indicated the dynamics of the community shift induced by the Herbogil treatment in more detail. DNA extractions from soil resulted in a collection of molecules representing the genetic composition of total bacterial communities. Distinct and highly reproducible community patterns, or genetic fingerprints, resulting from application of the different herbicides were obtained by the sequence-specific separation of partial 16S rDNA amplification products in temperature gradient gel electrophoresis. Significant pattern variations were quantified. For detailed analysis, application-responsive bands from the Herbogil and Oleo treatments were sequenced and their tentative phylogenetic positions were identified.

Industrial and mining activities represent the main sources of heavy metal contamination, which provide unique challenges for their remediation, as they cannot be degraded into innocuous products. On the other hand, extensive production and use of hydrocarbons and pesticides in diverse fields has resulted in widespread environmental contamination by these chemicals. A variety of remediation technologies that include physicochemical methods are available to address contamination with organic and inorganic pollutants. However, these technologies have high cost and the risk of secondary environmental pollution. The microbial remediation includes the use of certain microorganisms or products derived to them to address the problems of environmental pollution. In this connection, the synthesis and release of exopolymers with surfactants activity is one of the strategies of the first microbial cell defense line against diverse toxics. These compounds can be successfully used to release hydrocarbons and other pollutants of low solubility from soils matrix.

Thus, this study aimed to develop formulations from solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), or nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) associated with cypermethrin (cip) + chlorpyrifos (chlo) and vegetable compounds (citral, menthol, or limonene). Particles were then characterised, and their efficacy was verified on R. microplus in comparison to nanoformulations without the plant-based compounds. Six different formulations were developed and characterised by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Formulations 1 (SLN+cyp+chlo+citral), 2 (SLN+cyp+chlo+menthol), 3 (SLN+cyp+chlo+limonene), 4 (NLC+cyp+chlo+citral), 5 (NLC+cyp+chlo+menthol) and 6 (NLC+cyp+chlo+limonene) had mean diameters from 286 to 304 nm; polydispersion from 0.16 to 0.18; zeta potential from -15.8 to 20 mV, concentration from 3.37 +/- 0.24 x 10(13) to 5.44 +/- 0.18 x 10(13) particles/mL and encapsulation efficiency (EE) > 98.01 % for all active ingredients. All formulations were evaluated for their acaricidal potential by the larval packet test (LPT) and compared with nanoformulations without the plant-based compounds. Formulations were also compared with positive (Colosso (R) at 512 mu g/mL) and negative controls (distilled water and nanoparticles without active ingredients). The SLN (1, 2 and 3) and NLC (4, 5 and 6) formulations, at 7 mu g/mL, resulted in 90.4 %, 75.9 %, 93.8 %, 100 %, 95.1 % and 72.7 % mortality. The data demonstrated that the addition of citral, menthol or limonene in the formulations improved their acaricide action against tick larvae. Except for formulation 4, for which it was not possible to determine lethal concentrations (LC). Formulations, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 reached LC50 and LC90 values of 3.3 and 7.2, 5.4 and 9.2, 4.0 and 8.1, 2.3 and 5.4 as well as 5.5 and 9.4 mu g/mL, respectively. It was possible to encapsulate the active ingredients and characterise the lipid carrier systems. SLN and NLC protected the active ingredients against degradation in solution and increased the overall stability. A stabile solution is necessary for synthesizing commercial acaricidal products. It is hoped that these findings may contribute to new studies focused on the use of nanocarriers in tick formulations. By reducing the amount or concentration of active ingredients within commercial products, the risk of residues presents in food of animal origin or remaining in the environment is reduced. Nanocarriers help prevent these challenges, while still maintaining effective parasitic control. Utilizing a combination of natural and synthetic products can be part of integrated management solutions and can help overcome widespread acaricide resistance in populations of cattle ticks.",2022,309,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2022.109756

Aim of the review: The work reviews and analyses the traditional use, biological activities with the corresponding chemical constituents, and toxicological data on Rhododendron species. The review aims at characterizing the ethnopharmacology of the genus in relation to its toxicity in order to identify the therapeutic potential of Rhododendron species and future directions for research. Methods: Data regarding Rhododendron spp. was collected using electronic databases (SciFinder, PubMed, Google Scholar) and library search for selected peer-reviewed articles. Plant taxonomy was validated by the databases The Plant List, Tropicos, eFloras, Flora Iberica and Flora Europaea (RBGE). Additional information on traditional use and botany was obtained from published books. The review encompasses literature, mainly regarding biological activity and toxicological data, from 1898 to the end of December 2012. Results: Rhododendrons have been used in Asian, North American and European traditional medicine mainly against inflammation, pain, skin ailments, common cold and gastro-intestinal disorders. In vivo and in vitro testing of plant extracts and isolated compounds determined diverse biological activities including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, insecticidal and cytotoxic activity. Rhododendron spp. can cause intoxications in humans following intake of rhododendron honey or medicinal preparations. The toxicity is due to grayanotoxins, diterpenes which activate voltage-gated sodium channels and lead to gastrointestinal, cardiac and central nervous system symptoms. Conclusion: Rhododendron species are useful traditional remedies for the treatment of inflammation, pain, skin ailments, common cold and gastro-intestinal disorders. Pharmacological data has validated most indications of rhododendrons in ethnomedicine and toxicology studies have confirmed the toxicity observed by traditional use. Ethnopharmacological data point to the therapeutic potential of the genus Rhododendron for the treatment of inflammatory conditions and pain and, thus, research should focus on identification of active compounds and related mechanistic studies. Prolonged and high dose intake of traditional formulations containing rhododendrons should be avoided until more in depth toxicity studies become available. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

An HPLC-DAD method was adapted to simultaneously identify and quantify rimsulfuron and its metabolites, which was successfully validated by GC-MS analysis. In aqueous solutions, pure rimsulfuron was rapidly hydrolyzed into metabolite 1 (N-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)-N-(3-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-pyridinylurea)), which itself was transformed into the more stable metabolite 2 (N-((3-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-pyridinyl)-4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidineamine)), with half-life (t(1/2)) values of 2 and 2.5 days, respectively. Hydrolysis was instantaneous under alkaline conditions (pH = 10). In aqueous suspensions of the alluvial soil (pH = 8), formulated rimsulfuron had a half-life of 7 days, whereas that of metabolite 1 was similar to that in water (about 3.5 days). The degradation of the two major metabolites was also studied in soil suspensions with the pure compounds at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg 1(-1). The half-life of metabolite 1 ranged from 3.9 to 5 days, close to the previous values. Metabolite 2 was more persistent and its degradation is strongly dependent on the initial concentration (Co): half-life values ranged from 8.1 to 55 days at 2-10 mg 1(-1), respectively. These values are higher than those determined from the kinetics of metabolite 1 transformation into metabolite 2 (t(1/2) = 8-19 days). The ecotoxicity of the three chemicals was evaluated through their effect on Daphnia magna and Vibrio fischeri (Microtox (R) bioassay). No effect was observed on D. magna with 24 and 48 h acute toxicity tests. Similarly, no toxic effect was observed with the Microtox,5 test for the three chemicals in the range of concentrations tested that included the field application dose. Thus, being of low persistence and lacking acute toxicity, these chemicals present a low environmental risk.

Fusarium wilt of tomato is a serious fungal disease limiting tomato production worldwide. Recently, the newly isolated B. inaquosorum strain KR2-7 considerably suppressed Fusarium wilt of tomato plants. The present study was performed to perceive potential direct and indirect biocontrol mechanisms implemented by KR2-7 against this disease through genome and chemical analysis. The potential direct biocontrol mechanisms of KR2-7 were determined through the identification of genes involved in the synthesis of antibiotically active compounds suppressing tomato Fusarium wilt. Furthermore, the indirect mechanisms of this bacterium were perceived through recognizing genes that contributed to the resource acquisition or modulation of plant hormone levels. This is the first study that aimed at the modes of actions of B. inaquosorum against Fusarium wilt of tomatoes and the results strongly indicate that strain KR2-7 could be a good candidate for microbial biopesticide formulations to be used for biological control of plant diseases and plant growth promotion. Tomato Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), is a destructive disease that threatens the agricultural production of tomatoes. In the present study, the biocontrol potential of strain KR2-7 against Fol was investigated through integrated genome mining and chemical analysis. Strain KR2-7 was identified as B. inaquosorum based on phylogenetic analysis. Through the genome mining of strain KR2-7, we identified nine antifungal and antibacterial compound biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) including fengycin, surfactin and Bacillomycin F, bacillaene, macrolactin, sporulation killing factor (skf), subtilosin A, bacilysin, and bacillibactin. The corresponding compounds were confirmed through MALDI-TOF-MS chemical analysis. The gene/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion, and induced systemic resistance were also identified in the KR2-7 genome, and their related secondary metabolites were detected. In light of these results, the biocontrol potential of strain KR2-7 against tomato Fusarium wilt was identified.

Plants from the genus Tephrosia are rich in bioactive phytochemicals, particularly rotenoids which include rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin. Rotenoids have strong insecticidal activities against a wider range of pests. However, there has been no treatise thus far focusing on Tephrosia as insecticidal plants. This article is intended to review phytochemicals produced by selected species, their insecticidal activities, and the current status on the use of Tephrosia as botanical insecticidal plants for insect pest control. Synthetic insecticides are effective in controlling insect pests but can also harm nontarget organisms and the environment. During the last 40 years, there has been an increasing interest in alternative insecticides, particularly those derived from plants, commonly known as botanical insecticides. However, commercially available botanical insecticides remain limited. Rotenone is one of the earliest identified compounds and was used as fish poison and pest management. Due to its link with Parkinson disease, the use of rotenone was banned in many developed countries. Rotenone used to be isolated from Derris spp. and Lonchocarpus spp., and it can also be isolated from Tephrosia species. In this article, we present basic botanical information on selected Tephrosia species and their major compounds related to insecticidal activities and highlight the current use of extracts derived from some species, Tephrosia vogelii in particular, for control of insect pests in stored grains and crop production. The crude extracts contain multiple bioactive compounds, mainly rotenone, deguelin, rotenolone, and tephrosin, which act in either additive or synergistic fashion, resulting in effective control of insect pests. There are about 400 species in the genus Tephrosia, and species and even strains or variants vary greatly in these active compounds. We argue that a systematic evaluation of bioactive compounds in different species are needed, and species or strains with high insecticidal activities should be selected for use in the sustainable control of insect pests.",2020,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects11100721

The adult control methods through indoor residual spraying (IRS) and use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) continue to be widely used with some high measure of success. Larval control methods are also being used by a number of National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) with limited understanding of its contribution. Larval control might be needed in some areas to move from malaria control to elimination. This experimental study was conducted to assess the field effectiveness of winter larviciding on the larval stages of the mosquito in Botswana and Zimbabwe. Methods: Two villages were selected in each of the two countries, one as an intervention and the other as the control. Water bodies in the intervention villages were treated using the commercial product VectoBac (R) WG (Valent BioSciences Corporation, IL, USA) containing the active ingredient Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), a WHO recommended bio-larvicide, applied at a rate of 300 g per hectare. Random-effects Poisson regression was employed during data analysis to compare intervention with control sites with respect to larval counts. Results: The average marginal effect of larviciding on the mosquito larvae taking interaction with time (period) into account, was -1.94 (95% CI -2.42 to -1.46) with incidence rate ratio of 0.14, thus an 86% larval reduction attributable to the intervention for both countries combined. There was a 92% and 65% effect for Botswana and Zimbabwe respectively. The effect on the early larval and late stages was 77% (P < 0.001) and 91% (P < 0.001), respectively. Overall, intervention larval sampling points had five more larvae than the control at baseline and 26 less after 16 weeks. The effect on the different species also showed similar trends. Discussion/conclusion: Larval control using Bti showed a high effect on the population of the mosquito larvae. The reduction of the early and late larval stages can lead to reduced adult mosquito emergence and low adult mosquito densities. Larviciding can be used to control mosquito vector population by suppressing the larval stages thereby reducing adult emergence and malaria risk.",2016,15,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-016-1642-6

The present study is the first to report that thymol synergistically or additively enhances the activity of P. ribesioides extracts and isolated compounds against S. exigua larvae at sublethal doses. Results: Thymol was synergistic when are mixed with hexane extract; however, if the hexane extract level was higher (LD30) than the thymol level (LD10), the reaction was antagonistic. CH2Cl2 extract and thymol were more toxic than the extract or thymol alone, and EtOAc extract was synergized by thymol if the components were combined at similar levels (1:1 thymol:EtOAc extract at the LD10 or LD30). MeOH extract individually had moderate insecticidal activity, but all combinations with thymol were synergistic as binary mixtures. Isolated compounds, piperine, phenethyl cinnamamide and cinnamic acid represented synergistic, additive, and antagonistic action after combining with thymol (1:1 at the LD10 or LD30). Detoxification enzymes after exposure of insects to treatments showed isolated compounds + thymol could inhibit CE, GST and AChE reaction of S. exigua exceptional being piperine + thymol, which induced detoxification enzyme activity. Conclusion: The synergistic activity was extract- and dose-specific. The impact on detoxification enzymes was variable and dependent on the composition of the extract and the doses of extract and thymol used in a binary mixture. In this metabolic model, the major insect compound in an extract may become detoxified, whereas a minor compound will act unimpeded, showing a lower LD50 than acting alone. This model suggests that thymol synergizes with extract components differently, which could depend on the specific metabolites in the extract and the dose applied.

Following the ongoing highly controversial debate on this compound, its potential impact on non-target organisms is a fundamental scientific issue. In its pure compound form, glyphosate is known for its acidic properties. Methods: We exposed zebrafish (Dania rerio) embryos to concentrations between 10 mu M and 10 mM glyphosate in an unbuffered aqueous medium, as well as at pH 7, for 96 hours post fertilization (hpf). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of aqueous media in the range of pH 3 to 8, in comparison with 1 mM glyphosate treatment at the respective pH levels. Additionally, we exposed zebrafish to 7-deoxy-sedoheptulose (7dSh), another substance that interferes with the shikirnate pathway by a mechanism analogous to that of glyphosate, at a concentration of one mM. The observed endpoints included mortality, the hatching rate, developmental delays at 24 hpf, the heart rate at 48 hpf and the malformation rate at 96 hpf. LC10/50, EC10 and, if reasonable, EC50 values were determined for unbuffered glyphosate. Results: The results revealed high mortalities in all treatments associated with low pH, including high concentrations of unbuffered glyphosate (>500 p,M), low pH controls and glyphosate treatments with pH < 3.4. Sublethal endpoints like developmental delays and malformations occurred mainly at higher concentrations of unbuffered glyphosate. In contrast, effects on the hatching rate became particularly prominent in treatments at pH 7, showing that glyphosate significantly accelerates hatching compared with the control and 7dSh, even at the lowest tested concentration. Glyphosate also affected the heart rate, resulting in alterations both at pH 7 and, even more pronounced, in the unbuffered system. In higher concentrations, glyphosate tended to accelerate the heart rate in zebrafish embryos, again, when not masked by the decelerating influence of its low pH. At pH > 4, no mortality occurred, neither in the control nor in glyphosate treatments. At 1 mM, 7dSh did not induce any mortality, developmental delays or malformations; only slightly accelerated hatching and a decelerated heart rate were observed. Our results demonstrate that lethal impacts in zebrafish embryos can be attributed mainly to low pH, but we could also show a pH-independent effect of glyphosate on the development of zebrafish embryos on a sublethal level.",2019,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7094

Currently there are ecotoxicological data available for <1 %, thus, the European Union Commission's Scientific committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and Environment (CSTEE) recommended use of (Q)SAR models and precaution to prioritize further risk assessment of similar to4500 compounds and their adjuvants. We ranked 2986 different pharmaceutical compounds in 51 classes relative to hazard toward algae, daphnids, and fish using the EPIWIN program. This ranking cannot be used to acquit a compound based on predicted relative ranking. Modifying additives were the most toxic classes. Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, antiviral, anxiolytic sedatives hypnotics and antipsychotics, corticosteroid, and thyroid pharmaceuticals were the predicted most hazardous therapeutic classes. The overall relative order of susceptibility was estimated to be daphnids > fish > algae. Expert judgment is needed to assess specific hazards for classes like microbial resistance and antibiotics, sex hormones, and endocrine disruptors. As human health and the function of ecological systems are interconnected and subject to the precautionary principle, harmonization of evidence for correlation and causality of adverse effects seems sensible in an ethical and cost-effective context to facilitate substitution of hazardous compounds.

In the treatment of water for drinking purposes first of all pressure-driven membrane techniques are used. The choice of the suitable membrane process depends on the size of the removed contaminants and admixtures from the water. Desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater is often the way to obtaining drinking water. Significant improvements in technology and design of reverse osmosis, the availability of alternative energy sources, the possibility of pretreatment and applied materials have caused the process to become environmentally-friendly source of fresh water in many regions of the world, particularly in those where their sources are limited. Nanofiltration and to some extent the reverse osmosis are the methods of water softening, as well as to remove disinfection by-products precursors and micropollutants. To remove inorganic micro-pollutants (nitrate, fluoride ions, boron, arsenic as well as chromium and heavy metals), nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis and Donnan dialysis, and ultraflltration enhanced with polymers and surfactants as well as membrane bioreactors, have been successfully applied. Use microfiltration and ultrafiltration in the water purification processes, meet essentially the latest regulations, that dictate the need to more effectively remove turbidity and colloids (e.g., Fe and Mn) and micro-organisms in the treatment process based on conventional filtration. High pressure membrane processes (RO and NF) are an effective method for removal of soluble organic compounds (DOC) in the treatment of natural waters. Natural organic matter (NOM), anthropogenic organic pollutants and disinfection by-products, covering part of the NOM, and other micropollutants are typical examples of such compounds. To anthropogenic micropollutants found in waters count polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and surface-active substances as well as disinfection by-products and chemical oxidation used in the treatment of drinking water. In the processes volatile trihalomethanes (THM), and non-volatile compounds, mainly halogenacetic acids (HAA), are formed. In recent years special attention in natural waters is paid onto Pharmaceutical Active Compounds (PhACs) and Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) which have biological activity. ECDs include a wide range of micropollutants, namely xerioestrogens, among which are the chlorinated pesticides, phthalates, aklphenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, and the female sex hormone, synthetic pharmaceuticals (e.g., contraceptive components) and other chemicals and substances produced by man and put into the environment. Scarcity of water, environmental requirements and the simple logic of reusing water instead of discharging it are conditions, which call for increased use of membrane technology in a multitude of applications.",2011,35,164,184,http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2011.2435

Yet, copper can accumulate in the soil if the annual input exceeds annual uptake by plants, which can have a negative impact on soil fertility. Its use should thus be avoided or reduced. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a bark extract of Magnolia officinalis Rehder and Wilson to control three pathogens including Plasmopara viticola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Berl. & De Toni (causing grapevine downy mildew), Venturia inaequalis (Cooke) G. Winter (causing apple scab), and Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) De Bary (causing potato and tomato late blight) under controlled and field conditions, and to identify compounds responsible for the antifungal activity of the extract. Under controlled conditions, M. officinalis bark extract showed a mean efficacy of 97% (P. viticola) and 93% (V. inaequalis) at 1 mg mL(-1), and EC50 between 0.14 and 0.20 mg mL(-1). Efficacy against P. infestans was comparatively low (52% at 1 mg mL(-1)). Magnolol and honokiol were identified as the main active compounds, both with EC50 <= 0.08 mg mL(-1) against P. viticola and V. inaequalis. Under field conditions, preliminary formulations reached efficacies up to 71% at 1-2 mg plant extract mL(-1) against grapevine downy mildew, whereas activity against apple scab could not be confirmed. Magnolia officinalis is a promising candidate for the development of a sustainable plant protection product against grapevine downy mildew due to a combination of good efficacy, high availability of the raw material at affordable prices, reasonable extraction efficiency, and expected low human toxicity due to its longstanding use in traditional Chinese medicine.",2018,114,97,105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.08.011

OS-I 59 with the active ingredient (ai) Pyraflufen-ethyl (25 g/1) represents a new and low toxic alternative in desiccation of potatoes. The active compound Pyraflufen-ethyl was discovered by Nihon Nohyaku Co. Ltd. and belongs to the chemical group of phenylpyrazoles. It is well known as a substance of the wide family of PPO-inhibitors and also used in co-formulation with different herbicides for control of broadleaf weeds in cereals. Because of its mode of action and non-systemic properties Pyraflufen-ethyl has an excellent potential as a haulm desiccant. OS-159 has been tested in various trials over several years in potatoes with different dosages combined with methylated rape seed oil (2 l/ha) as an adjuvant. The addition of methylated vegetable oil highly improves the foliage wetting and also the herbicidal efficacy of Pyraflufen-ethyl. In all field trials OS-159/Oil showed a good to excellent efficacy in a splitted application with a total dose of 40 g ai/ha without any negative impact on tuber's quality. Additionally a low dose treatment with OS-159 (20 g ai/ ha) after flailing was successfully tested and describes a reasonable and economical option in haulm desiccation. The efficacy was fully comparable to the reference product which was used in the recommended rate of 1000 g ai/ha.

Sustainable agricultural practices highlight minimal application of insecticides at low concentration. Use of controlled release formulations (CRFs) of pesticides in which active compound is associated with inert materials has emerged as an appealing alternative. In this study, nanospheres of insecticide cartap hydrochloride were developed using chitosan (CS) in the presence of tripolyphosphate (TPP) as crosslinker with the help of ionic gelation method, for the delivery of cartap hydrochloride. The nanoformulations were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The FESEM images revealed that the size of chitosan tripolyphosphate (CS-TPP) nanospheres (nps) was in range of 117.01-185.27 nm, whereas cartap hydrochloride entrapped chitosan tripolyphosphate (C-CS-TPP) nanospheres had a size of 163.50-276.74 nm. FTIR results confirmed loading of cartap hydrochloride into chitosan tripolyphosphate nanospheres. The nanospheres showed encapsulation efficiency of 86.1% and were stable for 30 days at ambient temperature.

In recent years the potentially adverse effects of their use on human health and the environment has received increasing attention by the public and the competent authorities. In this context reliable pesticide risk indicators are pivotal to assess the potential risk associated with the use of pesticide. Several pesticide risk indicators, serving various purposes, have been developed over the years. Recently, a new pesticide risk indicator, the Pesticide Load (PL), was introduced in Denmark. The PL has replaced the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI) as the official pesticide risk indicator. The PL consists of three sub-indicators for human health, ecotoxicology and environmental fate, respectively. For each of the three sub-indicators a pesticide load (PL) is calculated and expressed as the PL per unit commercial product (kg, L or tablet). PL for human health (PLHH) is based on the risk phrases on the product label, while PL for ecotoxicology (PLEco) is calculated on basis of the LC/LD/EC50 values of the active ingredients for acute toxicity to mammals, birds, fish, daphnia, algae, aquatic plants, earthworms and bees and NOEC values for chronic toxicity to fish, daphnia and earthworms. PL for environmental fate (PLFATE) is calculated on basis of the half-life in soil (DT50), the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and the SCI-GROW index. PL does not consider the actual exposure, i.e. it reflects the relative risks associated with the use of pesticides. Besides using PL for monitoring the yearly trend in pesticide use and load, the PL was also used for setting up a new pesticide tax scheme and for setting quantitative reduction targets. In Denmark, it is now compulsory for farmers to upload their pesticide use data, i.e. the annual pesticide statistics and the calculation of the PL can be produced on basis of pesticide use data rather than sales data that may not reflect the actual use by farmers. Because pesticide use data is available for each farm, maps providing detailed information on pesticide use in different regions can be produced. From 2010/11 to 2013/14 only minor differences were observed in the PL and, overall, similar trends were observed for the PL and TFI. Significant geographical differences, which could be attributed to differences in crop rotations, were apparent when estimating PL for each of the four major groups of pesticides (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and plant growth regulators). The maps produced from the pesticide use data revealed significant variation in PL for ecotoxicological effects on aqueous organisms and bees as well as environmental parameters such as leaching potential. It is suggested to use the maps to identify 'hot spots' and design monitoring programmes or to launch initiatives that can reduce the PL. By linking information on mode of action to each commercial pesticide product it was also possible to obtain detailed information on the use pattern of the various pesticide modes of action, which is relevant information assessing the risk of evolution of pesticide resistance.",2018,70,384,393,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.010

Cipres (Pilgerodendron uviferum), tepa (Laureliopsis philippiana), canelo (Drimys winteri), and paramela (Adesmia boronioides) EOs were extracted through steam distillation, and their compositions were analyzed through GC-MS analysis. EO contact toxicity against Musca domestica L., Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say was then evaluated. As a general trend, EOs performed better on housefly males over females. Cipres EO showed the highest insecticidal efficacy. The LD50(90) values were 68.6 (183.7) and 11.3 (75.1) mu g adult(-1) on housefly females and males, respectively. All EOs were effective against S. littoralis larvae; LD50 values were 33.2-66.7 mu g larva(-1), and tepa EO was the most effective in terms of LD90 (i.e., <100 mu g larva(-1)). Canelo, tepa, and paramela EOs were highly effective on C. quinquefasciatus larvae, with LC50 values < 100 mu L L-1. Again, tepa EO achieved LD90 < 100 mu L L-1. This EO was characterized by safrole (43.1%), linalool (27.9%), and methyl eugenol (6.9%) as major constituents.

For susceptible cultivars, the disease is often managed by frequent applications of fungicides to reduce yield loss. The use of bio-based compounds that interfere with biologically active systems is an innovative strategy for improving disease management. In the present work, the control of P. infestans infection on potatoes by potassium phosphite (KPhi) combined with recommended and reduced doses of active ingredients (Ais) from different fungicides was evaluated. The protective effects of different combinations were initially assessed in vivo and subsequently compared with a greenhouse screening. The active ingredients cyazofamid (CFD) and mancozeb (MCB), used at recommended and reduced doses, were less effective at reducing P. infestans infections than when combined with KPhi. In greenhouse trials, CFD, mandipropamid (MPD) and MCB at recommended doses were the most effective treatments when combined with KPhi; meanwhile, the combination of KPhi with azoxystrobin (AZ), benthiavalicarb-isopropyl/mancozeb (ISO/MCB), and CFD at reduced doses exhibited strong protective activity compared to other similar combinations. This decreased the severity of infection by P. infestans up to similar to 89%. Greenhouse experiments also demonstrated that a combination of KPhi and CFD at both doses caused the highest reduction in disease severity (up to similar to 90%) within 35 days of infection. In microplot experiments, KPhi delayed the progression of late blight in susceptible potato varieties; therefore, in the combined treatments AUDPC values were significantly lower than those obtained after applications with CFD doses, providing sufficient protection against late blight. Our data suggest that optimizing the formulation with addition of KPhi could result in a lower recommended dose. This would result in a reduction of the active compounds of the fungicides in potato farming. Furthermore, the impact of KPhi on late blight development makes it a potential component for incorporation into an integrated pest management system.",2022,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12020189

They are the main constituent of most products containing synthetic surfactants. The linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), alkyl ethoxysulfates (AES) and alkyl sulfates (AS) are typically applied from this class of compounds. Those surfactants are ingredients of household detergents and cleaners, laundry detergents, cosmetic etc. Moreover they can be applied in the paper, textile and tanning industry as optical brighteners, dispersant, wetting and suspending agents. They can be substrates in the formulation of different products like dyes, pigments, pesticides, exchange resins, plasticizers and pharmaceuticals. Anionic surfactants after use are passed into sewage-treatment plants, where they are partially degraded and adsorbed to sewage sludge (applied in agriculture fields). Finally, the anionic SAA or their degradation products are discharged into surface waters and onto bottom sediments, soils or living organisms. Therefore, it is important (widely application, bioaccumulation, toxicity for living organisms) to investigate the environmental fate of those class of compounds in more details. This research involves determination the concentration of anionic surfactants with use appropriated analytical techniques in environmental samples The official methodology for determination of anionic SAA in liquid samples is based on the ion-pair reaction of these analytes compounds with methylene blue (MB) and an extraction with toxic solvent chloroform. During isolation step of anionic compounds from solid samples are employed Soxhlet and ultrasonic-assisted extraction techniques with use of methanol or mixture of other organic solvents as extraction medium. To overcome disadvantages of those traditional techniques were applied following techniques at sample preparation step from liquid and solid matrices: solid-phase extraction (SPE) and solid-phases microextraction (SPME); accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), respectively. For estimate total concentration of anionic analytes in extracts the spectrophotometric technique is used (as official regulation).

Biological active agents are so diverse that applying the same safety standards to all of them is almost impossible. A comparative review of risk assessment processes of Nigeria's biopesticide regulations with other developing African countries (South Africa and Kenya) and developed regions (the European Union and the United States of America) was conducted. Prolonged field testing, lack of bridged risk assessments, and technical checklists were identified as key factors hampering the research and development of biopesticides in Nigeria. Suitable amendments to the existing regulations guiding biopesticide formulation and utilisation in Nigeria are recommended. Risk assessment matrices for microbial and biochemical pesticides and a scientific/technical checklist have also been developed.

Supporters of the broad use of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) claim they are innocuous to humans, since the active compound acts on the inhibition of enzymes which are absent in human cells. However, the neurotoxic effects of GBH have already been shown in many animal models. Further, these formulations were shown to disrupt the microbiome of different species. Here, we investigated the effects of a lifelong exposure to low doses of the GBH-RUp on the gut environment, including morphological and microbiome changes. We also aimed to determine whether exposure to GBH-RUp could harm the developing brain and lead to behavioral changes in adult mice. To this end, animals were exposed to GBH-RUp in drinking water from pregnancy to adulthood. GBH-RUp-exposed mice had no changes in cognitive function, but developed impaired social behavior and increased repetitive behavior. GBH-Rup-exposed mice also showed an activation of phagocytic cells (Iba-1-positive) in the cortical brain tissue. GBH-RUp exposure caused increased mucus production and the infiltration of plama cells (CD138-positive), with a reduction in phagocytic cells. Long-term exposure to GBH-RUp also induced changes in intestinal integrity, as demonstrated by the altered expression of tight junction effector proteins (ZO-1 and ZO-2) and a change in the distribution of syndecan-1 proteoglycan. The herbicide also led to changes in the gut microbiome composition, which is also crucial for the establishment of the intestinal barrier. Altogether, our findings suggest that long-term GBH-RUp exposure leads to morphological and functional changes in the gut, which correlate with behavioral changes that are similar to those observed in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.",2022,23,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms23105583

The (2E)-alkenals inhibited glucose-induced acidification by inhibiting the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. The primary antifungal action of medium-chain (C-9-C-12) (2E)-alkenals against S. cerevisiae comes from their ability to function as nonionic surface-active agents (surfactants), disrupting the native membrane-associated function nonspecifically.

These chemicals are present in porous media as consequence of wastewater reuse and sludge application from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP, Jerez de la Frontera) for the irrigation of crops. Soil samples were extracted from several sampling points up to 2 m depth and physicochemical, mineralogical and hydraulic properties were determined in the laboratory. Emerging contaminants were analyzed by two different analytical procedures based on the use of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE), followed by later quantification by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Synthetic surfactants were found in all soil samples, showing a wide range of concentrations: between 73 and 1300 mu g/kg for linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), from 329 to 1090 mu g/kg for alcohol polyethoxylates (AEOs) and between 155 and 279 pg/kg for nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs). The presence of LAS and AEOs homologues with longer alkyl chain was predominant due to their greater hydrophobicity. Over 60 pharmaceutical compounds belonging to various therapeutic groups (analgesics, antihypertensives, lipid regulators, psychiatric drugs, antibiotics, etc.) were also analyzed. Only 7 detected occasionally (diclofenac, metoprolol, fenofibrate, carbamazepine, clarithromycin, famotidine and hydrochlorothiazide) at very low concentrations (from 0.1 to 1.3 mu g/kg).",2013,NA,NA,NA,NA

Groups of reproductively mature fathead minnows were exposed for 28 d to 0.00 ppm, 0.05 ppm, 0.50 ppm, and 2.00 ppm 2,4-D (target) in a flow-through system. Weedestroy(R) AM40 significantly (p <= 0.05) depressed male tubercle presence and significantly increased female gonadosomatic index, and there were statistical trends (0.05 <= p <= 0.10) for effects on fecundity and hepatic vitellogenin mRNA expression in females and males. The herbicide DMA(R) 4 IVM also significantly depressed male tubercle presence. Gonads of females exposed to DMA 4 IVM exhibited significantly depressed stage of oocyte maturation, significantly increased severity of oocyte atresia, and a significant presence of an unidentified tissue type. Also, DMA 4 IVM significantly decreased larval survival. It had no impact on hepatic vitellogenin mRNA expression or gonadosomatic index. No significant effects on fertilization, hatchability, or embryonic development were observed in either trial. The formulations tested exhibited different toxicological profiles from pure 2,4-D. These data suggest that the formulations have the potential for endocrine disruption and can exert some degree of chronic toxicity. The present use of 2,4-D formulations in lake management practices and their permitting based on the toxicological profile of 2,4-D pure compound should be reconsidered.

Strategies are sought to reduce the toxicity of this fungicide and alternative treatments are welcome. An alternative could be the use of clove oil, which has Eugenol as its major compound, and has antifungal potential against G. cingulata, however, Eugenol is susceptible to degradation processes which may compromise its efficacy. The nanoencapsulation of Mancozeb and Eugenol is a possible strategy to overcome the limitations of toxicity, solubility and instability of these compounds. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop nanoemulsions containing Mancozeb (0.1 mg/mL) and Eugenol (33 mg/mL), isolated or associated, and evaluate the safety of these formulations through cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and ecotoxicity tests. Nanoemulsions were developed by the spontaneous emulsification method, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in healthy human cells through MTT, Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and Picogreen tests, and ecotoxicity assessment was carried out using the chronic toxicity test in springtails. After preparation, the physicochemical characterization of the nanoemulsions were performed which presented mean particle size between 200 and 300 nm, polydispersity index less than 0.3, negative zeta potential and acid pH. The nanoencapsulation was able to avoid the reduction of the cell viability caused by Mancozeb, while Eugenol was shown to be safe for cell use in both free and nanostructured forms, however the association of the two active compounds showed toxicity in the higher doses of Mancozeb. In the ecotoxicity tests, both free Mancozeb and Eugenol forms presented high toxic potential for soil, whereas the nanoencapsulation of these compounds did not cause a reduction in number of springtails.

The search for alternative insect pest control is becoming increasingly important and is including the use of plant-derived pesticides. Plant-derived pesticides are reported as effective in controlling various insect pests through natural mechanisms, with biodegradable organic materials, diverse bioactivity, and low toxicity to non-target organisms. An antifeedant approach for insect control in crop management has been comprehensively studied by many researchers, though it has only been restricted to plantbased compounds and to the laboratory level at least. Nano-delivery formulations of biopesticides offer a wide variety of benefits, including increased effectiveness and efficiency (well-dispersion, wettability, and target delivery) with the improved properties of the antifeedant. This review paper evaluates the role of the nano-delivery system in antifeedant obtained from various plant extracts. The evaluation includes the research progress of antifeedant-based nano-delivery systems and the bioactivity performances of different types of nano-carrier formulations against various insect pests. An antifeedant nano-delivery system can increase their bioactivities, such as increasing sublethal bioactivity or reducing toxicity levels in both crude extracts/essential oils (EOs) and pure compounds. However, the plant-based antifeedant requires nanotechnological development to improve the nanodelivery systems regarding properties related to the bioactive functionality and the target site of insect pests. It is highlighted that the formulation of plant extracts creates a forthcoming insight for a field-scale application of this nano-delivery antifeedant due to the possible economic production process.",2022,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nano12040630

These emulsions contain as the oil phase different blends of two isomeric essential oil compounds, thymol and carvacrol. The results show that the addition of carvacrol facilitates the dispersion of the oil within the aqueous phase, with the stabilization and polydispersity of the emulsions being controlled by the change of the ratio between the copolymer concentration and that of the oil phase (Rcop/EOC). Emulsions containing pure essential oil compounds as the oil phase do not present any significant difference on their larvicidal activity against mosquito larvae, with emulsions containing only thymol being slightly more effective than those containing only carvacrol as the oil phase. Furthermore, the use of blends containing different weight fractions of thymol and carvacrol as the oil phase results in formulations with an additive larvicidal activity in relation to those with the pure compounds. Despite the larvicidal activity of the emulsions, they do not provoke inhibition to the emergence of adult individuals in A. aegypti populations. The spreading and evaporation of the emulsions onto the solid surface, which may be an important parameter for the performance of larvicidal formulations, were found to be dependent on the same parameters that govern the stability of the emulsions.

An integrated, multidisciplinary team of scientific and clinical investigators is required in order to develop high quality phytomedicines and rigorously evaluate their safety and efficacy. Research on botanicals involves unique challenges as plant source materials frequently vary in chemical content and may contain unwanted pesticides, heavy metals, contaminant plant species, or other adulterants. Ideally, a botanical formulation should be standardized, both chemically and biologically, by a combination of analytical techniques and bioassays. This combination approach provides multiple measures by which reproducible quality and efficacy of botanical supplements may be achieved, and is particularly useful for botanical products for which the active compound(s) have not yet been identified. Safety and toxicity should be evaluated during the supplement development process in both in vitro and in vivo systems. A number of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods can aid in the assessment of purity, bioavailability, toxicity, metabolism, and molecular target profiling of botanical extracts. Clinical investigators must appreciate the complexity of multi-component phytomedicines and adjust trial protocols accordingly.

The pyrethroids that were tested reflect a diversity of structures, including six with an alpha-cyano phenoxybenzyl moiety (beta-cyfluthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and fenpropathrin) and six without this moiety (bifenthrin, S-bioallethrin, permethrin, pyrethrins, resmethrin and tefluthrin). These chemicals also present a variety of behavioral effects, including ones that are historically classified as causing a T (tremor), CS (choreoathetosis with salivation) or intermediate syndrome of intoxication, and others that have not previously been classified. Each pyrethroid that was tested consisted of the complement of isomers that occur in commercial products-a key factor for relevance for environmental and human exposure and for comparisons, since the biological activity of the individual isomers can vary tremendously. Young-adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (10 per dose group) were administered a single dose of pyrethroid by oral gavage, in corn oil, at a volume of 5 ml/kg. Each was tested at a range of two or three dose levels, including a minimally toxic dose, to establish the more sensitive manifestations of toxicity, and a more toxic dose, to establish a more complete spectrum of neurobehavioral manifestations. Animals were evaluated using a functional observational battery (FOB) that was designed to characterize and distinguish effects classically associated with T or CS syndromes of intoxication. The FOB was performed when manifestations of toxicity were most apparent at the time of peak effect (2, 4, or 8 h post-dosing) by observers who were blinded to dose group assignment, thus avoiding possible bias. The results from this study indicate that some pyrethroids clearly exhibit the historic classification symptoms of the T and CS syndromes while others do so less obviously. Use of the statistical technique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further helped interpret the study findings, as described in the accompanying paper (Breckenridge et al., 2009). These results establish manifestations of neurotoxicity in vivo that can be used as weight of evidence to determine whether pyrethroid insecticides act through a common mechanism of toxicity in mammals. Based on a review of the FOB data, analyzed by PCA, and other published data, two common mechanism groups are proposed. Group 1 would include pyrethrins, bifenthrin, resmethrin, permethrin, S-bioallethrin and tefluthrin. Group 2 would include cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, beta-cyfluthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin. Fenpropathrin exhibited features of both groups. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This is a modem and timely challenge in parasitology, aimed to reduce the frequent overuse of synthetic pesticides boosting resistance development in mosquitoes and causing serious threats to human health and environment. This review covers the huge amount of literature available on plant extracts tested as mosquito larvicides, particularly aqueous and alcoholic ones, due to their easy formulation in water without using surfactants. We analysed results obtained on more than 400 plant species, outlining that 29 of them have outstanding larvicidal activity (i.e., LC50 values below 10 ppm) against major vectors belonging to the genera Anopheles, Aedes and Culex, among others. Furthermore, synergistic and antagonistic effects between plant extracts and conventional pesticides, as well as among selected plant extracts are discussed. The efficacy of pure compounds isolated from the most effective plant extracts and when available their mechanism of action, as well as the impact on non-target species, is also covered. These belong to the following class of secondary metabolites: alkaloids, alkamides, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, sterols, flavonoids, coumarins, anthraquinones, xanthones, acetogenonins and aliphatics. Their mode of action on mosquito larvae ranges from neurotoxic effects to inhibition of detoxificant enzymes and larval development and/or midugut damages. In the final section, current drawbacks as well as key challenges for future research, including technologies to synergize efficacy and improve stability - thus field performances - of the selected plant extracts, are outlined. Unfortunately, despite the huge amount of laboratory evidences about their efficacy, only a limited number of studies was aimed to validate their efficacy in the field, nor the epidemiological impact potentially arising from these vector control operations has been assessed. This strongly limits the development of commercial mosquito larvicides of botanical origin, at variance with plant-borne products developed in the latest decades to kill or repel other key arthropod species of medical and veterinary importance (e.g., ticks and lice), as well as mosquito adults.

The continuously growing use of these various products means that water soluble detergents have become one of the most problematic groups of pollutants for the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Thus it is important to identify bacteria having the ability to survive in the presence of large quantities of detergent and efficiently decompose it to non-surface active compounds. In this study, we used peaty soil sampled from a surface flow constructed wetland in a wastewater treatment plant to isolate bacteria that degrade sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We identified and initially characterized 36 Pseudomonas spp. strains that varied significantly in their ability to use SDS as their sole carbon source. Five isolates having the closest taxonomic relationship to the Pseudomonas jessenii subgroup appeared to be the most efficient SDS degraders, decomposing from 80 to 100% of the SDS present in an initial concentration 1 g/L in less than 24 h. These isolates exhibited significant differences in degree of SDS degradation, their resistance to high detergent concentration (ranging from 2.5 g/L up to 10 g/L or higher), and in chemotaxis toward SDS on a plate test. Mass spectrometry revealed several SDS degradation products, 1-dodecanol being dominant; however, traces of dodecanal, 2-dodecanol, and 3-dodecanol were also observed, but no dodecanoic acid. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zymography revealed that all of the selected isolates possessed alkylsulfatase-like activity. Three isolates, AP3_10, AP3_20, and AP3_22, showed a single band on native PAGE zymography, that could be the result of alkylsulfatase activity, whereas for isolates AP3_16 and AP3_19 two bands were observed. Moreover, the AP3_22 strain exhibited a band in presence of both glucose and SDS, whereas in other isolates, the band was visible solely in presence of detergent in the culture medium. This suggests that these microorganisms isolated from peaty soil exhibit exceptional capabilities to survive in, and break down SDS, and they should be considered as a valuable source of biotechnological tools for future bioremediation and industrial applications.",2017,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01872

The results demonstrated NaLS with a larger M-w or lower Q(s) had higher surface activity. Conversely, the wettability of the NaLS aqueous solution toward difenoconazole powder showed a reverse trend, i.e., NaLS with a smaller M-w or higher Q(s) improved the wettability to difenoconazole. The surface activity and wettability was controlled by the varying densities of the NaLS molecules at the water to air interface or the solid/liquid interface, which was dependent on the molecular structure of NaLS.",2014,9,7119,7127,NA

Eleven of the cases resulted in fatalities, all among those attempting suicide. The average amount ingested by survivors was 120 +/- 112 mL and by nonsurvivors was 263 +/- 100 mL (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.0001). The average age of survivors was 35 +/- 15 years compared to 54 +/- 11 years for fatalities (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.0002). Irritation of the oral mucous membrane and gastrointestinal tract was the most frequently reported effect. Other effects recorded were pulmonary dysfunction, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, leukocytosis and fever. Fourteen patients received either atropine or pralidoxime plus atropine despite the fact that glyphosate does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase. Thirteen percent of patients received a urine test for paraquat or treatment customarily used for paraquat ingestion, possibly reflecting similar initial presentations following ingestion of these two herbicides.

The analysis and relative information collected regards a medium industry located in the south of Marche region (Italy) and the whole production system, from field to industry, is in a range of about 100 km between Marche and Abruzzo regions. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of 1 kg of frozen green bean for two different cultivation protocols for herbicides and pesticides application in order to assess the possible advantages due to shifting to different field treatments. The baseline scenario (A) considers the application of two herbicides (Pendimethalin and Linuron) and two pesticides (Altacor and Azoxystrobin), the alternative scenario (B) considers one herbicides application (Clomazone) and two pesticides (Emamectine and Azoxystrobin). The analysis has been conducted following ISO 14040 and 14044 on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Product Category Rules for arable crops v. 2.0. LCI (Life Cycle Inventory) and LCIA (Life Cycle Impact Assessment) phase have been performed using LCA software SimaPro (R) v. 8.2.3.0 with updated databases. The most used databases for this study are Ecoinvent 3 and Agri-footprint, LCI data have been collected through interviews, consulting official documents and company management programs. The system boundaries considered includes crop production, transport to industry plant and industry processing and all the data are referred to 2014 crop season. Crop production LCI considers seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, field activities, yield and relative emissions. Transportations covers distances and payload with empty return. Industry phase considers transformation efficiency, energy, fuels, water. The function of the production chain is to provide frozen green bean, no coproduct or by-product were produced. Residues and product losses from industry processing are managed by anaerobic digestion as waste. Plastics and other wastes from field and industry has been treated by landfill. Data regarding field phase were collected by interviews and consulting official management documents from 43 farms. Data regarding industrial phase have been gathered from automated management systems hardware/software AS/400 (IBM). The LCIA results for 1 kg of frozen green been show an impact of about 0.7 kg of CO2 eq for GWP, 1.9E-4 kg of C2H4 eq kg for PCOP, 3.5E-3 kg of SO2 eq for AP and 1.7E-3 kg of PO43- for EP. The analysis conducted comparing two different solutions of plant protection and herbicides application shows how solution A has a lower impact on ADP, ADP fossil, GWP 100yr, ODP, MEP, PCOP, AP and EP from 0.04% to 11% about. On the other hand, solution B has a lower impact on HTP, FEP, MEP and TEP between 4 and 40%. The analysis conducted shows the impact of frozen green been at industry level representative of medium size processing plant with average technology. The only information available in literature are limited to open field production impact assessment of raw green bean without any kind of industry transformation. . Simply replacing herbicide treatment and one pesticide application, for preventing weed and pest resistance, there is a consistent reduction of impact on different categories for ecotoxicity group without increasing too much the impact on other categories considered. The only exception can be found for ADP category in which the impact of alternative scenario (B) is higher than baseline (A). The reason lies in the lower active ingredient concentration and higher amount of commercial product used for solution B. From the analysis remains evident the contribution on ADP fossil, GWP and ODP due to energy used in industrial phase. On the other side field phase contributes more on ADP, HTP, FEP, AP and EP.

Nevertheless, they are still vital components of agricultural industry since no other competitive equivalents to chemical pesticides still exist in terms of efficiency. This study describes the preparation and biological assessment of an insecticide releasing plastic film for agricultural covering purposes. The formulation was prepared by incorporation of deltamethrin loaded, nano-sized halloysite nanotubes into polymeric films. Thermal, morphological, and mechanical properties of films were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Universal Testing Machine UTM. Sustained release profiles of the films were evaluated by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Results reveal that deltamethrin was successfully loaded into halloysite nanotubes and nanotube incorporation enhances the elastic modulus of linear-low density polyethylene (LLDPE) films. In addition, films exhibit sustained release function of the active agent for 60 days. Bioassays of the nanocomposite films with varying deltamethrin doses tested on grasshoppers showed that the LD(50 )values of the films are 1.85x10(-5) g/cm(2).

These MFCs are little influenced by pH values. A time-kill curve study indicates that nonyl gallate exhibits fungicidal activity against S. cerevisiae, at any growing stage. The antifungal activity of nonyl gallate is due primarily to its ability to act as a nonionic surface-active agent (surfactant).

Chemical control has been a successful method of preventing termite attack, but the effects of these chemicals are of concern as they create problems for our health and the environment. Biological methods could be suitable alternatives in this regard. The present paper reviews the various methods (physical, chemical, and biological) for termite control. Recent advances and past research done on termite control emphasizing biological methods are reviewed. Biological methods described include botanicals (essential oil, seed, bark, leaf, fruit, root, wood, resin), as well as fungal, bacterial, and nematode approaches. The relationship between chemical structure of active components responsible for termite control and termiticidal activity is discussed. The plants reviewed show good insecticidal properties against termites. These botanicals can be used for termite control singly and in combination.

Treatment efficiency is assessed using macroscopic and microscopic approaches to investigate spray retention. With the macroscopic approach, aspects related to spray coarseness, carrier volume, leaf wettability, plant architecture, crop density and additives are addressed. Comparative studies have highlighted the wide variability in spray retention as a function of these parameters. They have failed, however, to describe the underlying physical relationships clearly enough to generalize the results. These relationships are better investigated using a microscopic approach, where drop impact behavior is established in relation to target surface and fluid properties. The wetting regime (either Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter) depends on the leaf surface microscopic roughness ratio (r) and chemical nature, fluid dynamic surface tension and drop impact energy. Adhesion, rebound and disintegration have been observed successively with increasing drop impact energy. Transitions between impact outcomes are influenced by fluid rheology and the dynamic surface tension of the fluid. The effect of surface orientation remains poorly explored, but it seems to have a limited influence on retention. Recent fundamental studies on superhydrophobicity and wetting should help practitioners in their search for an ever more rational application of agrochemicals.

The antimould nanocarriers were based on commercially available polyacrylic copolymeric nanogel. The antimould agents were loaded into the nanogel particles in their swollen state in alkaline media followed by collapsing of the nanogel particles at acidic pH. We treated Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum cultures at different concentrations of the nanocarrier-loaded antimould agent. The effect of the surface charge of the antimould agent-loaded nanocarriers was examined in order to gain better understanding of how the electrostatic interaction of the nanocarrier with the cell walls of the mould hyphae and spores impacts its antimould action. Non-coated nanocarriers proved more efficient than PDAC-coated ones in their antimould action for both Ziram and IPBC formulations. Four different methods of application of the antimould nanocarriers were also explored. We found that the application method of the nanogel carrier is crucial for its efficiency and sustained antimould delivery. Pre-mixing the nanogel-formulated Ziram or IPBC with culture media generally produced much better antimould action. Such a strategy can potentially bypass this antimould resistance and lead to novel formulations with highly sustained antimould activity at similar concentrations of the antimould agent.

Traditional extraction techniques (LLE - for liquid samples; SLE - for solid samples) are time and solvent-consuming. Developments in this field result in improving isolation efficiency and decreasing solvent consumption (eg SPE and SPME - liquid samples or PLE, SFE and MAE - solid samples). At final determination step can be applied spectrophotometric technique, potentiometric titrametration or tensammetry (determination total concentration of non-ionic surfactants) or chromatographic techniques coupled with appropriated detection techniques (individual analytes).

Due to the favorable octanol-water partition coefficient and utilization of biodegradable cations of natural origin, synthesized esterquats can be considered promising alternatives to currently applied dicamba-based formulations. In addition, the obtained results allowed us to verify whether the organic cations in quaternary ammonium salts containing herbicidally active anions (such as dicamba) play the role of biologically inactive adjuvants that only enhance the efficiency of the active ingredient or if they simultaneously exhibit a significant degree of phytotoxicity. Analysis of the influence of alkyl betainate esterquats containing nonherbicidal (bromide) anions on seedlings of white mustard revealed that alkyl betainate cations promote the germination of white mustard seeds; however, the subsequent growth of the seedlings was significantly inhibited. Further studies performed on white mustard and cornflower plants in a stage of 4-6 leaves allowed us to conclude that in the case of sensitive plants, the high phytotoxicity can be attributed to the presence of the dicamba anion, whereas for more resistant plants the additional influence of the cation on the phytotoxic effect is visible. Esterquats comprising a dodecyl substituent or longer had high surface active properties. Nonetheless, their contact angle values were not correlated with phytotoxicity data, indicating an additional influence of the cation on this stage of plant development.

This study reports the solubilization of organochlorine pesticides (DDT or -HCH) in oil-in-water (Winsor I) microemulsions (mu E) composed of non-ionic surfactant (Tween 80 or Triton X-100), plant oil (linseed oil or soybean oil), and the cosurfactant (1-pentanol). Results show that the cosurfactant to surfactant ratio (C/S ratio, w/w) is the major factor influencing the microemulsion formation, and C/S ratios of 1:3 and 1:6 are superior to 1:1 for microemulsion formation. 66.9-95.6% and 51.9-80.9% of DDT solubilization enhancements were achieved by microemulsions based respectively on Tween 80 or Triton X-100 as compared to their respective surfactant solution alone, indicating the higher solubilizing capacities of microemulsion systems. The solubilization of -HCH also increased by 40.6-57.5% in microemulsion formed with Tween 80 and 43.0-65.8% in microemulsion formed with Triton X-100, compared with that in corresponding surfactant solutions only. Further studies revealed that both cosurfactant content and oil content could influence the solubilizing capacity of microemulsions system, and higher solubilizing capacity could be obtained when more cosurfactant or oil were emulsified in microemulsion system. Between the two, oil content is more influential than cosurfactant content. The present results affirm the effective role of microemulsions formed with Tween 80 and Triton X-100 in enhancing the solubilization of DDT and -HCH which would facilitate remediation of soils contaminated with these compounds.",2011,32,269,279,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2010.496468

Among all enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods, surfactant injection is a well-known technique that reduces the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water and increases oil production. Despite numerous advantages of using surfactants, there are also a few obstacles like environmental impacts, high cost, effect on humans and other organisms due to toxicological potential, and availability from nonrenewable resources. Biosurfactants are microbial surface-active agents that decrease the surface tension (ST) of a liquid phase and the IFT of two diverse phases. They are biotechnological products of high value owing to their widespread applications, low toxicity, relatively easy preparation, and specific performance, applied in different industries like organic chemicals and fertilizers, agrochemicals, metallurgy and mining, cosmetics, foods, medical and pharmaceuticals, beverages, environmental management, and petroleum and petrochemical applications in emulsifying and demulsifying wetting agents, detergent spreading and foaming agents, and functional food ingredients. Biosurfactants are synthesized by microbes; therefore, various genetic diversities of microorganisms provide the considerable capability to produce new types of biosurfactants, which can develop EOR technology. Biosurfactants are classified into ex situ and in situ MEOR processes. The genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Sphingomonas, and Actinobacteria are the foremost biosurfactant-producing bacteria. This paper reviews relevant reports and results from various presented papers by researchers and companies on applications of microorganisms and biosurfactant technology with specific emphasis on EOR and MEOR processes, based on recently published articles since 2010 until now.",2021,2021,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5477185

Furthermore, composition of commercially available Australian TTO is specified under an International Organization for Standardization standard (ISO 4730), reducing the potential for variable effects often noted with botanical pesticides. The effect of TTO, meeting the ISO standard for terpinen-4-ol chemotype, was tested against sheep lice (Bovicola ovis Schrank) in a series of laboratory studies. Immersion of wool for 60s in formulations containing concentrations of 1% TTO and above caused 100% mortality of adult lice and eggs. Exposure to vapours from TTO, delivered as droplets in fumigation chambers and when applied to wool also caused high mortality in both lice and eggs. The main active component of TTO in the fumigant tests was terpinen-4-ol. Treated surface assays and tests with wool where the formulation was allowed to dry before exposure of lice indicated low persistence. These studies demonstrate that TTO is highly toxic to sheep lice and active at concentrations that suggest potential for the development of TTO-based ovine lousicides. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to assess possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between the application of surfactants and the mineral fertilization, a first agronomical trial on lettuce, by testing a non-ionic surfactant formulation (45% fatty acid ester, 45% sorbitan sesquioctanoate and 10% propylene glycol), was carried out. The surfactant was administered to lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Iceberg') in 2 or 3 application, through irrigation water, in presence or absence of mineral fertilization (granular urea). After 21 days, biometric parameters, nutrient uptake and potential interaction effect between the surfactant and the fertilizer were evaluated by ICP-AES and vector analysis. After 3 surfactant applications and in absence of fertilization, results highlighted a probable detrimental and/or phytotoxic effect on plant growth. Root growth was more influenced by surfactant applications, interacting with the mineral fertilization: without fertilization, a negative effect on root fresh and dry weight was noticed, but on the contrary, in fertilized lettuce, the same biometric parameters significantly increased. The vector analysis allowed to highlight an increased nutrient use efficiency both in ipogeic and epigeic lettuce after 2 surfactant applications, after 3 applications plus fertilization and, for the epigeic, portion of lettuce, after 2 applications plus fertilization. Since in fertilized soils the surfactant induces improved roots robustness, together with a better efficiency of nutrient use, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the tested formulate could act at soil/root interface, probably by favouring root water uptake and, consequently, the nutrient assimilation by lettuce.",2016,1123,157,163,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1123.22

But, the additives may not have been tested as thoroughly as the chief ingredients. The surfactant, nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP40), is an additive frequently present in pesticide formulations. We investigated the effects of NP40 and other constituents of a validamycin pesticide formulation on cell viability and on the expression of genes involved in cell damage pathways. Methods: The effects of validamycin pesticide ingredients on cell viability and of NP40 on the mRNA expression of 80 genes involved in nine key cellular pathways were examined in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line. Results: The chemicals present in the validamycin pesticide formulation were cytotoxic to SK-N-SH cells and NP40 showed the greatest cytotoxicity. A range of gene expression changes were identified, with both up-and down-regulation of genes within the same pathway. However, all genes tested in the necrosis signaling pathway were down-regulated and all genes tested in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway were up-regulated. The median fold-change in gene expression was significantly higher in the cell cycle checkpoint/arrest pathway than in the hypoxia pathway category (p = 0.0064). The 70 kDa heat shock protein 4 gene, within the heat shock protein/unfolded protein response category, showed the highest individual increase in expression (26.1-fold).

They are renewable, non-presistent in the environment, and relatively safe to natural enemies, non-target organisms, and human beings. Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) and custard apple (Annona squamosa L.) extracts have shown promise for pest control, against a range of insect pests. In a collaborative project between the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) over the past 15 years, efforts have been made to develop techniques to extract biologically active material, identify the active principles involved, and develop formulations of active components for use in integrated pest management. Laboratory and field tests showed that extracts from neem and custard apple kernels were effective against the spotted stem borer, Chile partellus Swin., Oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata Wlk., head bugs, Calocoris angustatus Leth., and the yellow sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari Zehnt. in sorghum. Neem extract was nontoxic To the parasites and predators of the sorghum midge, but reduced the parasitism of M. separata by Apantales ruficrus Hal. Efforts are being made to exploit these indigenous plant materials for insect control, on a commercial scale.

The asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins is an important approach for synthesizing optically active epoxides, and thus is widely used in the synthesis of fine chemicals, such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and perfumes. Chiral salen Mn(III) complexes have demonstrated activities and selectivities for the enantioselective epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins under homogeneous conditions. Compared with the homogeneous asymmetric catalysts, the heterogeneous ones have the advantages of easy catalyst/product separation and simple catalyst recycling. And more and more interests have been focused on the studies of heterogenization of chiral complexes. New types of supported catalysts are obtained by anchoring chiral salen Mn(III) complex on a series of phenoxy-modified aluminium poly(styrene-phenylvinylphosphonate)-phosphate (AIPS-PVPA) in the text. All the prepared catalysts are characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis, XPS, SEM, TG and elemental analysis. The catalytic capabilities are investigated with m-CPBA as an oxidant and with indene and a-methylstyrene as substrates for asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins. The supported catalysts indicate superior catalytic activities in the asymmetric epoxidation of a-methylstyrene and indene with m-CPBA as oxidative system, compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalyst (ee, >97% vs. 54% and >99% vs. 65%). The steric properties of the linkages really play vital impacts on the configuration of the transition state for the asymmetric reactions. Contrary to most of the literatures reported, the results show that the heterogeneous catalysts 3a similar to 3d exhibit excellent catalytic activities, and their conversions and ee values increase remarkably in the absence of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) under the same catalytic conditions. The structures of the immobilized catalysts similar to the N-oxide ligand act as axial ligands leading to the unusual phenomenon. Simultaneously, additives are generally regarded as axial ligands on the transition metal catalyst, which make for activating the catalyst either toward oxidation or toward reactivity with the olefin. Thus, there is a steric hindrance when the N-oxide ligand is added and the optimal geometric configuration of the reactive intermediate salen Mn(V)=O was altered. It is steric hindrance that makes olefins approaching salen Mn(V)=O difficult and lower ee values are obtained. Furthermore, these catalysts are easily separated and are relatively stable and reused nine times without significant loss of activities.",2017,75,715,722,http://dx.doi.org/10.6023/A17010002

Beetle, through a patented process, were hypothesized to have an insecticidal time of action (24 h or less after time of exposure) similar to the fumigant methyl bromide. Patented preparations were more effective from plants harvested from a relatively wet site in mid to late summer (5 July to 11 September). Bioassays with the lesser grain borer, Rhyzophertha dominica (F.), 0-3 days after adult emergence indicated an LT50 of 7.0 +/- 1.2 h for the volatiles generated from only 30 mg dry processed plant material (= 0.56 mg active ingredients) per mi headspace. Hatching of eggs of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), was completely suppressed when exposed 4-20 h after oviposition to a concentration of 7 mg processed plant material per mi headspace (= 0.14 mg active ingredients) in a container that allowed passive diffusion and from which the terpenes disappeared by 48 h. Adult red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), had an LT50 of 40.7 +/- 1.2 h when exposed to 29 mg processed plant material per mi headspace. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses of the headspace above this processed plant material revealed five major peaks, all non-chlorinated and non-brominated. The two main volatiles, 1,8-cineole and camphor, occurred initially in a mean ratio of 1:3.2, gradually shifting to 1:2.4 over 24 h. The mu g/ mi headspace of each detectable compound in a sealed container was followed intensely (0.25, 1, 2, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) for 72 h and at less frequent intervals for 60 days. The active compounds released by the plant material in a closed, but not airtight container, were no longer detectable after 2 1 h based on GC/MS analysis. Fumigative studies with the same ratio of the two main compounds generated synthetically indicated that embryos of P. interpunctella and adults of R. dominica were as sensitive to the synthetic mixture as they were to the processed plant material; Although one could apply the precise commercial terpenes in the same ratio, the plant material provides a natural formulation that is conveniently diluted (formulated) to levels safe for handling. Therefore, this preparation method and plant material shows good potential as an alternative to methyl bromide for protection of stored grain, commodity, and space fumigations. No residues are detectable in the headspace of aerated commodity, milled product, or in fumigated space. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Most plant bioregulators are applied as aqueous sprays to a variety of plant surfaces. The total surface area and, in particular, its surface chemistry and morphology are key factors in determining the bioregulator dose that will be retained and, hence, available for penetration. Essentially, all aerial plant organs are covered with a thin cuticle or cuticular membrane (CM), a noncellular, lipoidal covering that serves as the prime barrier to penetration of foliar applied chemicals. The CM is composed of a cutin matrix of esterified long chain hydroxylated fatty acids. The outer morphological surface is usually covered with difficult-to-wet epicuticular waxes, and a well-defined layer of highly oriented cuticular waxes is found embedded in the cutin matrix. While the surface chemistry and morphology (particularly roughness) determine the wetting properties and degree of spray retention, the structure and chemistry of the CM influence transcuticular penetration. Spray additives, like surface active agents, may alter the physio-chemical properties of the spray solution, thus improving wetting, spray retention and coverage. Penetration, however, is affected mainly by the nature (e.g., polarity, charge, and solubility), concentration and formulation of the penetrant, and by temperature and humidity. Specific surfactants may also enhance penetration not only by increasing the interaction between the penetrant and CM, but also by plasticizing the waxes and/or cutin polymer. The physical nature and composition of the chemical deposit formed on the plant surface after evaporation of the aqueous phase of the spray droplets appear to have a marked effect on penetration from the apparently dry deposits.",1997,NA,23,28,NA

Some polyene research still continues with analogs of amphotericin B in the hopes of decreasing toxicity. Much work continues in the azole area with follow-up compounds to fluconazole and itraconazole in order to expand the spectrum and provide oral and iv formulation potential. A fewer class of cell wall active agents that has been developed to the point of seeing clinical candidates is the cyclic lipopeptide echinocandin family. This group has the potential of providing broad spectrum fungicidal activity with a much lower toxicity level than the current agents.

The isolated essential oil was analyzed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the major insecticidal compounds were identified as alpha-humulene (0.72%),beta-caryophyllene (0.81%), and caryophyllene oxide (15.87%). Larvicidal activity results revealed that the essential oil exposure for 24 h period against the third stage larvae was LC50 = 6.87, LC90 = 59.197 ppm and for the fourth stage larvae LC50 = 4.269, LC90 = 50.363 ppm.

The repellent activity results revealed that at 50% concentration of the essential oil showed the highest repellent activity at 60 min protection time against the A. aegypti female mosquitoes. To gain further insights into the insecticidal activity, density functional theory and molecular docking calculations were performed with the active components of this essential oil as the ligand and NS3 protease domain (PDB ID: 2FOM) as a receptor. Molecular docking calculation results show that (E)-beta-caryophyllene strongly binds with NS3 protease domain than (Z)-beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, and beta-caryophyllene oxide and is the major active component for the insecticidal action.

The high dose corresponded to 150 mg/kg body weight 2,4-D and 37.5 mg/kg picloram acid equivalents. At the end of the treatment period, the testes were collected, weighed, and examined histologically and blood samples were taken to determine serum testosterone. Groups of high dose animals were also examined after 1, 2, and 4 weeks treatment. The 9 weeks treatment with Tordon 75D(R) caused severe reduction in testicular weight in some high dose animals. Histologically, the small testes showed shrunken tubules with germ cell depletion. This damage was still evident in some rats following a 21 weeks recovery period suggesting that the testicular damage was permanent. Testicular damage was not due to endocrine disruption as there were no significant differences in the serum concentration of testosterone in control animals compared to Tordon 75D(R)-treated animals.

Since ruminants and cattle are exposed to contaminants during grazing, they are a suitable experimental model for genotoxicity testing.

In a second case, we chose 48 h culture because the lymphocytes usually start DNA replication 24 h after the start of the cultures; therefore, we incubated the cells longer to obtain dividing (proliferating) cells. The levels of DNA damage were measured using alkaline and neutral comet assays. The results of alkaline comet assay showed the significantly increased percentage of DNA breaks in both lymphocytes in medium without PHA (2 h of exposure; non-proliferating cells) and lymphocytes cultured during 48 h in medium with PHA (exposure for the last 2 h of cultivation; proliferating cells). Similarly, neutral comet assay showed dose-dependent elevation of the DNA migration induced in both non-proliferating and proliferating lymphocytes treated with EPX when compared with negative controls.

Dicyandiamide (DCD) is a common nitrification inhibitor. However, it rapidly decomposes under warm and wet conditions, losing effectiveness in the process. Blending DCD with an encapsulating polymer matrix could help overcome this challenge and slow its release. Here, we encapsulated DCD in a biodegradable matrix of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and investigated the effects of DCD crystal size and loading rates on release rates. RESULTS Three DCD crystal size fractions (0-106, 106-250 and 250-420 mu m) were blended with PHBV at 200, 400, 600 and 800 gkg(-1)loadings through extrusion processing and release kinetics were studied in water over 8 weeks. For loadings >= 600 g kg(-1), more than 95% release was reached within the first 7 days. By contrast, at 200 g kg(-1)loading only 10%, 36% and 57% of the DCD was mobilized after 8 weeks in water for 0 to 106 mu m, 106 to 250 mu m and 250 to 420 mu m crystal size fractions, respectively. CONCLUSION The lower percolation threshold for this combination of materials lies between 200 and 400 g kg(-1)DCD loading. The grind size fraction of DCD significantly affects the quantity of burst release from the surface of the pellet, particularly below the lower percolation threshold. The results presented here are likely translatable to the encapsulation and release of other crystalline materials from hydrophobic polymer matrices used in controlled release formulations, such as fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.

The pesticide was made of neem oil. Neem oil is a neem plant product containing several active components, i.e. azadirachtin, salanin, nimbin, and meliantriol which act as a pesticide. DEA surfactant acts as a wetting, dispersing and spreading agent in neem oil pesticide. The neem oil was obtained by pressing neem seeds using a screw press machine and a hydraulic press machine. DEA surfactant was synthesized from methyl esters of palm oil olein. Pesticide formulation was conducted by stirring the ingredients by using a homogenizer at 5,000 rpm for 30 minutes. Surfactant was added to the formulation by up to 5%. Glycerol, as an emulsifier, was added in to pesticide formulations of neem oil. The efficacy of the pesticides in controlling armyworms fed soybean leaves in laboratory was measured at six concentrations, i.e. 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25 ml/L. Results showed that the neem oil used in this study had a density of 0.91 g/cm(3), viscosity of 58.94 cPoise, refractive index of 1.4695, surface tension of 40.69 dyne/cm, azadirachtin content of 343.82-1.604 ppm. Meanwhile, the azadirachtin content of neem seed cake was 242.20 ppm. It was also found that palmitic (31.4%) and oleic (22.5%) acids were the main fatty acids contained in neem oil. As the additive material used in neem oil in this study, diethanolamide surfactant had a pH of 10.6, density of 0.9930 g/cm(3), viscosity of 708.20 cP, and surface tension of 25.37 dyne/cm. Results of CMC, contact angle, and droplet size analyzes showed that diethanolamide surfactant could be added into insecticide formulation by 5%.

The results showed that Tordon 75D(R) (a mixture of the triisopropanolamine salts of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and its other components) impaired the oxidative functions of submitochondrial particles (SMPs). The effective concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of SMP activity (EC(50)s) for Tordon 75D(R) were in the low micromolar range for 2,4-D and picloram in the presence of the other components, while in the absence of the other components exposure to 136 times higher concentrations of the triisopropanolamine forms of 2,4-D and picloram administered as a mixture were required to inhibit the oxidative functions of SMPs. Tordon 75D(R) also significantly decreased the respiratory control ratio of intact rat liver mitochondria. The results show that the toxic effects of Tordon 75D(R) on SMPs (at the EC50) and intact rat liver mitochondria were not due to any additive or synergistic actions of a mixture of its active and other components, but rather were caused solely by the proprietary surfactant. Since mitochondria are responsible for over 90% of the energy production in all eukaryotic organisms, the use of the SMP assay provides a convenient in vitro assay for evaluating cellular toxicity and can be regarded as an informative screening assay when designing chemical products which contain mixtures of chemicals.

As a consequence, most of the pesticides are lost because of pesticide drift, leading to environment hazards. The active components released from the pesticide formulations are either biodegraded or hydrolysed in the environment. They can even contaminate the surroundings by leaching. Therefore, an urgent attention is required to protect resources. Nanopesticides appear as an alternative because they can be used as 'smart delivery systems' for the release of the pesticides in timely but controlled manner, for a desired time-span. This would reduce the risk of environmental pollution and its associated hazards.

In a high-throughput screen for modulators of KCNQ2 channel, a fundamental player modulating neuronal excitability, Mancozeb, was found to significantly potentiate KCNQ2 activity. Mancozeb was validated electrophysiologically as a KCNQ2 activator with an EC50 value of 0.92 perpendicular to 0.23 mu M. Further examination showed that manganese but not zinc ethylene bis-dithiocarbamate is the active component for the positive modulation effects. In addition, the compounds are effective when the metal ions are substituted by iron but lack potentiation activity when the metal ions are substituted by sodium, signifying the importance of the metal ion. However, the iron (Fe3+) alone, organic ligands alone or the mixture of iron with the organic ligand did not show any potentiation effect, suggesting as the active ingredient is a specific complex rather than two separate additive or synergistic components.

Glyphosate (GLP) is the main active component of GBHs. The presence of GBH residues in the environment has led to the exposure of animals to GBHs, but the mechanisms of GBH-induced nephrotoxicity are not clear. This study investigated the effects of GBHs on piglet kidneys. Twenty-eight healthy female hybrid weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) with an average weight of 12.24 +/- 0.61 kg were randomly divided into four treatment groups (n=7 piglets/group) that were supplemented with Roundup (R) (equivalent to GLP concentrations of 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) for a 35-day feeding trial. The results showed that the kidneys in the 40-mg/kg GLP group suffered slight damage. Roundup (R) significantly decreased the activity of catalase (CAT) (P=0.005) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (P=0.029).

In order to verify the effectiveness of proposed method, 30 pesticide samples were randomly collected from market, including liquid and solid, with the concentration of active components from 1% to 80%. For 30 samples, the proposed strategy resulted in a 90% accuracy rate and a 3.33% error rate based on the liquid chromatography (LC) data.

They cannot be distinguished from other plants by morphological characteristics except their pharmacological effects and contain therapeutic agents. Non-medicinal plants are morphologically similar to medicinal plants except some of the members produce active compounds that function either as poisons, pesticides, hallucinogens or teratogens. Poisonous plants produce poison, and pesticide plants are useful in pest management. Poisons and pesticides cause injury, illness, or death to a person if he tastes, smells, and gets it on skin or in eye by their local or systematic action or both. However, the boundary line between medicinal and non-medicinal poisonous, pesticide, hallucinogen plants, etc., is not sharply demarcated, e.g., Azadirachta indica, Malus sp., Prunus spp., Manihot esculenta, Abrus precatorius, Brugmansia sp., Cicuta douglasii, Colchicum autumnale, Datura spp., Digitalis purpurea, Nepenthes attenboroughii, Nerium oleander, Ricinus communis, Strophanthus gratus, Strychnos nux-vomica contain different bioactive compounds including azadirachtin, nimbin, amygdalin, linamarin, and lotaustralin (cyanogenic glycoside), abrin, ricin (ribosome-inactivating protein), aconitine (alkaloid), scopolamine, hyoscyamine, atropine (tropane alkaloids), solanine (glycoalkaloid), nerioside, oleandroside, ouabain (cardiac glycoside); saponins, strychnine (extremely bitter deadly alkaloid), etc. which may be used either as drug principles or poisons or toxins depending on dose and intention of use. Plant-derived pesticides like pyrethrin, rotenone, nicotine, strychnine, and scilliroside from Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium, Pachyrhizus erosus, Nicotina tabacum, S. nux-vomica, Drimia maritime, respectively, are widely used. Hallucinogens are psychoactive agents of natural origin and cause distortions in perceptions of reality (hallucinations) by disrupting the interaction of nerve cells and the neurotransmitter serotonin. Hallucinogens are mostly alkaloids, and mescaline, psilocin, psilocybin, ibogaine, LSD, etc. are some of the examples of common hallucinogen drugs. Topically active hallucinogens include solanaceous belladonna, henbane, mandrake, datura. Pollen from hundreds of weed, grass, and tree plant species, e.g., ragweed, maple, oak, Acacia, Bermuda grass, castor bean, red clover can trigger allergic reactions (allerginosis) in many people every year. Teratogens affect the development of an embryo, pregnancy or may cause a birth defect in the child. Diverse group of compounds, e.g., vitamin D, quinine, anagyrine, and other alkaloids aspirin, marijuana, cannabinols, etc., have shown teratogenicity compounds are synthesized by different plant of the genera including Lupinus, Veratrum, Conium, Astragalus, Nicotiana, Trachymene, Datura, Prunus, Sorghum, Senecio. Some of these plants also cause congenital defects. Natural color and dyes are obtained from plants, animals, or minerals without chemical processing. Roots, berries, bark, leaves, and wood of plants, as well as fungi and lichens, are the major natural sources. Many of the natural dyes like turmeric, annatto, and saffron are food additives and some have pharmacological effects and possible health benefits. The pharmacological effects of medicinal plants are mainly due to their secondary metabolites (e.g., alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, glycosides, antibiotics.) produced in the secondary metabolic pathways, which are often species specific, i.e., found in only a small set of species in a narrow phylogenetic group while the primary metabolic pathways and primary metabolites (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and others) are ubiquitous in plant species. Innumerable numbers of medicinal herbs or their active therapeutic secondary metabolites are used in both traditional and modern systems of medicines. The secondary metabolites may be grouped as nitrogenous (e.g., alkaloids, non-protein amino acids, amines, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates.) and non-nitrogenous (e.g., terpenoids, steroids, saponins, phenolics, flavonoids, polyacetylenes, polyketides, phenylpropanoids.) metabolites. Therapeutically important alkaloids include morphine and codeine from the opium poppy, cocaine from the coca plant, atropine from the deadly nightshade Belladonna, vincristine and vinblastine from the periwinkle, quinine from the bark of the cinchona, caffeine from coffee, tea, and cola plants, nicotine is present in tobacco. Monoterpenes are exemplified by the aromatic oils (e.g., menthol) contained in the leaves of some members of mint family, and pyrethroids are present in the flowers of Chrysanthemum; diterpenes paclitaxel (taxol) is found in bark of the Pacific yew tree; triterpenoids (plant steroids) phytoecdysones are a group of plant sterols are obtained from Tinospora, Asparagus; tetraterpenoids include important pigments (e.g., beta-carotene, lycopene) and are available in colored plant parts. Salicylic acid, a simple phenolic compound, can be obtained from the bark of white willow (Salix alba); isoflavones, lignin (complex phenolic macromolecule), anthocyanins, and anthocyanidins (phenolic pigments) impart pink and purple colors to flowers and fruits. Medicinal herbs include entire plant, plant parts, e.g., leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, wood, bark, roots, rhizomes, or other plant parts in entire, fragmented form as well as fresh juices, gums, fixed oils, essential oils, resins, etc. Herbal finished products include comminuted or powdered herbal materials, or extracts, tinctures, and fatty oils, and mixed herbal product. Finished and mixed herbal products may contain excipients in addition to the active ingredients. Herbal principles that have made valuable contribution to the development of modern medicine include ephedrine, digitoxin, salicin, reserpine, atropine, colchicine, quinine, codeine, vincristine, ipecac, physostigmine, sena, cocaine, capsaicin, scopolamine. Allamandin, helenalin, indicine-N-oxide, mezerien and laphacol, insulin effectors, boswellic acid, withanolides, ruscogenin, harpagoside, etc. are some therapeutically promising molecules identified recently from herbs. Artemisia annua provides new generation anti-malaria drug; bark of Prunus africana is useful for prostate cancer; Sutherlandia is important for its value to HIV/AIDS sufferers. Recent discovery like beta-adrenergic and paclitaxel from Lingusticum wallichii and Taxus brevifolia, respectively, signify the role of plant as an inexhaustible treasure of modern medicines. Different traditional systems of medicine including the (i) Traditional Chinese, (ii) Ayurvedic, (iii) Unani, (iv) Homeopathy, (v) Siddah, (vi) Native North American Herbal, (vii) Western Herbal, (viii) Yoga, (ix) Naturopathy, (x) Folk medicine have been using hundreds of medicinal plants and other accessories in diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and elimination of physical, mental, or social imbalance since antiquity. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a non-mainstream medicine consisting of a wide range of healthcare practices, products, and therapies, e.g., homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic, magnetic field therapy, energy medicine, various forms of acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, Christian faith healing. Modern medicine is based on evidence and clinical proof and is practiced by medical graduates or postgraduates educated in medical college, institute, or university after completion of the prescribed medical curriculum in a stipulated period of time. Before the twentieth century, most medicines were extracted from plants (herbal medicines), and since the twentieth century, thousands of modern drugs have been synthesized from an organic compound. The active principles of herbal medicine are comparable with the contents of modern medicine, and many common drugs in use today were derived from herbal sources (e.g., aspirin from willow bark, digitalis from foxglove) and therefore, herbal medicine may not be considered as mere quackery. There are numerous advantages of herbal medicine including its effectiveness for long-standing health complaints irresponsive to traditional medicine, fewer side effects, safer to use over time, well tolerated by the patient(e.g., prescription drug vioxx-rofecoxib for arthritis was recalled due to increased risk of cardiovascular complications), inexpensive compared to modern drugs, and easy availability of herbs. However, herbal medicine and herbalist may not be proved effective for sudden, serious illnesses, serious trauma, appendicitis, or a heart attack as a conventional doctor using modern diagnostic tests, surgery, and drugs. Self-dosing with herbs, overdosing, misidentification of herbs from the wild source, interaction with prescription drugs, lack of quality assurance, etc. are some of the important disadvantages of herbal medicine.",2017,73,61,104,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-63862-1_3

The presence and activity of a cellular defence system, the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanism, was also established in these organisms. In isolated gill tissues of dreissenid mussels (D. bugensis) the MXR activity was assayed after treatment by commercially available insecticides (formulated products) which contain neonicotinoids as their active ingredients: Actara (thiamethoxam), Apacs (clothianidin), Calypso (thiacloprid) and Kohinor (imidaclopricl) respectively. While applying the accumulation assay method, 0.5 mu M rhodamine B was used as model substrate and 20 mu M verapamil as model inhibitor of the MXR mechanism. In acute (in vitro) experiments when isolated gills were co-incubated in graded concentrations of insecticides and rhodamine B simultaneously, Calypso and Kohinor treatment resulted increasing rhodamine accumulation. Chemical analysis of gills in vitro incubated in insecticides demonstrated higher tissue concentrations of thiamethoxam, clothianidin and thiacloprid in the presence of verapamil suggesting that the active ingredients of Actara, Apacs and Calypso are potential substrates of the MXR mediated cellular efflux. In contrast, verapamil did significantly alter the accumulated imidacloprid concentrations in gills, suggesting that the active component of Kohinor is not transported by the MXR mechanism. Chronic (in vivo) exposures of the intact animals in lower, 1, 10 mg/L concentration of neonicotinoid products, resulted in a decreased level of both rhodamine accumulation and verapamil inhibition by the 12th-14th days of treatment. These results suggest an enhancement of MXR activity (chemostimulation), building up gradually in the animals exposed to Actara, Apacs and Kohinor, respectively. Neonicotinoid-type insecticides are generally considered as selective neurotoxins for insects, targeting the nicotinic type acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in their central nervous system. Our present results provide the first evidences that neonicotinoid insecticides are also able to alter the transmembrane transport mechanisms related to the MXR system.",2018,205,148,155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.10.013
721,Cecylia,not vetted,"Schindler, M",Theory of synergistic effects: Hill-type response surfaces as 'null-interaction' models for mixtures,THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING,"Background: The classification of effects caused by mixtures of agents as synergistic, antagonistic or additive depends critically on the reference model of 'null interaction'. Two main approaches are currently in use, the Additive Dose (ADM) or concentration addition (CA) and the Multiplicative Survival (MSM) or independent action (IA) models. We compare several response surface models to a newly developed Hill response surface, obtained by solving a logistic partial differential equation (PDE). Assuming that a mixture of chemicals with individual Hill-type dose-response curves can be described by an n-dimensional logistic function, Hill's differential equation for pure agents is replaced by a PDE for mixtures whose solution provides Hill surfaces as 'null-interaction' models and relies neither on Bliss independence or Loewe additivity nor uses Chou's unified general theory. Methods: An n-dimensional logistic PDE decribing the Hill-type response of n-component mixtures is solved. Appropriate boundary conditions ensure the correct asymptotic behaviour. Mathematica 11 (Wolfram, Mathematica Version 11.0, 2016) is used for the mathematics and graphics presented in this article. Results: The Hill response surface ansatz can be applied to mixtures of compounds with arbitrary Hill parameters. Restrictions which are required when deriving analytical expressions for response surfaces from other principles, are unnecessary. Many approaches based on Loewe additivity turn out be special cases of the Hill approach whose increased flexibility permits a better description of 'null-effect' responses. Missing sham-compliance of Bliss IA, known as Colby's model in agrochemistry, leads to incompatibility with the Hill surface ansatz. Examples of binary and ternary mixtures illustrate the differences between the approaches. For Hill-slopes close to one and doses below the half-maximum effect doses MSM (Colby, Bliss, Finney, Abbott) predicts synergistic effects where the Hill model indicates 'null-interaction'. These differences increase considerably with increasing steepness of the individual dose-response curves. Conclusion: The Hill response surface ansatz contains the Loewe additivity concept as a special case and is incompatible with Bliss independent action. Hence, when synergistic effects are claimed, those dose combinations deserve special attention where the differences between independent action approaches and Hill estimations are large.",2017,14,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12976-017-0060-y

This study aims to investigate the functional impact of in vitro exposure of pig spermatozoa to low concentrations of Roundup (R) Ultra Plus (RUP), similar to those present as environment contaminants, to its active ingredient glyphosate, and to the non-active component, surfactant polyoxyethyleneamine (POEA). Pig spermatozoa were incubated in Tyrode's basal medium (TBM) or Tyrode's complete medium (TCM) (1 h at 38.5 degrees C) with several RUP dilutions or equivalent concentrations of glyphosate or POEA. RUP treatment causes a significant dilution-dependent decrease in sperm motility, a significant increase in plasma membrane disorganization and reduction in GSK3 beta phosphorylation (TBM) and in two PKA substrates (TBM and TCM), whereas does not affect sperm viability or mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Equivalent glyphosate concentrations do not affect any functional sperm parameters. However, POEA concentrations equivalent to RUP dilutions mimic all RUP sperm effects: decrease sperm motility in a concentration-dependent manner, increase sperm plasma membrane lipid disorder and significantly inhibit GSK3 beta phosphorylation (TBM) and two PKA substrates without affecting sperm viability or MMP. In summary, low concentrations RUP herbicide cause sperm motility impairment without affecting sperm viability. This adverse effect could be likely due to a detrimental effect in the plasma membrane lipid organization and to inhibition of phosphorylation of both, GSK3 beta and specific PKA substrates. Importantly, our results indicate that negative effects of low RUP concentrations in pig spermatozoa function are likely caused by the surfactant included in its formulation and no by its active ingredient glyphosate.

They are usually stabilized by emulsifiers and hydrophilic polymers may be used to form a tridimensional network in the hydrophilic phase resulting in a structure than can disperse the hydrophobic phase and the drug. These systems can be administered by oral, parenteral, and topical routes as platforms for delivery of biologically active agents from different origins such as mineral, animal or vegetal. Propolis has a complex chemical composition and displays many important biological activities (antibacterial, fungicidal, antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulant, anti-cancer, antiulcer, hypotensive and cytostatic). Propolis ethanolic extract (PE) and extract of propolis by-product (BPE) are usually utilized in therapeutics. In this work, three vegetable oils (passion fruit, andiroba and sweet almond oils) were used to develop emulsion-systems composed of Carbopol 934P (C934P) for propolis delivery. The mechanical and rheological properties of formulations were investigated to select potential emulsion systems. A factorial design was employed to determine the influence of C934P concentration and the different vegetable oils on the physicochemical characteristics of systems, considering the presence of PE or BPE. Emulsion systems displayed physicochemical stability and mechanical characteristics dependent of C934P 1% (w/w). Formulations displayed pseudoplastic flow behavior and viscoelasticity dependent of vegetable oil type, temperature and type of propolis extract. The results indicated that the PE resulted in a more structured emulsion system due to the greater content of resin and gum than the BPE. Emulsion systems displayed softness and are worthy of investigation intended the administration on the skin and mucous membranes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Essential oils (EOs) are a mixture of volatile oils produced as a secondary metabolite in medicinal plants, and show activities against pests, insects, and pathogenic fungi. Their chemical composition is affected by several factors such as plant species or cultivar, geographical origin, environmental conditions, agricultural practices, and extraction method. The growing number of studies related to the herbicidal, insecticidal, acaricidal, nematicidal, and antimicrobial effects of EOs demonstrate their effectiveness and suitability as sustainable and environment-friendly biopesticides. EOs can biodegrade into nontoxic compounds; at the same time, their harmful and detrimental effects on non-target organisms are low. However, few biopesticide formulations based on EOs have been turned into commercial practice upto day.

In this study, bamboo tar (BT), a waste product of bamboo charcoal production, was dissolved in natural ethanol and the surfactant alkyl glucoside to manufacture a 50% (wt/wt) BT emulsifiable concentrate (BTEC) biopesticide. BTEC was screened for fungicidal activity against pathogens. The greatest activity was seen against Ustilaginoidea virens with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) value of 6 mg/liter. Four phytopathogenic fungi, Podosphaera xanthii, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium oxysporum, and Botrytis cinerea, showed EC50 values of <60 mg/liter. Greenhouse tests in vivo showed 2,000 mg/liter BTEC had a 78.4% protective effect against U. virens, and replicated treatments had an 80.6% protective effect. In addition, replicated 2-year field trials were conducted in two geographic locations with four plant diseases: false smut (U. virens), rice sheath blight (Thanatephorus cucumeris [Frank] Donk), cucumber powdery mildew (P. xanthii), and cucumber Fusarium wilt (F. oxysporum). Results showed that 1,000 to 2,000 mg/liter BTEC significantly inhibited these diseases. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the total phenolic mass fractions of two BT samples were 45.39 and 48.26%.

Methods: Quality control of CRAE was determined. Secretion of VEGF protein and expression of its mRNA in MHCC97L and Hep G2 cells were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Synthesis of nascent protein was determined by AHA-protein-labeling technologies. The in vivo antiangiogenic effect of CRAE was evaluated with a xenograft model. Results: Absence of organochlorine pesticides in CRAE was found, and phytochemical analysis showed that its components were in proportion of magnoflorine 2.2%, jatrorrhizine 1.68%, palmatine 4.4%, and berberine 13.8%. CRAE exhibited significant inhibition on VEGF secretion from MHCC97L and HepG2 cells at nontoxic doses. The mRNA transcripts of VEGF could not be inhibited by CRAE; however, synthesis of VEGF nascent protein was potently blocked by CRAE. CRAE intervention increased the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) in HCC cells, which blocked eEF2 activity for proceeding nascent protein synthesis. The activity of eEF2 was restored in CRAE-treated HCC cells in the presence of A484594, leading to the recovery of VEGF expression. Berberine was found to be the major active component in CRAE; however, CRAE is more effective in inhibiting eEF2 activity compared to berberine treatment alone, suggesting the additive effect of other components present. Reduction of tumor size and neovascularization were observed in mice xenograft model. Conclusion: Our study postulates the antiangiogenic effect of CRAE on hepatocellular carcinoma via an eEF2-driven pathway.",2014,13,425,434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1534735413513635

Nevertheless, only the active substances are evaluated with a comprehensive battery of mammalian toxicity tests. However, in some cases mixture effects of active substances and adjuvants may occur, leading to increased toxicity of the products. To address this issue, we investigated effects of active substances with known hepatotoxicity and two commonly used fungicides: Priori Xtra (R) and Adexar (R). For this purpose, respective active substances individually and in combination as well as the products were applied to two human hepatoma cell lines (HepaRG and HepG2) in a broad dose range. The results of cytotoxicity analysis, nuclear receptor transactivation (AhR, CAR, PXR), mRNA and protein expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) allow the conclusion that active substances and plant protection products differ in terms of their in vitro toxicity.

One of the current applications of DDT in China has been through antifouling paint for fishing ships as an active component. It has been estimated that approximately 5000 t of DDT was released into the Chinese coastal environment during the last two decades. Therefore, sediments in coastal fishing harbors of China may be the important sinks of DDT. In this study, DDT and its metabolites in 58 sediment samples from nine typical fishing harbors along the coastal line of China were characterized to assess their accumulation levels, sediment burdens, and potential ecological risks. The concentrations of DOTS ranged from 9 to 7350 ng/g dry weight, which were generally 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the adjacent estuarine/marine sediments. The high concentrations of DDT coupled with the lower concentrations of HCH and TOC clearly indicated a strong local DDT input, i.e., DDT-containing antifouling paint, within the fishing harbors. A significant correlation between the total DDT concentrations and p,p'-DDT concentrations further confirmed the existence of fresh DDT input. The overall burden of DOTS within the upper 10 cm sediment layer in the fishing harbors of the Pearl River Delta, southern China, was estimated to be 1.0-5.7 t, which was several times higher than the DDT accumulation in the surface sediment of the Pearl River estuary. The concentrations of DOTS in the fishing harbor sediments significantly exceeded the sediment quality guidelines on the basis of adverse biological effects. The absence or low concentrations of p,p'-DDD in aquatic organisms and human may imply that either p,p'-DDD may be less bioaccumulated by fish and human, or is biotransformed to other metabolites. A national ban of DDT as an additive to antifouling paint was implemented in 2009 in China; however, the legacy high DDT burden in the coastal fishing harbors needs further monitoring and proper management.",2009,43,8033,8038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es901827b

Herein, the microwave-assisted selective polyol synthesis of different compositions of Ca-based NPs, Ca(OH)(2), Ca(OH)(2)/CaCO3, and CaCO3 is reported and the products were evaluated as nematicides and pH adjusters. Two precursors (CaCl2 and Ca(NO3)(2)) and three polyols (1,2-propylene glycol (PG), tetraethylene glycol (TEG), polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000)) that differ in their redox potential have been utilized to provide selectivity over composition. On the basis of the utilized polyols, NPs are produced as inorganic/organic hybrid formulations with a biocompatible organic coating that provides increased colloidal stability and controlled release of active components. Characterization of NPs has been carried out by XRD, TGA, FTIR, TEM, and pH-metry. Each composition exhibited different pH changing ability, an essential feature for agrochemical applications.

PPPs were more cytotoxic than the mix of their active substances. Gene expression profiles of cells treated with the PPPs were similar to those treated with their respective mixture combinations with marked differences.

They contain active components designed for optimized pest management and control, therefore allowing for economically sound and labor efficient agricultural production. A drug on the other side is a term that is used for compounds designed for controlling human diseases. Although drugs are subjected to much more severe testing and regulation procedures before reaching the market, they might contain exactly the same active ingredient as certain agrochemicals, what is the case described in present work, showing how a small chemical compound might be used to control pathogenicity of Gram negative bacteria Xylella fastidiosa which devastates citrus plantations, as well as for control of, for example, meningitis in humans. It is also clear that so far the production of new agrochemicals is not benefiting as much from the in silico new chemical compound identification/discovery as pharmaceutical production. Rational drug design crucially depends on detailed knowledge of structural information about the receptor (target protein) and the ligand (drug/agrochemical). The interaction between the two molecules is the subject of analysis that aims to understand relationship between structure and function, mainly deciphering some fundamental elements of the nanoenvironment where the interaction occurs. In this work we will emphasize the role of understanding nanoenvironmental factors that guide recognition and interaction of target protein and its function modifier, an agrochemical or a drug. The repertoire of nanoenvironment descriptors is used for two selected and specific cases we have approached in order to offer a technological solution for some very important problems that needs special attention in agriculture: elimination of pathogenicity of a bacterium which is attacking citrus plants and formulation of a new fungicide. Finally, we also briefly describe a workflow which might be useful when research requires that model structures of target proteins are firstly generated (starting from genome sequences), followed by identification of ligand-target sites at the surface of those modeled structures, then application of procedures that adequately prepare both protein and ligand structures (the latter also involving filtration that satisfies acceptable adsorption/desorption/metabolism/excretion/toxicity [ADMET] parameters) for virtual high throughput screening (involving docking of ligands to indicated sites) and terminating by ranking of best pairs: target protein with selected ligand.",2015,16,701,717,http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1389203716666150505234923

The use of Clomazone, in particular, has grown in many countries, but in China and other emerging economies in the recent past there has not been the expected expansion, despite the growing world demand. In fact, many Chinese producers have ceased the production of this compound for its higher production costs than other substances. However, analysts expect an increase, for the next years, of clomazone consumption for various reasons, first of all, because it is considered much less toxic than other products. However, in the absence of indications deriving from long periods use, it seems evident the need to avoid recourse to the massive use of this herbicide by carefully observing the indications and precautions provided by the appropriate international bodies (US EPA, EFSA, etc.).

Adjuvants are used in conjunction with 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and other herbicides. Earlier pesticide applier survey results (n = 709) show that 59% of the applicators used adjuvants, and the majority of this group used paraffinic oils and/or surfactant mixtures. As a beginning effort to explore the role of adjuvants and herbicides in hormonally based reproductive effects, a prospective, controlled study was performed to analyze blood specimens from three different exposure groups (applicators using herbicides only; applicators using both herbicides and insecticides; and applicators using fumigants in addition to herbicides and insecticides; and a control group composed of other agricultural workers including organic farmers). The applicators and controls were age- and smoking-matched. Study subjects (n = 78) were tested before, during, and after completion of pesticide application season for the effects of pesticide products on hormone levels in the bloodstream. Of the applicator exposure groups examined, only the herbicide group showed significant endocrinologic differences from controls. Free testosterone levels were significantly elevated in post-season measurements (p = 0.032), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was significantly decreased at the height of the season (p = 0.016) and in the post-season (p = 0.010) as compared to controls. These endocrinologic findings are discussed in terms of their possible relationship to potential endocrine effects of herbicides, herbicide contaminants, and adjuvants. In vitro genotoxicity examination compared four different commercially available surfactant mixtures with 12 different commercial herbicide products, including six different chlorophenoxy herbicides. Only one herbicide yielded a significant dose-response curve. All four adjuvants showed positive dose-response effects.

Nevertheless, mixture effects of active ingredients and co-formulants may result in increased toxicity. Therefore, we investigated effects of surface active co-formulants on the toxicity of two PPPs focussing on qualitative and quantitative toxicokinetic effects on absorption and secretion. The respective products are based on the active substances abamectin and fluroxypyr-meptyl and were tested for cytotoxicity in the presence or absence of the corresponding surfactants and co-formulants using Caco-2 cells. In addition, the effect of co-formulants on increased cellular permeation was quantified using LC-MS/MS, while potential kinetic mixture effects were addressed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements and ATPase assays. The results show that surface active co-formulants significantly increase the cytotoxicity of the investigated PPPs, leading to more than additive mixture effects. Moreover, analytical investigations show higher efflux ratios of both active substances and the metabolite fluroxypyr upon combination with certain concentrations of the surfactants. The results further point to a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of Pgp transporters by most of the surfactants as well as to increased membrane fluidity.

Most research into the effects of agrochemicals focusses on the effects of active ingredients. This reflects the assumption that 'inert' ingredients are non-toxic. A review of relevant research shows that for bees, this assumption is without empirical foundation. After conducting a systematic literature search, we found just 19 studies that tested the effects of 'inert' ingredients on bee health. In these studies, 'inert' ingredients were found to cause mortality in bees through multiple exposure routes, act synergistically with other stressors and cause colony level effects. This lack of research is compounded by a lack of diversity in study organism used.

The nbutanol extract of M. alternifolia mixed with borneol at a ratio of 5:1 enables good synergism in terms of antifungal activity.

Terbuthylazine (TBA), as one of widely used broad-spectrum herbicides, has been recognized as relatively (e.g. vs atrazine) more hydrophobic and resistant to biodegradation, dissipates much more slowly in aquatic ecosystems and often exceeds the EU limit for drinking water (0.1 mu g/L). The in-depth characterisation of fly ash (FA, from a cogeneration plant facility fuelled by deciduous hardwood chips) using advanced in situ approaches (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction) raised the hypotheses that developed nano-to-micro-structure and alkaline Ca/Mg/Si-enriched mineralogy of FA could be effectively exploited for removal of TBA from watercourses. Thus, the aim of study was to investigate dissipation dynamic and adsorption mechanism of TBA in aquatic media amended with FA. The results show that 48 h after addition of FA (1% w/v) to watercourse, TBA was completely removed from its initial level (250-fold higher than the EU limit for drinking water), while in the Control (without FA) treatment, TBA remained nearly 80% of its initial amount. The X-ray photoelectron spectral footprint of FA after 48-h exposure to TBA revealed a shift in peak position and intensity among O, Ca, K, Mg and Si, suggesting that their active sites likely participated in adsorption of TBA and its removal from the watercourse. Adsorption kinetics were clearly described by the pseudo-second order model (R-2 = 0.9997), assuming single-layer chemisorption as a rate-controlling mechanism, but multilayer physisorption and intra-pore diffusion could also be present. The equilibrium adsorption data fitted the best to the Langmuir isotherm model, confirming the spontaneous monolayer TBA-FA interaction with a mean maximum adsorption capacity of 84 mg/g FA (1% w/v) after 24-h contact time at 25 degrees C and pH 12.

This study investigated the ability of an A. niger F22 formulation (Nemafree, 20% SC) and OA to induce tomato resistance against Meloidogyne incognita. Foliar-spray and soil-drench treatments of Nemafree and OA effectively controlled M. incognita in laboratory experiments.

In field experiments, the Nemafree soil drench also effectively reduced root galling. Moreover, the Nemafree and OA treatments enhanced the transcriptional expression of pathogenesis-related 1, proteinase inhibitor-II, and polyphenol oxidase genes and improved the production of total phenols, flavonoids, and lignins in tomato plants infested with M. incognita. These results demonstrate that low concentrations of A. niger F22 formulation (Nemafree, 20% SC) or OA can induce resistance in tomato plants and effectively control RKNs.

The environmental risk assessment for such commercial mixtures applies as default the concept of concentration addition. There is remaining regulatory concern, however, that underestimation of risks can occur if components in the mixture interact synergistically, i.e., elicit effects greater than those predicted by concentration addition. While cases of true synergism appear to be rare, the combination of substances targeting different steps in the same biosynthesis pathway was pointed out as one potential case of synergistic interaction although mechanistic explanations are lacking. The present study aimed to verify this hypothesis using the green alga Raphidocelis subcapitata as the regulatory standard test organism for which such synergism had been indicated earlier. Algal growth inhibition tests were conducted with mixtures of ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors (tebuconazole, fenpropidin, and fenpropimorph). The fungicides were first tested individually to derive reliable data for a mixture toxicity prediction. The here determined toxicity estimates for two of the fungicides were considerably lower than the endpoints in the regulatory dossiers, which had been used for earlier mixture toxicity predictions. Experimentally observed toxicity estimates for the mixtures deviated <2.6-fold from the predicted values. Hence, the hypothesis of synergistic interaction between fungicides targeting different enzymes in the ergosterol biosynthesis was clearly not confirmed for the green alga R. subcapitata.

Concentration addition (CA) has been proposed as default model to calculate theoretical mixture toxicity. However, the suitability of CA for chronic toxicity towards soil organisms has so far rarely been evaluated and therefore needs further experimental evidence. The present study investigated the toxicity of a wood preservative product and the individual active substances (tebuconazole and IPBC) therein with the aim to evaluate the compliance with the CA prediction for the product. Folsomia candida was selected as test organism for this purpose using the endpoints reproduction and avoidance behaviour. Both endpoints were increasingly impacted by increasing concentrations of the wood preservative product as well as its active substances tested individually. The chronic effects of the product could be predicted by CA with less than 4-fold deviation, while the assessment for avoidance behaviour indicated a strong underestimation. This underestimation could not be attributed to the one known formulation additive, an organic solvent. Overall, the present study provides some more evidence that CA could be applied as default model for standard endpoints of soil organisms, but warns against using CA for behavioural responses.",2018,165,284,290,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.08.094

We tested the toxicity of 9 pesticides, comparing active principles and their formulations, on three human cell lines ( HepG2, HEK293, and JEG3). Glyphosate, isoproturon, fluroxypyr, pirimicarb, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, tebuconazole, epoxiconazole, and prochloraz constitute, respectively, the active principles of 3 major herbicides, 3 insecticides, and 3 fungicides.

Fungicides were the most toxic from concentrations 300-600 times lower than agricultural dilutions, followed by herbicides and then insecticides, with very similar profiles in all cell types. Despite its relatively benign reputation, Roundup was among the most toxic herbicides and insecticides tested. Most importantly, 8 formulations out of 9 were up to one thousand times more toxic than their active principles.

A substantial percentage of the active substances applied is retained in the soil or flows into water courses, constituting a very relevant environmental problem. There are several methods for the removal of pesticides from soils and water; however, their efficiency is still a challenge. An alternative to current methods relies on the use of effective adsorbents in removing pesticides which are, simultaneously, capable of releasing pesticides into the soil when needed. This reduces costs related to their application and waste treatments and, thus, overall environmental costs. In this paper, we describe the synthesis and preparation of activated carbon-containing poly(beta-cyclodextrin) composites. The composites were characterized by different techniques and their ability to absorb pesticides was assessed by using two active substances: cymoxanil and imidacloprid. Composites with 5 and 10 wt% of activated carbon showed very good stability, high removal efficiencies (>75%) and pesticide sorption capacity up to ca. 50 mg g(-1). The effect of additives (NaCl and urea) was also evaluated. The composites were able to release around 30% of the initial sorbed amount of pesticide without losing the capacity to keep the maximum removal efficiency in sorption/desorption cycles.",2021,26,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26051426

Although a joint action reference model is necessary for determining whether the herbicide mixture provides less than (antagonistic), equal to (zero-interaction or additive), or greater than (synergistic) expected control, model selection often occurs with little regard to the model's underlying biological assumptions. The joint action models of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) are the appropriate models to consider for analysis of herbicide mixtures of two active components. CA assumes additivity of dose, with herbicides differing only in potency, whereas IA assumes multiplicativity of effects, in which herbicides behave independently and sequentially within the plant. CA and IA predicted mixture responses were computed for a sample mixture data set of mesotrione plus atrazine. IA predicted lower mixture responses than CA; for example, mesotrione at 17.5 g ha(-1) + atrazine at 140 g ha(-1) was predicted to provide 45% (IA) compared with 53% (CA) control of Palmer amaranth. Joint action claims of synergism and antagonism were shown to be dependent on the reference model selected. Although mesotrione plus atrazine combinations were synergistic under IA assumptions, analysis under CA assumptions indicated mesotrione plus atrazine to be synergistic, additive, and antagonistic according to the selected effective concentration (ECx) level and fixed-ratio mixture. Because it is not possible to determine the appropriate joint action model on the basis of fit of predicted to observed mixture data, the appropriateness of underlying biological assumptions was considered for the sample mixture data set.

In recent decades, the incidence of human fungal infections has increased, with Candida spp. (mainly C. albicans) infections being the most frequent, and the treatment of fungal infections is still a clinical challenge. Colonization of the human gastrointestinal tract by Candida spp. is significant because infections (e.g., candidemia and vulvovaginal candidiasis) frequently arise from commensal microorganisms. The aim of this study was to test in vitro the antifungal activity and the eventual synergistic effect of five pure components of essential oils: cinnamaldehyde, alpha-pinene, limonene, eucalyptol, and eugenol. These compounds were tested on 18 Candida strains (15 C. albicans, 2 C. glabrata, and 1 C. lusitaniae) derived from a culture collection of vaginal clinical strains. Methods: Fungistatic activity was evaluated using the disk diffusion method. For fungicidal activity, microdilution and time-kill curve protocols were set up. The checkerboard method was chosen to evaluate a possible synergistic effect of these compounds when mixed. Results: Cinnamaldehyde and eugenol gave the best results, inhibiting all the Candida strains and showing a highly additive effect (FICI 0.625). The cinnamaldehyde inhibition zone (IZ), MIC, and MFC means were 69 mm, 50.05 mg/L, and 109.26 mg/L respectively. Cinnamaldehyde led to the total loss of viable Candida cells within 4 h. Eugenol IZ, MIC, and MFC means were 35.2 mm, 455.42 mg/L, and 690.09 mg/L, respectively. Eugenol led to the total loss of viable fungal cells within 1 h. Treatment with alpha-pinene inhibited 88.9% of Candida strains, with an IZ mean of 21.2 mm, a MIC mean of 195.41 mg/L, and a MFC mean of 251.27 mg/L; this compound led to the total loss of viable fungal cells only after 24 h. Limonene inhibited only 33.3% of the tested strains and eucalyptol did not produce an inhibition halo, so these compounds were not tested further. Conclusions: These characteristics, together with the well-known safety of cinnamaldehyde and eugenol for human use, make these two natural compounds the perfect candidates for the treatment of candidiasis. This was a pilot study, the purpose of which was to evaluate the best composition of a mixture to be used against intestinal and vulvovaginal candidiasis; in vivo studies are needed to confirm these very encouraging results.",2022,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics11010073

Despite a large body of knowledge in the field of risk assessment methodologies for exposure to chemical and pesticide mixtures, there is no single methodological approach in combination toxicology and health risk assessment of chemical mixtures, and therefore professional judgment is still required Generally, the dose or response additivity approach that may be applied to evaluate potential risk for chemical mixtures in human toxicology overestimates the risk of a combination of chemicals. The recent endocrine disrupter issue demonstrated the difficulty of reproducibility of data when testing environmental toxicants at very low levels, and the need for more basic work in this; field The use of integrated methodological approaches may provide more reliable predictive data in the risk assessment of chemical mixtures in future. Yet data have demonstrated that exposure to a combination of compounds does not cause effects stronger than the ones of their most active component, provided components are present at low concentration levels, like acceptable daily intake (ADI) or reference dose (RfD) levels, well below their respective no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs), Although it has been demonstrated that a combination of compounds with the same target organ and the same or very similar mechanisms of action may cause additive or synergistic effects, the chance of such effects will most likely diminish with decreasing exposure levels to such combinations. Synergism and antagonism may both occur at the same time at different organs or targets in the same organism. However, and despite some exceptions, it has been demonstrated that interaction between components is not a common event at low levels of human exposure such as those that may occur through pesticides residues in food or drinking water. The introduction of a special safety factor as a standard for mixtures in addition to those normally used for deriving ADIs, RfDs, or minimal risk levels is not supported by data. it can be concluded from our review that, as a general rule, exposure to mixtures of pesticides at low doses of the individual constituents does not represent a potential source of concern to human health.",2000,3,1,25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/109374000281122

In this context, the liver is frequently found to be the main target organ. Since consumers are generally exposed to multiple residues of different active substances via the diet, it is important to analyse combinations of active substances for potential mixture effects. For the (tri-)azoles, a group of agricultural fungicides and antifungal drugs, combination effects on the liver are likely because of a similar mode of action. Hepatotoxic effects of mixtures of two triazoles (cyproconazole and epoxiconazole) and an imidazole (prochloraz) were investigated in a 28-day feeding study in rats at three dose levels ranging from a typical toxicological reference value to a clear effect dose. Test parameters included organ weights, clinical chemistry, histopathology and morphometry. In addition, molecular parameters were investigated by means of pathway-focused gene expression arrays, quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme activity assays. Effects were compared to those caused by the individual substances as observed at the same dose levels in a previous study. Mixture effects were substantiated by increases in relative and absolute liver weights, histopathological findings and alterations in clinical chemistry parameters at the top dose level. On the molecular level also at lower dose levels, additive effects could be observed for the induction of several cytochrome P 450 enzymes (Cyp1a1, Cyp2b1, Cyp3a2), transporters (Abcb1a, Abcc3) and of genes encoding for enzymes involved in fatty acid or phospholipid metabolism (Ppargc1a, Sc4 mol).

In parallel with the renewal of the active ingredient, polyethoxylated POE(15) containing GBHs were banned in the EU in 2016. Since then, co-formulants were changed and numerous GBHs are marketed with different excipients declared as inert substances. In our study, we focused to determine acute and chronic cytotoxicity (by Aliivibrio fischeri assay) and direct hormonal activity (estrogenic and androgenic effects measured by Saccharomyces cerevisiae BLYES/BLYAS strains, respectively) of glyphosate, AMPA, polyethoxylated POE(15) and 13 GBHs from which 11 formulations do not contain polyethoxylated POE(15). Among the pure substances, neither glyphosate nor AMPA had any effects, while poly-ethoxylated POE(15) exhibited pronounced toxicity and was also estrogenic but not androgenic. Regarding the acute and chronic cytotoxicity and hormonal activity of GBHs, dilution percentages calculated from EC50 values were in the most cases by one or two order of magnitude lower than the minimum recommended dilution for agricultural and household use. Relation could not be observed between the biological effects and type of glyphosate-salts; hence toxicity could be linked to the co-formulants, which are not even declared in 3 GBHs. Toxicological evaluation must focus on these substances and free accessibility of GBHs should be reconsidered. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Anti-mealybug formulations were developed using (R)-(+)-pulegone as an active principle, TWEEN (R) 20 and soy lecithin powder as surfactants, and limonene and diatomaceous earth (DE) as insect waxy layer reducers. The insecticidal properties of formulations against vine mealybugs and their grapevine leaf phytotoxicity were evaluated in laboratory conditions. Pulegone+DE+Lecithin and Pulegone+Limonene+DE+Lecithin formulations showed the highest mortality rates of P. ficus (more than 70 % mortality) at 24 h and 48 h of treatment. This high mortality is probably due to an interaction between pulegone, DE and soy lecithin that allows more molecular mobility and increases the efficiency of the active substance, making it enter and act on the insect. In conclusion, the Pulegone+D E+Leeithin and Pulegone+Limonene+DE+Lecithin formulations can be an efficient tool for the organic control of P.ficus in vineyards.",2020,59,127,132,http://dx.doi.org/10.5073/vitis.2020.59.127-132

It is one of the most-seized pesticides by the Brazilian Federal Police. However, smuggled agrochemicals show characteristics unknown from chemical, physical, and biological viewpoints, which should be determined. Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy is a simple, rapid, and non-destructive methodology that allows simultaneous qualification and quantification of various substances (target and non-target). We developed and validated a method for quantification of the target (glyphosate) in commercial and smuggled products, and qualified the not-target contaminants. Validation was undertaken according to regulation ABNT NBR 14029: 2016 and Association of Analytical Communities criteria. Samples were diluted in D2O and analysed NMR. The method was applied to analyses of 10 glyphosate-based samples: eight commercial and two illegal. All commercial samples demonstrated the percentage of active principle specified by the manufacturer. However, the illegal GLIFP02 sample had a concentration of 33.57% over the reported content. GLIFP01 did not show any formulation description on the label, and showed only 6.10% of active principle in relation to GLIFP02. Also, it was possible to detect polyethoxylated alkyl amine (POEA) in legal and illegal samples. POAE has proven toxicity. Principal component analysis was used to demonstrate that the qNMR method could differentiate between samples of these pesticides. This was the first work to report application of qNMR spectroscopy, an easy, rapid, and non-destructive method, for qualification and quantification of target and not-target compounds in pesticide samples based on glyphosate.",2019,11,4052,4059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay00673g

Glyphosate is marketed in numerous glyphosate-based herbicide formulations (GBHs) that include co-formulants to enhance herbicidal effect of the active ingredient, but are declared as inert substances. However, these other ingredients can have biologic activity on their own and may interact with the glyphosate in synergistic toxicity. In this study, we focused to compare the cytogenetic effect of the active ingredient glyphosate and three marketed GBHs (Roundup Mega, Fozat 480, and Glyfos) by investigating cytotoxicity with fluorescent co-labeling and WST-1 cell viability assay as well as genotoxicity with cytokinesis block micronucleus assay in isolated human mononuclear white blood cells. Glyphosate had no notable cytotoxic activity over the tested concentration range (0-10,000 mu M), whereas all the selected GBHs induced significant cell death from 1,000 mu M regardless of metabolic activation (S9). Micronucleus (MN) formation induced by glyphosate and its formulations at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (0-100 mu M) exhibited a diverse pattern. Glyphosate caused statistically significant increase of MN frequency at the highest concentration (100 mu M) after 20-h exposure. Contrarily, Roundup Mega exerted a significant genotoxic effect at 100 mu M both after 4- and 20-h exposures; moreover, Glyfos and Fozat 480 also resulted in a statistically significant increase of MN frequency from the concentration of 10 mu M after 4-h and 20-h treatment, respectively. The presence of S9 had no effect on MN formation induced by either glyphosate or GBHs. The differences observed in the cytotoxic and genotoxic pattern between the active principle and formulations confirm the previous concept that the presence of co-formulants in the formulations or the interaction of them with the active ingredient is responsible for the increased toxicity of herbicide products, and draw attention to the fact that GBHs are still currently in use, the toxicity of which rivals that of POEA-containing formulations (e.g., Glyfos) already banned in Europe. Hence, it is advisable to subject them to further comprehensive toxicological screening to assess the true health risks of exposed individuals, and to reconsider their free availability to any users.",2021,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.639143

Why most formulations are more toxic to bees than respective active ingredients and how pesticides interact to cause pollinator decline cannot be answered without understanding the prevailing environmental chemical background to which bees are exposed. Modern pesticide formulations and seed treatments, particularly when multiple active ingredients are blended, require proprietary adjuvants and inert ingredients to achieve high efficacy for targeted pests. Although we have found over 130 different pesticides and metabolites in beehive samples, no individual pesticide or amount correlates with recent bee declines. Recently we have shown that honey bees are sensitive to organosilicone surfactants, nonylphenol polyethoxylates and the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), widespread co-formulants used in agrochemicals and frequent pollutants within the beehive. Effects include learning impairment for adult bees and chronic toxicity in larval feeding bioassays. Multi-billion pounds of formulation ingredients like NMP are used and released into US environments. These synthetic organic chemicals are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and residues remain largely unmonitored. In contrast to finding about 70% of the pesticide active ingredients searched for in our pesticide analysis of beehive samples, we have found 100% of the other formulation ingredients targeted for analysis. These 'inerts' overwhelm the chemical burden from active pesticide, drug and personal care ingredients with which they are formulated. Honey bees serve as an optimal terrestrial bioindicator to determine if 'the formulation and not just the dose makes the poison'. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

781,Cecylia,not vetted,"Cox, C; Zeiss, M","Health, Pesticide Adjuvants, and Inert Ingredients: California Case Study Illustrates Need for Data Access",ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES,"BACKGROUND: Many pesticide products are mixtures of multiple chemicals. These include active ingredients intended to kill pests, and so-called inert ingredients intended to improve the physical characteristics of the product. In addition, shortly before applying a pesticide product, applicators often mix adjuvants into the sprayer tank. Adjuvants are products designed to improve the performance or physical properties of a pesticide spray mixture. Manufacturers may use a particular chemical compound both as an inert ingredient within pesticide products and as a component of adjuvant products. Nonetheless, regulations dictate that data on use are publicly available only for the portion used in adjuvants. Adjuvants are exempt from federal registration, but are defined as pesticides in California. Based on that definition, California has identified a-(p-nonylphenyl)-x-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) (APNOHO) as the most widely used pesticide in the state, applied to more than 10 million acres annually. That quantified use includes only agricultural acres treated with adjuvants containing APNOHO. Total APNOHO use is likely higher because manufacturers also use the chemical as an inert ingredient within pesticide products, although data on such use are shielded by regulation. OBJECTIVES: We use APNOHO as a case study to demonstrate that the use of adjuvants and inert ingredients is difficult to track because relevant information is not publicly available. We synthesize information that suggests widespread agricultural use of alkylphenol ethoxylates, such as APNOHO, may pose significant human and environmental health risks. We then make recommendations for future research and policy. METHODS: We used information from California???s pesticide use reporting system and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to estimate use of APNOHO. We used U.S. EPA and European databases, as well as published research, to identify human and environmental health hazards of APNOHO. We focused on research showing that APNOHO is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. DISCUSSION: Within California, APNOHO is applied in more than 150 adjuvant products. Nationwide, it is used as an inert ingredient in at least 650 pesticide products. Exposure to APNOHO is associated with endocrine disruption, birth defects, and aquatic toxicity. We suggest that the case of APNOHO illustrates the larger problem of a lack of publicly available data on use and toxicity of many adjuvants and pesticide inert ingredients. We recommend that researchers and regulators include adjuvants and inert ingredients when evaluating pesticide hazards, including endocrine disruption. We also recommend regulatory requirements to identify all ingredients on product labels. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10634",2022,130,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP10634

Generally, active substance effects are assumed to dominate in PPP toxicity. Nevertheless, co-formulants may well affect the toxicity of PPPs via toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic interaction. To account for potential mixture effects and improve PPP data requirements for application in risk assessment, a tiered test strategy is proposed. The strategy is based on a comparison of PPP and active substance toxicity, which enables the prioritisation of PPPs for further testing, adaptation of the toxicological threshold value or removal of toxic co-formulants from the PPP. Moreover, it focuses on the integrative assessment of existing information and newly generated data using alternative test methods. The proposed strategy will improve PPP toxicological assessment by accounting for mixture toxicity, providing a set of regulatory options for risk assessment and the necessary data for hazard assessment. The predictivity of alternative methods for PPPs will improve by evaluation of their reliability and uncertainty.

These PPPs, which may be found in different types of formulations, are composed of a designated pesticide (active principle) and other inactive ingredients as co-formulants. They perform specific functions in the formulation, as solvents, preservatives or antifreeze agents, among others. RESULTS A research technique based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to a Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass analyzer was successfully applied to characterize the composition of six different PPPs in terms of the presence of co-formulants and types of formulations: emulsifiable concentrate (EC), emulsion in water (EW), suspension concentrate and water-dispersible granule. These PPPs (FLINT MAX, MASSOCUR 12.5 EC, IMPACT EVO, TOPAS, LATINO and IMPALA STAR) had antifungal activity, containing one triazole compound as active principle (tebuconazole, penconazole, myclobutanil, flutriafol or fenbuconazole, respectively). Non-targeted approaches, applying suspect and unknown analysis, were carried out and ten compounds were identified as potential co-formulants. Six (glyceryl monostearate, 1-monopalmitin, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethyldecanamide, hexaethylene glycol and 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one) were confirmed by injecting analytical standards. Finally, these compounds were quantified in the PPPs. CONCLUSION The current study allowed for detecting co-formulants in a wide range of concentrations, between 0.04 (dimethyl sulfoxide) and 19.00 g L-1 (glyceryl monostearate), highlighting the feasibility of the proposed analytical methodology. Moreover, notable differences among the types of formulations of PPPs were achieved, revealing that EC and EW were the formulations that contained the largest number of co-formulants (four out of six detected compounds).

This paper formulates an answer based on two approaches. Starting from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) definition for green chemistry, production-based and environmental-impact-based definitions for green adjuvants are proposed. According to the production-based approach, adjuvants are defined as green if they are manufactured using renewable raw materials as much as possible while making efficient use of energy, preferably renewable energy. According to the environmental impact approach, adjuvants are defined as green (1) if they have a low human and environmental impact, (2) if they do not increase active ingredient environmental mobility and/or toxicity to humans and non-target organisms, (3) if they do not increase the exposure to these active substances and (4) if they lower the impact of formulated pesticides by enhancing the performance of active ingredients, thus potentially lowering the required dosage of active ingredients. Based on both approaches, a tentative definition for green adjuvants is given, and future research and legislation directions are set out.

In addition, the potential use of natural and sustainable substances, instead of traditional synthesized molecules or chemical-based compounds, is addressed both with respect to packaging systems and novel pesticide formulations. In this context, nanotechnological approaches represent promising strategies for the entire agriculture industry chain, from the field to consumers. Traditional plant protection strategies are often insufficient and the application of chemical-based pesticides has negative effects on animals, humans and the environment. Novel greener tools could represent efficient alternatives for the management of plant diseases using promising strategies; the use of nanotechnologies allows the promotion of the more efficient assembly and subsequent release of environmentally sustainable active principles, limiting the use of chemicals in terms of economic losses. At the same time, new sustainable, antimicrobial and antioxidant systems have been rapidly promoted and investigated in the food packaging sector as a valid eco-friendly possibility for improving the safety and quality of food products and reducing and/or limiting the environmental impact with respect to traditional materials.

Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the single substances, the mixtures, and the products were estimated from concentrationresponse curves and corrected for concentrations measured in the test medium. The comparison of the experimentally observed mixture toxicity with the toxicity predicted by the concept of concentration addition (CA) showed less than twofold deviation for all binary mixtures of the active substances and for three of the biocidal products. A more than 60-fold underestimation of the toxicity of the fourth product by the CA prediction was detected and could be explained fully by the toxicity of one formulation additive, which had been labeled as a hazardous substance. The reason for the 4.6-fold underestimation of toxicity of the fifth product could not be explained unambiguously. Overall, the FET was found to be a suitable screening tool to verify whether the toxicity of formulated wood preservatives can reliably be predicted by CA.

(Solanales: Solanaceae) is the second most important vegetable crop in Egypt and is infested with many insect pests. The cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) causes severe economic losses in tomatoes and many other crops. Many management strategies were developed in order to manage the economic losses obtained. In this context, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness using a mixture of Emamectin benzoate and lufenuron or using them solely against the 2nd and 4th instar larvae of S. littoralis under semi-field conditions. Results The obtained results showed that the mixture compound show high initial killing effect against 2nd and 4th instar larvae in both growing seasons. Furthermore, the residual effect of the tested compounds also showed the efficiency of the mixture over the solitary active ingredients. In addition, the treatment of the 4th instar larvae with the LC50 of the tested compounds showed significant impacts against the soluble protein, carbohydrate, lipid contents, and the detoxification enzymes. Conclusion In conclusion, the results showed that the emamectin benzoate and lufenuron could be safe and effective substitute for conventional insecticides either applied solely or in combination.",2022,83,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41936-022-00284-9

To ensure a very high quality of data the studies had to meet a set of quality criteria, e.g. GLP conformity or compliance with OECD guidance. Exposure data and supplementary information on the trials were used for a statistical analysis of exposure factors. The statistical analyses resulted in six validated models for typical outdoor scenarios of pesticide mixing/loading and application. As a major factor contributing to the exposure of operators, the amount of active substance used per day was identified. Other parameters such as formulation type, droplet size, presence of a cabin or density of the canopy were selected as factors for sub-scenarios. For two scenarios the corresponding datasets were too small to identify reliable exposure factors; instead the relevant percentiles of the exposure distribution were used.

Late blight control relies almost exclusively on the use of chemical pesticides, including copper products, which are efficient but controversial due to their environmental toxicity. Societal pressure and the quest for more sustainable agriculture reinforce the need for natural plant protection products. To respond to this demand, we tested the lysate of the amoeba Willaertia magna C2c Maky on PLB. This active substance exhibits plant protection properties against grape downy mildew thanks to a dual mode of action (plant elicitor and antifungal direct effect). We hypothesized that this active substance might also have an effect against other diseases caused by oomycetes on other crops, such as potato. In vitro, in planta, and in-field studies were conducted. The collected data demonstrate that the lysate of the amoeba Willaertia magna C2c Maky is able to elicit potato defenses, and direct fungicidal activity against Phytophtora infestans was observed. Proof of efficacy was first obtained in greenhouse, with up to 80% disease reduction, and confirmed in field trials. Formulated products provided up to 77% protection in field in the case of low infestation (28%) and up to 49% protection when the untreated plants were 100% destroyed.

Before using nano-materials in such Substances, however, potential risks need to be studied. It should be then emphasised that chemico-physical properties of synthetic NPs depend on their size, form or surface chacteristics. Little is known as yet concerning the uptake of NPs in crops and their redistribution in the environment, and general predictions are therefore not possible. To date there exist almost no analytical methods for quantifying NPs in environmental samples. For these reasons, scientific projects need to be set up to determine the uptake of NPs in plants and their Subsequent redistribution. Only such projects can help answering whether residues of NPs remain and, if so, whether they represent a hazard for man.

Resulting differences in impurity content may significantly affect the toxicological properties of pesticide products. Relevant impurities are those that may exhibit pronounced toxic effects compared to the active ingredient, affect phytotoxicity or physical properties of formulations, result in undesirable residues in food, or cause environmental contamination. The first safety assessment of an active ingredient by a regulatory body considers toxicological data developed on a representative batch of technical products, with the assumption that the material produced commercially by the original or generic manufacturers has an equal or higher content of active ingredient and contains the same or fewer impurities at equal or lower concentrations as the fully characterized technical product used in the toxicological tests. Three steps are essential for ensuring the safety of commercial technical-grade pesticide products, whether produced by the original manufacturer or by generic manufacturers. First, the identity and chemical structure of the impurities must be elucidated. This should include positive identification of major (greater than or equal to1%) and all toxicologically or environmentally relevant impurities, and characterization of minor impurities (greater than or equal to0.1%). Second, in addition to recognition of a minimum active ingredient content, official specifications should also list relevant impurities and their maximum permissible concentrations. Implementation of these specifications should be aided by a decision-making scheme for establishing similarity of subsequently evaluated technical products. Third, appropriate analytical methods for the detection and quantification of impurity levels should be developed and employed in a quality-monitoring program associated with the manufacturing and formulation process.",2003,75,937,973,http://dx.doi.org/10.1351/pac200375070937

Translocation of eight ingested baits by adult male Blattella germanica (L.) was examined in relation to the type of the active ingredient, formulation, and foraging area. Ingested boric acid, chlorpyrifos, fipronil, and hydramethylnon that were excreted by adults in small dishes killed 100% of first instars within 10 d and > 50% of second instars within 14 d. Residues from these ingested baits were also highly effective on nymphs in larger arenas and killed 16-100% of the adults. However, when the baits and dead cockroaches were removed from the large arenas and replaced with new cockroaches, only residues of the slow-acting hydramethylnon killed most of the nymphs and adults, whereas residues of fast acting insecticides (chlorpyrifos and fipronil) killed fewer nymphs and adults. Excretions from cockroaches that ingested abamectin baits failed to cause significant mortality in cockroaches that contacted the residues. These results suggest that hydramethylnon is highly effective in these assays because cockroaches that feed on the bait have ample time to return to their shelter and defecate insecticide-laden feces, The relatively high concentration of hydramethylnon in the bait (2.15%) and its apparent stability in the digestive tract and feces probably contribute to the efficacy of hydramethylnon. To control for differences among baits in inert ingredients and the amount of active ingredient, we compared 1% chlorpyrifos with 1% hydramethylnon in identical baits. Again, hydramethylnon residues provided greater secondary kill, but the results highlighted the importance of the inert ingredients. We conclude that, in the absence of cannibalism and necrophagy, translocation of baits and secondary kill are most effective with slow acting insecticides in palatable baits that can traverse the digestive tract and be deposited within and around the cockroach aggregation.",2001,94,1229,1236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-94.5.1229

Defining them is thus one of the main challenges of a risk assessment scheme design. In the light of the scientific publications on the subject, the existing risk coefficients and methodologies used for the toxicity evaluation under international guidelines result questionable. Results: LD50 values have shown to be variable. Prolonged effects following single contact can sometimes be observed when measuring the acute toxicity. The trigger value (10) of the risk coefficient results as inadequate. The toxicity derived from the exposure to substances continuously available for bees at sub-lethal doses needs to be evaluated separately, given the wide differences between acute and chronic lethal effects of pesticides. Conclusions: The observation period of the mortality tests should be lengthened as long as mortality increases, and while control mortality remains acceptable. Whenever active substances can pollute bees' food sources, first tier tests should include laboratory tests: (1) on adult bees with: (a) acute toxicity tests; (b) chronic toxicity tests; (c) behavioural tests; and (2) larvae toxicity tests.

To study the heterogeneity of data across countries, cause of poisonings, and treatment facilities. Methods: We searched literature databases as well as the internet for studies on case-fatality and severity scores of pesticide poisoning. Studies published between 1990 and 2014 providing information on active ingredients in pesticides or chemical groups of active ingredients were included. The variability of case-fatality-ratios was analyzed by computing the coefficient of variation as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. Findings: A total of 149 papers were identified of which 67 could be included after assessment. Case-fatality-ratio (CFR) on 66 active ingredients and additionally on 13 groups of active ingredients were reported from 20 countries. The overall median CFR for group of pesticides was 9%, for single pesticides 8%. Of those 12 active ingredients with a CFR above 20% more than half are WHO-classified as moderately hazardous or unlikely to present acute hazard. Two of seven pesticides considered unlikely to present hazard in normal use showed a CFR above 20%. The cross-study variability of reported case fatality was rather low. Studies most often utilized the Glasgow Coma Score for grading the severity of poisoning. Conclusion: Although human pesticide poisoning is a serious public health problem, an unexpectedly small number of publications report on the clinical outcomes within our study period. However, CFRs of acute human pesticide poisoning are available for several groups of pesticides as well as for active ingredients showing moderate cross-study variability. Our results underline that CFR is an indicator of the human toxicity of pesticides and can be utilized to prioritize highly hazardous pesticides especially since there is limited correspondence between the animal-test-based hazard classification and the human CFR of the respective pesticide.

As a result, the substance is ubiquitous in surface waters. Concerns have been raised about its ecotoxicological impact, but little is known about its generational toxicity. In this study, we investigate the impact of an environmentally relevant concentration of glyphosate and its co-formulants on an F2 generation issued from exposed generations F0 and F1. Trans, inter and multigenerational toxicity of 1 mu gL(-1) of the active substance was evaluated on early stages of development and juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using different molecular, biochemical, immuno-hematologic, and biometric parameters, behavior analysis, and a viral challenge. Reproductive parameters of generation F1 were not affected. However, developmental toxicity in generation F2 due to glyphosate alone or co-formulated was observed with head size changes (e.g. head surface up to +10%), and metabolic disruptions (e.g. 35% reduction in cytochrome-c-oxidase). Moreover, larvae exposed transgenerationally to Viaglif and intergenerationally to glyphosate and Roundup presented a reduced response to light, potentially indicating altered escape behavior. Overall methylation was, however, not altered and further experiments using genespecific DNA metylation analyses are required. After several months, biochemical parameters measured in juvenile fish were no longer impacted, only intergenerational exposure to glyphosate drastically increased the susceptibility of rainbow trout to hematopoietic necrosis virus. This result might be due to a lower antibody response in exposed fish. In conclusion, our results show that generational exposure to glyphosate induces developmental toxicity and increases viral susceptibility. Co-formulants present in glyphosate-based herbicides canmodulate the toxicity of the active substance. Further investigations are required to study the specific mechanisms of transmission but our results suggest that both non-geneticmechanisms and exposure during germinal stage could be involved.

This paper reports the results of a comparative assessment of the acute contact toxicity of four toxic bait formulations designed for insect pest control on livestock farms to the honeybees. Toxic baits consisted acetamiprid, ivermectin, chlorfenapyr, and fipronil, with residues of which on the filter paper adult bees contacted on plastic containers. It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee. Assessment of hazard degree for bees by the hazard index showed that the insecticide bait containing acetamiprid were less dangerous than the other three bait formulations under laboratory conditions.

Seed treatments are now available for H. glycines management. However, it is unclear how these treatments affect specific life stages of the nematode. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of ILeVO (with active ingredient fluopyram) and VOTiVO (with active ingredient Bacillus firmus I-1582) seed treatments on H. glycines reproduction and important processes in the nematode life cycle, such as second-stage juvenile (J2) hatching, motility, and root penetration. The effects of seed treated with formulated (ILeVO and VOTiVO) and nonformulated active ingredient (fluopyram and B. firmus I-1582) on H. glycines reproduction were conducted in a greenhouse. Nematode reproduction on plants grown from seed treated with ILeVO or technical fluopyram (active ingredient only) was reduced by 35 to 97% relative to the nontreated control, suggesting that the fluopyram active ingredient was affecting H. glycines directly and was not an inert ingredient in the seed treatment formulation. Hatching, motility, and root penetration experiments also were conducted using only the formulated seed treatments. Exudates collected from ILeVO-treated seed reduced J2 hatching and motility by more than 95% in laboratory assays. Exudates from radicles grown from ILeVO-treated seed reduced hatching in vitro by 48% in one run but had no significant effect in the second run compared with the nontreated control exudates. There also were no consistent effects of radicle exudates, regardless of treatment, on hatching and motility of the J2. ILeVO reduced root penetration of H. glycines J2 at different inoculation densities in a growth chamber experiment. VOTiVO did not affect any of the processes or life stages of the nematode studied. The results of this study indicate that the use of nematode-protectant seed treatments may be useful in controlling H. glycines; however, additional investigations into the precise effects of ILeVO and VOTiVO on H. glycines life processes and in different parts of the soil profile are necessary.",2018,102,107,113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-17-0585-RE

Even though PPPs contain considerable amounts of co-formulants, regulation and monitoring of residues normally focus on the active substances (a.s.) only. For our study we selected four commonly used co-formulants (three anionic surfactants and one organic solvent) and investigated the formation and decline of residues in vegetables and apples under field conditions. The aims were to characterize the behavior of co-formulant residues on crops and to provide a basis for future investigations on consumer exposure. RESULTS The development of robust and sensitive analytical methods allowed the quantification of residues in the low mu g/kg-level. After treatment with PPPs, co-formulants were detected up to approximately 10 mg kg(-1) in vegetables. In general, these residues declined fast with half-lives of a few days. Wash-off and volatilization were identified as important removal processes for anionic surfactants and the organic solvent, respectively. However, in specific crops (parsley and celery), organic solvent residues were still considerable (approximate to 2 mg kg(-1)) 2 weeks after treatment. We further demonstrate that it is feasible to estimate co-formulant residues using publicly available data on pesticide a.s. CONCLUSION To date no information on co-formulant residues in food is available.

As an example, testing on the formulated product is waived in Europe using an assessment of data for the constituent active substance(s). This is often not the case globally, because some countries require acute toxicity tests with every formulated product, thereby triggering animal welfare concerns through unnecessary testing. A database of 383 formulated products was compiled from acute toxicity studies conducted with northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (unpublished regulatory literature). Of the 383 formulated products studied, 159 contained only active substances considered functionally nontoxic (median lethal dose [LD50] > highest dose tested). Of these, 97% had formulated product LD50 values of > 2000 mg formulated product/kg (limit dose), indicating that no new information was obtained in the formulated product study. Furthermore, defined (point estimated) LD50 values for formulated products were compared with LD50 values predicted from toxicity of the active substance(s). This demonstrated that predicted LD50 values were within 2-fold and 5-fold of the measured formulated product LD50 values in 90% and 98% of cases, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that avian acute toxicity testing of formulated products is largely unnecessary and should not be routinely required to assess avian acute toxicity. In particular, when active substances are known to be functionally nontoxic, further formulated product testing adds no further information and unnecessarily increases bird usage in testing. A further analysis highlights the fact that significant reductions (61% in this dataset) could be achieved by using a sequential testing design (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline 223), as opposed to established single-stage designs.

In this study, we propose lipid-based nanoformulations for the administration of root-promoting phytohormones to different cultivars of Olea europaea. In order to maximize the efficiency of these novel carriers, we devised nanovectors made by lipids extracted from olive pomace, a material derived from the plant itself and representing a waste in oil processing.

Research suggests that pyrethroids are replacing organophosphates (OPs) in response to 2000-2001 US EPA pesticide regulations restricting OP use. A systematic assessment of active ingredients used for residential pest control is lacking. We queried a database of pesticide applications reported by licensed applicators between 1999 and 2005 and surveyed pest control products available in 145 stores within 29 zip codes in the CCCEH catchment area including Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx. Pyrethroids, pyrethrins, piperonyl butoxide, and hydramethylnon were the most common insecticide active ingredients reported as used by licensed pesticide applicators within the 29 zip codes of the CCCEH catchment area between 1999 and 2005. Use of certain pyrethroids and some non-spray insecticides such as fipronil and boric acid increased significantly by year (logistic regression, OR>1.0, P<0.05), whereas use of OPs, including chlorpyrifos and diazinon decreased significantly by year (logistic regression, OR<1.0, P<0.05). Among pesticide applicators, the most commonly applied active ingredients were formulated as spray applications. With 145 stores in the catchment area, 120 (82.5%) carried at least one insecticide. Spray cans were most common (114/120 stores, 95%); gels were least common (31/120 stores, 25.8%). Among spray formulations, pyrethroid insecticides were the most common pesticide class and permethrin, a pyrethroid, was the most common individual active ingredient. In 2007, one store carried a product containing chlorpyrifos and one store carried a product containing diazinon. This survey suggests that certain pyrethroids and non-spray insecticides replaced OPs for pest control in this area.

It includes the creation of dry dislodgeable residues and subsequent transfer to human skin for in vitro measurement of dermal absorption within a standard Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development test guideline (OECD TG) 428 study. A pre-determined volume of spray containing C-14-labelled active substance is transferred onto a polytetrafluorethylene-coated septum and air-dried. The septum is then gently placed onto the pre-wetted skin mounted in a flow-through Franz diffusion chamber. The septum is gently rotated thrice to transfer the dose. Preliminary tests determined transfer efficiency to ensure the appropriate test concentration on the skin. Then, a standard dermal absorption study is performed according to OECD TG 428. Results from 10 compounds indicate that the methodology can be robustly incorporated into a standard TG study. These data show that the dermal absorption from a dry dislodgeable residue is lower than that from the equivalent dose of the aqueous spray, regardless of formulation type or active substance.

We evaluated the effects of acute sublethal exposure to glyphosate on rainbow trout by measuring changes in their metabolic and hemato-immunologic functions and their ability to survive a viral challenge. Juvenile fish were exposed for 96 h to 500 mu g L-1 of glyphosate through the active substance alone or two GHBs, Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Jardin (R), and fish were then infected with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. Red and white blood cell counts (RBCC and WBCC), as well as several enzymatic activities (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome-c oxidase, CCO; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH; acetylcholinesterase, AChE), were measured 96 h after chemical contamination (S1), and 96 h post-viral infection (S2). Mortality rates were monitored, and virus titers at the mortality peaks and seropositivity of the survivors were analyzed at 60 days post-viral infection (S3). Cumulative mortalities, viral titers, and seropositivity induced by virus infection were similar among conditions. Hematological analysis revealed significant increases of 30% for RBCC for Roundup at S1, and of 22% for WBCC at S2. No changes were observed in metabolic enzyme activities at S1. At S2, CCO and G6PDH activities were significantly higher than controls in all the chemically contaminated groups (+61 to 62% and +65 to 138%, respectively).

However, factors such as ultraviolet radiation, the weather etc. could greatly affect the biocidal activity of the active principles in mortars. The aim of this study was to optimize the preparation of several complexes of the biocide carbendazim (CBZ) with clays: natural Wyoming montmorillonite SWy-1 and two commercial organoclays, Cloisite (R) 10 and Cloisite (R) 20, and to test their antimicrobial activity for their potential application in restoration mortars. The optimized material here proposed would minimize the amount of active principle needed avoiding its leaching and consequently reducing its environmental impact with a maximum heritage compatibility. Prepared organoclay-CBZ adsorption complexes were inoculated with microorganisms (algae and fungus) to assess the antimicrobial activity. In this sense, one of the CL20-CBZ adsorption complexes which showed the best algicidal and fungicidal activity was used to prepare the antimicrobial mortar, and subsequently compared to those with pure CBZ as an antimicrobial additive. Furthermore, the mortars specimens were subjected to a standardized leaching test to check the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity. After the leaching tests, the antimicrobial action of mortar containing only CBZ was lower compared to CL20-CBZ which had a good antimicrobial effect.

Such formulation methods and techniques that would allow for extending the efficacy period of the larvicides have thus been sought. Highly promising methods also include EO encapsulation. This paper summarizes the current knowledge, and it discusses the opportunities and prospects offered by EO encapsulation methods when used for the development of botanical insecticides. Although research in this field has only begun, it was possible to conclude based on existing published papers that encapsulation methods may extend the efficacy period while gradually releasing the active substances of the EOs.

Soil, where glyphosate and 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were sprayed on Bt maize, were extracted with rainwater. This allowed to test the bio-available fraction. AR effects were measured with an in vitro reporter-gene assay using MDA-kb2 cells. The cells were exposed to: single active ingredients; formulations; environmentally relevant concentrations of the active ingredients and formulations; as well as rainwater extracts. The AR was activated by rainwater extracts from soil that received a pre- and post-emergent Roundup application. The testosterone equivalents (TTEQs) derived from AR activation exceeded international drinking water trigger values.

Thus, following application, these agrochemicals can inadvertently reach the aquatic ecosystems. Garlon((R)) is one of the most popular commercial denominations of this group of herbicides, considered as highly toxic to fish, even by its manufacturer. Although DNA is frequently regarded as a target of pesticide toxicity, the genotoxic potential of Garlon((R)) to fish remains completely unknown. Hence, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the genotoxicity of Garlon((R)) and its active ingredient (triclopyr), clarifying the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, the comet assay, implemented as the standard procedure, with an extra step involving DNA lesion-specific repair enzymes (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III), was used to identify DNA damage in blood cells of Anguilla anguilla L. Short-term exposures (1 and 3 days) to Garlon((R)) and triclopyr were carried out, adopting environmentally realistic concentrations (67.6 and 270.5 mu g L-1 Garlon((R)) and 30 and 120 mu g L-1 triclopyr). The results concerning the nonspecific DNA damage proved the risk of the herbicide Garlon((R)) and its active ingredient triclopyr in both tested concentrations and exposure lengths. In addition, the higher genotoxic potential of the formulation, in comparison with the active ingredient, was demonstrated. When the additional breaks corresponding to net enzyme-sensitive sites were considered, none of the conditions revealed significant levels of oxidative damage. This identification of the genotoxic properties of triclopyr-based herbicides to fish highlights the need to develop less hazardous formulations, as well as the adoption of mitigation measures related to the application of these agrochemicals in the framework of forestry and agriculture sustainable management.

To fill the lack of data on the environmental occurrence of these compounds, we have developed and validated a method for their trace analysis in the aqueous environment. The method is based on liquid-liquid extraction followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The oligomeric distribution of trisiloxane surfactant in a reference solution was determined by a theoretical calculation and by experimental measurements. Based on these results, the quantification was performed by comparison with a calibration made with a single homologue instead of a mixture of homologues. This approach avoids a time-consuming synthesis of pure homologues and reduces the risk of wrong estimation of the concentration because of different response factors of the sample and the standard. Such an approach could be applied to the quantification of other ethoxylated surfactants following a similar distribution. The validation was performed from 2 to 250 ng/L (total surfactant concentration) in deionized water, tap water, and river water (Rhine water). Knowing the oligomeric distribution of the polymer in the reference solution, the corresponding calibration ranges were estimated for individual homologues. Limits of quantification were found to be between 0.37 ng/L and 15 ng/L. The total recovery of sample preparation was between 77% and 116%.

The rate of AOEL exceedance was greatest in the Greek cropping systems (8 orchard operators, 2.8-16% of total applications; 7 arable operators, 1.1-14% of total applications), and least for the Lithuanian arable system (2 operators, 2.9-4.5% of total applications). Instances in Greece when predicted exposure exceed the AOEL were strongly influenced by the widespread use of wettable powder formulations (>40% of the total pesticide active substance handled for 11 of the 20 Greek operators). In contrast, the total area of land treated with an active substance on a single day was more important in the UK and Lithuania (95th percentile observed value was 132 and 19 ha day(-1) for UK arable and orchard systems, respectively). Study findings can be used to evaluate current assumptions in regulatory exposure calculations and to identify situations with potential risk that require further analysis including measurements of exposure to validate model estimations.

Its production can be affected by management practices and climatic conditions. The objective of this study was to estimate stability of yield and hundred grains weight of six maize genotypes during two growing seasons at two locations, subjected to four different treatments: T-1 treatment-without herbicide, Control; T-2 treatment-active substance Nicosulfuron and Motivell commercial preparation; T-3 treatment-active substance Rimsulfuron and Tarot; and, T-4 treatment-active substance Forasulfuron and Equip. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction-AMMI model and genotype x environment interaction-GGE biplot were used to estimate GEI-genotype by environment interaction. The results showed that the influence of genotype (G), year (Y), locality (L), treatment (T) and all interaction on hundred grains weight were significant. The share of genotypes in the total phenotypic variance was 64.70%, while the share in total interaction was 26.88%. The share of IPCA1 in terms of G x T interaction was 50.6%, while share of IPCA2 was 44.74%, which comprised together 94.80% of interaction. The first IPCA1 axis showed high share in the total interaction, which indicates out significance of genotype in total variation and interaction, while high level of IPCA2 indicates a significant treatment effect. Genotype L-6 had the same mass of 100 grains (37.96 g) during both years of testing, while genotype L-1, with 4.46 g, had the largest difference between years. This clearly indicates the influence of genotype but also stress under the influence of sulfonylureas and environmental factors. The maize genotype with the highest values of hundred grains weight, L-5 and L-6, expressed the highest values of grain yield (4665 kg ha(-1) and 4445 kg ha(-1)).",2022,14,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14095629
832,Cecylia,not vetted,"Mesnage, R; Bernay, B; Seralini, GE",Ethoxylated adjuvants of glyphosate-based herbicides are active principles of human cell toxicity,TOXICOLOGY,"Pesticides are always used in formulations as mixtures of an active principle with adjuvants. Glyphosate, the active ingredient of the major pesticide in the world, is an herbicide supposed to be specific on plant metabolism. Its adjuvants are generally considered as inert diluents. Since side effects for all these compounds have been claimed, we studied potential active principles for toxicity on human cells for 9 glyphosate-based formulations. For this we detailed their compositions and toxicities, and as controls we used a major adjuvant (the polyethoxylated tallowamine POE-15), glyphosate alone, and a total formulation without glyphosate. This was performed after 24h exposures on hepatic (HepG2), embryonic (HEK293) and placental (JEG3) cell lines. We measured mitochondrial activities, membrane degradations, and caspases 3/7 activities. The compositions in adjuvants were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Here we demonstrate that all formulations are more toxic than glyphosate, and we separated experimentally three groups of formulations differentially toxic according to their concentrations in ethoxylated adjuvants. Among them, POE-15 clearly appears to be the most toxic principle against human cells, even if others are not excluded. It begins to be active with negative dose-dependent effects on cellular respiration and membrane integrity between 1 and 3 ppm, at environmental/occupational doses. We demonstrate in addition that POE-15 induces necrosis when its first micellization process occurs, by contrast to glyphosate which is known to promote endocrine disrupting effects after entering cells. Altogether, these results challenge the establishment of guidance values such as the acceptable daily intake of glyphosate, when these are mostly based on a long term in vivo test of glyphosate alone. Since pesticides are always used with adjuvants that could change their toxicity, the necessity to assess their whole formulations as mixtures becomes obvious. This challenges the concept of active principle of pesticides for non-target species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The use of insecticide mixtures utilizing alternative modes of action, as well as new formulations facilitating their uptake, is likely to break resistance and slow the development of resistance. Methods: We used genetically defined highly resistant lines of Drosophila melanogaster with distinct target-site mutations and detoxification enzymes to test the efficacy and anti-resistance potential of novel mixture formulations (i.e. Fludora (R) Fusion consisting of deltamethrin and clothianidin), as well as emulsifiable concentrate transfluthrin, compared to alternative, currently used pyrethroid insecticide formulations for vector control. Results: The commercial mixture Fludora(R) Fusion, consisting of both a pyrethroid (deltamethrin) and a neonicotinoid (clothianidin), performed better than either of the single active ingredients against resistant transgenic flies. Transfluthrin, a highly volatile active ingredient with a different molecular structure and primary exposure route (respiration), was also efficient and less affected by the combination of metabolic and target-site resistance. Both formulations substantially reduced insecticide resistance across different pyrethroid-resistant Drosophila transgenic strains. Conclusions: The use of mixtures containing two unrelated modes of action as well as a formulation based on transfluthrin showed increased efficacy and resistance-breaking potential against genetically defined highly resistant Drosophila flies. The experimental model remains to be validated with mosquito populations in the field. The possible introduction of new transfluthrin-based products and mixtures for indoor residual spraying, in line with other combination and mixture vector control products recently evaluated for use in public health, will provide solutions for better insecticide resistance management.",2021,14,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-04997-8

Several reports and reviews report cardiovascular effects of Roundup (R), pointing the presence of arrhythmias as a potential consequence of Roundup (R) toxicity and death cause. However, it still remains debatable whether these cardiac events are related to glyphosate per se or to the Roundup (R) adjuvants. The present study aims to compare the pro-arrhythmogenic properties of Roundup (R) and glyphosate in an animal model and in human cardiomyocytes. In isolated guinea pig heart, the cardiotoxicity of Roundup (R) (significant effect on heart rate and depressive effect on ventricular contractility) was demonstrated with the highest concentrations (100 mu M). In human cardiomyocytes, the cardiotoxicity is confirmed by a marked effect on contractility and a strong effect on cell viability. Finally, this Roundup (R) depressive effect on heart contractility is due to a concentration-dependent blocking effect on cardiac calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 with an IC50 value of 3.76 mu M. Surprisingly, no significant effect on each parameter has been shown with glyphosate. Glyphosate was devoid of major effect on cardiac calcium channel with a maximal effect at 100 mu M (- 27.2 +1.7%, p < 0.01). In conclusion, Roundup (R) could induce severe cardiac toxicity by a blockade of Ca(v)1.2 channel, leading to a worsening of heart contractility and genesis of arrhythmias.

Herbicides are by far the most widely used class of pesticide in the US, where 556 million lbs of herbicide active ingredients (AIs) were applied in 1995. Agriculture accounts for the majority of herbicide use, totaling 461 million lbs of AIs in 1995. Over 60% of the poundage of all agricultural herbicides consist of those that are capable of disrupting the endocrine and/or reproductive systems of animals. In addition, at least 17 types of 'inert ingredients,' which can equal 90% or more of a pesticide product, have been identified as having potential endocrine-disrupting effects. Atrazine is the predominant herbicide used according to poundage, with 68-73 million lbs of AIs applied in 1995. However, 2,4-D is the most widespread herbicide, covering 78 million acres for agricultural uses alone. Both of these herbicides are reported endocrine disrupters. Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, namely the sulfonylureas and imidazolinones, are one of the fastest growing classes of herbicides. Many of these herbicides are 100 times more toxic to select plant species than their predecessors, so they can be applied at rates approximately 100 times lower. Consequently, they can affect plant species at concentration levels so low that no standard chemical protocol can detect them. Due in part to these more potent herbicides, the poundage of herbicides used in the US has decreased since the mid-1980s; however, the available data suggest that the number of treated acres has not significantly declined. A thorough assessment of potential exposure to herbicides by wildlife and humans is limited due to the inaccessibility of production and usage data.",1999,15,240,275,http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/074823399678846736

Selection of gloves for formulations that contain organic solvents is particularly problematic because a solvent that permeates the glove can carry with it the active ingredient of the pesticide formulation. With a test method that measures the simultaneous permeation of the carrier solvent(s) and active ingredient(s), in particular those active ingredients that have low solubility in water and low volatility, over 100 permeation tests (in triplicate) with approximately 20 pesticide formulations were conducted with 13 different glove materials. These results are summarized and generalizations are presented within the perspective of the large base of permeation data for neat chemicals and another large permeation study with pesticides. Key among the findings is that the carrier solvent generally permeates first and at a much higher rate than the active ingredient. Furthermore, the permeation behavior of formulations containing solvents generally mirrored that of neat carrier solvents alone. Thus, insight into the selection of the most appropriate glove materials for a given pesticide formulation can be gained from permeation data for neat chemicals.

In addition, the frequent emergence of resistance to pesticides and their adverse effects toward non-target organisms have generated the need to develop novel ecofriendly tools for pest control. Among these, plant essential oils (EOs) may play a central role in arthropod pest control. Recently, two formulations (Emulsion and PEG-nanoparticles) of three citrus EOs (lemon, mandarin and sweet orange) showed a promising potential against Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), a key tomato pest. Here, we evaluated the side effects of these experimental insecticides active substances toward (i) the generalist predator of several tomato pests, Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae); (ii) the soil enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase activity, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, acid phosphomonoesterase and urease) and (iii) the tomato plant antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase and polyphenol oxidase).

The role of cyclodextrin amphiphilicity in the imidacloprid uptake,COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS,"This paper describes the synthesis, characterization and sorption performance of cyclodextrin nanosponges (NSs). Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides with remarkable amphiphilic properties, allowing for a vast range of applications. The synthesis of nanosponges of beta-cyclodextrins was carried out using two uncommon cross-linkers: hexane-1,6-diamine (am(6)) and dodecane-1,12-diamine (am(12)). It has been found that the physico-chemical properties of the nanosponges are highly influenced by the chain length of the crosslinker. Nanosponge with crosslinker with shorter chain length is characterized by a higher active surface area (21.8 m(2) cm(-1)), pore size (24.3 nm) and structural disorder; on the other hand, the use of am(12) leads to a higher thermal stability but lower porosity (7.5 nm), suggesting the occurrence of intermolecular alkyl chain interactions. It can also be concluded that by increasing the crosslinker alkyl chain length, the CD gains additional degrees of freedom and, consequently, a higher structural organization is favored. The more compact structure of the CD-am(12)-CD led to less available amine groups, consequently it shows a more pronounced response to pH variation. Such properties make the am(6)-containing NS a better sorbent for imidacloprid - an active substance used as systemic foliar insecticide and veterinary substance. A preliminary factorial study was performed to determine the effect of several parameters (IMD concentration, amount of sorbent, volume of solution and pH) on sorption abilities of the NSs. Hence, the sorption analysis were performed at the optimal experimental conditions pH 3.8, s/l ratio 5 and 25 degrees C in which CD-am(6)-CD shows the ability for an efficient sorption of the active substance. From the application perspective, the maximum adsorption capability is 68 +/- 5 mg g(-1) and the removal efficiency is 95%.",2022,635,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.128044

North America uses the largest percentage of the biopesticide market share at 44%, followed by the EU and Oceania with 20% each, South and Latin American countries with 10%, about 6% in Asia and India. Although biopesticide growth is projected at 10% annually, it is highly variable among the regions constrained by factors such as regulatory hurdles, public and political attitudes, and limitations for market expansion. Microbial biopesticides have been registered in Canada for 35 years, but the number of registrations for commercial, restricted-industry and domestic uses has significantly increased over the past 10 years. The early Canadian biopesticides registered by pest control category were Bacillus thuringiensis in 1972 as the first bioinsecticide, Agrobacterium radiobacter in 1989 as the first biobacteriocide, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. malvae in 1992 as the first bioherbicide, and Streptomyces griseoviridis in 1999 as the first biofungicide. Between 1972 and 2008, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency approved registration of 24 microbially active substances with 83 formulations. The majority of the registrations (55/83) occurred since 2000 and at the beginning of 2008 there were 10 new products (a combination of new active substances, strains, formulations, and uses) under regulatory evaluation. This paper examines the evolution of microbial biopesticides in Canada illustrating how the actions of the government, the people, and the industry have led to changes in legislation, policy, and programming that spurred momentum for new microbial pest control products in recent years and created a model system for future microbial biopesticide discovery, development, and implementation that could be adopted throughout the world.

Hence, the effect of combinations of surfactant and active substance is not limited in the thylacoid membrane but rather on transport from the leaf surface to the chloroplasts.

This compound has a favorable environmental safety profile but was suspected to induce deleterious effects in aquatic organisms, with a potential effect of some associated co-formulants. This study aimed to assess the impact of direct and chronic exposure to glyphosate on the health status of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. A total of 36 genitors were exposed daily for 10 months to a dose of glyphosate representative of environmental concentrations (around 1 mu g L-1) using the AS alone or two GBHs formulations (i.e. Roundup Innovert (R) and Viaglif Larding) and findings were compared to an unexposed control group (n = 12). The effects of chemical exposure on the reproductive capacities, hemato-immunologic functions, energetic metabolism, oxidative stress and specific biomarkers of exposure were analyzed over a period of 4 months covering spawning. A limited mortality between 15% and 30% specific to the spawning occurred under all conditions. No differences were observed in reproduction parameters i.e. mean weights, relative fertility and fecundity. Red blood cell count, hematocrit index, mean corpuscular volume and white blood cell counts were similar for all the sampling dates. Significant changes were observed two months before spawning with a 70% decrease of the proportion of macrophages in trout exposed to Viaglif only and a reduction of 35% of the phagocytic activity in fish exposed to the two GBHs. Trends towards lower levels of expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (between 38% and 66%) were detected one month after the spawning for all contaminated conditions but without being statistically significant. Biomarkers of exposure, i.e. acetylcholine esterase and carbonic anhydrase activities, were not impacted and none of the chemical contaminants disturbed the oxidative stress or metabolism parameters measured. These results suggest that a 10 months exposure of rainbow trout to a concentration of 1 mu g L-1 of glyphosate administered using the pure active substance or two GBHs did not significantly modify their global health including during the spawning period.

Good management can only take place with effective tools to enable the grower, store keeper, and processor to apply best practice. This paper focuses on the role plant growth regulators play in tuber quality assurance and how the tools Fazor (R) (maleic hydrazide) and Aceto Spud-Nic 50 (TM) (chlorpropham) can be employed to achieve best quality particularly in crops used for processing. Fazor is a well established plant growth regulator (PGR) formulated as a soluble granule containing 600 g maleic hydrazide/kg, used world-wide on a range of crops including root and bulb vegetables, tobacco and grass. Maleic hydrazide was first reported to have plant growth regulating properties by D.L. Schoene and O.L. Hoffmann in 1949. Introduction as an agricultural chemical was by U.S. Rubber Co. (now Chemtura) in 1979. Aceto Spud-Nic 50 based on chlorpropham (CIPC) has been used world-wide for potato sprout control for more than 30 years. Chtorpropham was reported as a herbicide in 1951 by E.D. Witman and W.F. Newton and introduced as a herbicide in the same year. Both maleic hydrazide and chlorpropham have modern registration dossiers with toxicology, environmental, efficacy and residue data that has been used successfully to gain Annex 1 Listing in Europe under directive 91/414. Aceto Spud-Nic 50 is registered for use in Russia by Aceto and marketed and distributed by Chemtura Limited. Fazor has been submitted for registration by Chemtura Limited in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Due to the cropping cycle of potatoes, storage is necessary to meet consumer demands and in particular to facilitate the potato processing industry. Mid to Long term storage, up to 10 months is common for processing potatoes and necessary for specific varieties. Fazor is applied in the field through standard hydraulic spray equipment. The active substance, maleic hydrazide, translocates through the plant to the tubers where it inhibits mitotic cell division. With correct timing of application Fazor will assure good tuber development by preventing miss-shapen tubers, secondary growth, and premature sprouting subsequently protecting marketable yield. Fazor will also enable proper tuber curing and provide short term, in-store, sprout control. Spud-Nic 50 is applied in-store through specialized fogging equipment. The active substance, chlorpropham inhibits cell division and will ensure sprout control through Long term storage. The combination of the plant growth regulators Fazor and Spud-Nic 50 provides a complete sprout control and tuber quality assurance programme.",2007,NA,100,107,NA

In this study, we investigated the intergenerational toxicity of this active substance used alone or coformulated in glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) on the ability of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to face a viral challenge. Juvenile trout from parents exposed for eight months to four different chemical exposure conditions (non-exposed control, pure glyphosate, Roundup Innovert (R), and Viaglif Jardin (R) were experimentally infected with the infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNv). Various enzymatic and hemato-immunological markers were assessed before and after the viral challenge. Chemical contamination with GBHs strongly modulated viral trout susceptibility. Pure glyphosate induced a cumulative mortality of 35.8%, comparable to the control (37.0%), which was significantly reduced with Roundup Innovert (R) (-9.9%) and increased (+14.8%) with Viaglif Jardin (R). No modification was observed for the biomarkers analysed for any conditions.

Different formulations using the same active ingredient are frequently available, which raises the issue of potential influence of different formulation types on herbicide toxicity. The present study evaluated the toxicity and teratogenic effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its two formulations (Rampe (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on zebrafish embryos. The crucial difference between the two formulation types is the way of active substance release. This investigation is the first report on zebrafish embryotoxicity of both clomazone and its formulations. The technical active ingredient and formulations caused mortality and diverse teratogenic effects, showing different levels of toxicity. The LC50 values for the technical ingredient, Rampa (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS were 61.4, 9.6 and 92.5 mg a.i./l, respectively. Spontaneous movements in 22 hpf embryos decreased under exposure to both the technical ingredient and formulations. A significant number of underdeveloped embryos was detected after exposure to clomazone and Rampe EC, while no underdevelopment was noted in embryos exposed to GAT Cenit 36 CS. Exposure to the technical ingredient and formulations led also to a series of morphological changes and interfered with the growth of zebrafish embryos. The EC50 based on detection of edemas, spine and tail tip deformations and gas bladder absence (120 hpf) was 12.1, 10.1 and 24.1 mg/l for technical clomazone, Rampe EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, while teratogenicity index (TI) based on LC50/EC50 ratio was 5.1, 1 and 3.8, respectively. The data in this study showed that the emulsifiable concentrate formulation (Rampa. EC) caused statistically significantly higher toxicity, and the aqueous capsule suspension (GAT Cenit 36 CS) lower toxicity than technical clomazone. It indicates that different formulations with the same active ingredient may have different environmental impacts, which is why risk assessment based only on active ingredient toxicity might not be sufficient in terms of preventing formulation effects on the environment.",2017,188,54,63,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.04.007

Ozone and secondary organic aerosol production,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT,"Once pesticides are released into the environment, their active ingredient and other formulation compounds, such as coadjuvants or solvents, may undergo biological and chemical degradation, and form a range of products that could be even more hazardous than their precursors. These degradation products may also interact with the natural biogenic compounds emitted by treated crops, which leads to secondary air pollutants, such as ozone (O3) or fine particulate matter, which directly affect human health and climate warming. This research provides evidence for the atmospheric process influencing the atmospheric and environmental fate of pesticides, active substance chloropicrin and commercially formulated chlorpyriphos, which interact with biogenic volatile organic compounds (alpha-pinene and a mixture of monoterpenes) simulating mixtures of terpenes emitted by orange trees at the large outdoor European PHOto-REactor (EUPHORE). Significant SOA formations were observed during the photolysis and/or ozonolysis of both pesticides in the presence of biogenic volatile organic com-pounds. For the photolysis of chloropicrin in the presence of alpha-pinene, the aerosol and O3 formation yields ranged from 6 to 16% and 167-338%, respectively, depending on the initial conditions. For the photolysis of commercial chlorpyrifos in the presence of a mixture of terpenes, the formed aerosol yield was 24%, higher than those obtained by the photolysis of the terpenes in the absence of pesticides. Both pesticides in combination with terpenes increased O3 formation.

To date, few studies have investigated the efficacy of biopesticide products under conditions that reflect commercial practice. Here we report results from three experiments, one completed under glasshouse conditions in 2014 and two completed under polytunnel conditions, in 2015 and 2016, respectively. These experiments tested the efficacy of three terpene based biopesticides used to control two aphid species, peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae) and melon and cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), on ornamental crops. The three biopesticide products tested were orange oil (60 g active ingredient per litre, formulated as a soluble liquid), the essential oil from Chenopodium ambrosioides variety nr. ambrosioides (16.75% active ingredient, formulated as an oil dispersion) and neem oil (1% active ingredient, formulated as emulsifiable concentrate). The biopesticides tested were applied as foliar sprays using a water volume of 6001/Ha and all experiments were done at Harper Adams University, Shropshire, UK. The biopesticide products tested gave statistically similar levels of control of M. persicae populations on pansy plants as the conventional synthetic insecticide flonicamid (500 g/kg active ingredient, formulated as a wettable granule) and spirotetramat (150 g/l active ingredient, formulated as an oil dispersion). All products reduced numbers of aphids by at least 85% during the experimental period. Orange oil also gave a similar speed of kill to flonicamid and was faster acting than spirotetramat, two conventional synthetic insecticides that are widely used to control aphid pests of ornamental crops. Against A. gossypii on Hebe, orange oil gave similar levels of control (90% reduction in aphid numbers) as flonicamid (98% reduction in aphid numbers), when applied with a spray interval of three days (as per label recommendation). The essential oil from Chenopodium ambrosioides variety nr. ambrosioides was not as effective as flonicamid but did significantly reduced (80% reduction in aphid numbers) numbers of A. gossypii on Hebe compared to a water control when applied with a spray interval of five days.

Rain-induced wash-off is determined by intensity and amount of rain, as well as by characteristics of the active ingredients and deposit patterns on the leaf surfaces. In addition, the micromorphology and chemical properties of the exposed surfaces equally play a significant role. Traditional approaches to reduce rain-induced wash-off focus on the use of adjuvants either to raise the penetration rate of systemic and loco-systemic formulations, or to increase adhesion of active ingredients to the target surfaces. In our studies, we evaluated the potential of novel functional proteins (anchor peptides (APs) as tool to increase rainfastness of innovative microgel formulations for slow release of active ingredient (a.i.) in pest management. For this innovative approach, we tested the adhesion capacity of the APs to bind to the leaf epicuticular surfaces of an economically important fruit crop, e.g. apple. In addition, the phytotoxic potential of APs or adjuvants on apple plants was monitored. The results indicated that the simulated rain (6.5 mm h(-1)) wash-off of the selected functional peptide Tachystatin A2-variant was just less than 2% and had no negative effects on photosynthetic activity of apple seedlings grown under -UV/+UV conditions.

Results. Calculated values of CSAi,,, (103.4-4701.2) and CSAde, (237A-12345.7) for all investigated active substances were more than 100, this indicates to a rather high selectivity of their action. By the CSAing value formulations Celeste Top, Celeste Trio, Dinah, Cydeli Top belong to pesticides with a relatively low selectivity of action when they are inhaled by workers in the process of crops treating, the remaining formulations have a sufficient selectivity of action in inhalation intake. In addition, it should be noted that in general, for all combined preparations CSA values are signcantly lower than for separate active ingredients, in addition to the above assumption, can be explained by the presence of other formulants in the preparation that may have not significant but toxic effect on the body of workers. All investigated substances in the probability of occurrence of acute poisoning with the use of combined preparations on their basis are related to the 4th grade of danger according to State Standards 8.8.1.002-98.

Management of the disease relies on chemical fungicides that have detrimental effects on the environment and human health. In this study, a bacterial strain BA17, identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, exhibited strong antifungal effect against B. cinerea. Filtrate of BA17 liquid culture, when applied at 1 %, 5 % and 10 %, reduced spore germination, spore production and mycelial growth of B. cinerea significantly. Mycelium treated by BA17 filtrate appeared swelling and dehydrated malformation, protoplasm aggregation, and mitochondria became bigger and more numerous with defective cell walls. Assessment of activities of intrasporic and extrasporic antagonistic substances of BA17 indicated that active substances were primarily produced outside the bacterial cell. The active substances produced by BA17 were sensitive to heat, had optimum efficacy at pH 8.0, and were relatively resistant to ultraviolet irradiation. Inhibitory effect of BA17 was not different significantly when stored at 4 or 25 degrees C for 120 d. BA17 filtrate, when applied at 10 %, reduced gray mold on green bean by more than 90 % in repeated experiments.

The present study focuses on evaluating the effects of the active ingredient clomazone and its formulations (Rampa (R) EC and GAT Cenit 36 CS, both containing 360 g a.i./l of clomazone) on non-target aquatic macrophytes. The two formulation types differ in their active ingredient release and presumed environmental impact. In order to cover different ecological traits, two species of aquatic macrophytes - the floating monocot Lemna minor and the rooted dicot Myriophyllum aquaticum, were used as test models. The results of this study revealed differences in the sensitivity of tested plants to clomazone. Based on the most sensitive parameters, M. aquaticum proved to be more sensitive than L. minor to the technical ingredient and both formulations. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach that was tried out in an attempt to create a higher tier step of risk assessment of clomazone for primary producers indicates that tests on rooted macrophytes can add value in risk assessment of plant protection products. The capsule formulation of clomazone was less toxic than the emulsion for L. minor, but more toxic for M. aquaticum. The most toxic for L. minor was the emulsifiable concentrate formulation Rampa (R) EC, followed by technical clomazone (EC50 33.3 and 54.0 mg a.i./l, respectively), while the aqueous capsule suspension formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS did not cause adverse effects. On the other hand, the most toxic for M. aquaticum was the formulation GAT Cenit 36 CS, followed by technical clomazone and the formulation Rampa (R) EC, demonstrating a greater effect of the capsule formulation.

The data show the recovery of this CRF process is > 95.43%, there is no obvious difference with increase of sodium borate added, however, with the increase of urea in the mixture, the formulation has a decrease recovery. In stability test, the decomposition rate of acetamiprid CRF was less one tenth than that of the acetamiprid emulsifiable concentrate (EC) under UV radiation. The release kinetics of acetamiprid from granules with variation content of urea, sodium borate and granule sizes were evaluated in water under laboratory condition. The release data were fitted to the generalized model M-t/M-z = kt(n), where M-t/M-z is the percentage of insecticide released at time t, k and n are constants, and n is constant that indicates the mechanism of release. The results indicated that the release of acetamiprid was diffusion-controlled. The time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, T-50, was also calculated for the comparison of formulations. The results showed that the formulation with the increasing urea in formulation had the higher value of T-50, which means a slower release of the active ingredient, while that the formulation with the increasing sodium borate in formulation had the lower value of T-50, which means a faster release of the active ingredient. It was also found that as the size of this formulation decreased, the release of the active ingredient was faster. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Glyphosate-based herbicides are used globally in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, and in urban settings. Glyphosate can persist for years in our soil, potentially impacting the soil-dwelling arthropods that are primary drivers of a suite of ecosystem services. Furthermore, although glyphosate is not generally classified as neurotoxic to insects, evidence suggests that it may cause nerve damage in other organisms. In a series of experiments, we used food to deliver environmentally realistic amounts of Roundup ready-to-use III, a common 2% glyphosate-based herbicide formulation that lists isopropylamine salt as its active ingredient, to Madagascar hissing cockroaches. We then assessed the impact of contamination on body mass, nerve health, and behavior. Contaminated food contained both 30.6 mg glyphosate and so-called inert ingredients. Food was refreshed weekly for 26-60 days, depending on the experiment. We found that consumption of contaminated food did not impact adult and juvenile survivorship or body weight. However, consumption of contaminated food decreased ventral nerve cord action-potential velocity by 32%, caused a 29% increase in respiration rate, and caused a 74.4% decrease in time spent on a motorized exercise wheel. Such changes in behavior may make cockroaches less capable of fulfilling their ecological service, such as pollinating or decomposing litter. Furthermore, their lack of coordination may make them more susceptible to predation, putting their population at risk. Given the decline of terrestrial insect abundance, understanding common risks to terrestrial insect populations has never been more critical.

The herbicide Zypar (TM) provides a broad efficacy against dicotyledonous weeds and because of its auxinic like active ingredient and its OD-formulation it also proved to be an ideal tankmix partner for graminicides. In addition, the adjuvant (MSO-Type) incorporated in Zypar (TM) increases the efficacy against broadleaf weeds and grasses. No antagonisms between Zypar (TM) and graminicides were observed in the field trials. In some cases the mixture of Zypar (TM) and a graminicide even provided a higher efficacy against grasses compared to the graminicide applied alone. The safener Cloquintocet-Mexyl which is incorporated in the formulation of Zypar (TM) enhances the metabolisation of Arylex (TM) active in the crop.

The upcoming new EU regulation concerning the introduction of plant protection products on the market (EC1107/2009) includes for the first time the demand for information on the possible negative effects of not only the active ingredients but also the used adjuvants. This new regulation requires basic toxicological information that allows decisions on the use/ban or preference of use of available adjuvants. In this study we obtained toxicological relevant information through a multiple endpoint reporter assay for a broad selection of commonly used adjuvants including several solvents (e. g. isophorone) and non-ionic surfactants (e. g. ethoxylated alcohols). The used assay allows the toxicity screening in a mechanistic way, with direct measurement of specific toxicological responses (e. g. oxidative stress, DNA damage, membrane damage and general cell lesions). The results show that the selected solvents are less toxic than the surfactants, suggesting that solvents may have a preference of use, but further research on more compounds is needed to confirm this observation. The gene expression profiles of the selected surfactants reveal that a phenol (ethoxylated tristyrylphenol) and an organosilicone surfactant (ethoxylated trisiloxane) show little or no inductions at EC(20) concentrations, making them preferred surfactants for use in different applications. The organosilicone surfactant shows little or no toxicity and good adjuvant properties.

In order to properly evaluate their risk, it will be necessary to rigorously quantify their concentrations in major environmental compartments including water, soil and food. Due to major differences in the characteristics of their formulation, it is unclear whether analytical techniques that have been developed for conventional pesticides will allow quantification of the nano-forms. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and validate analytical techniques for the quantification of nanopesticides in foods and the environment. The goal of this study was to validate a method for analyzing the active ingredients of two pesticides with different physicochemical properties: azoxystrobin (AZOX, a fungicide, log K-ow 3.7) and bifenthrin (BFT, an insecticide, log K-ow 6.6) that were applied to agricultural soils, either as a conventional formulation or encapsulated in nanoparticles (either Allosperse (R) or porous hollow nSiO(2)). Pesticide-free strawberry plants (Fragaria x ananassa) and three different agricultural soils were spiked with the active ingredients (azoxystrobin and bifenthrin), in either conventional or nano formulations. A modified QuEChERS approach was used to extract the pesticides from the strawberry plants (roots, leaves and fruits) and a solvent extraction (1:2 acetonitrile) was employed for the soils. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in order to determine method detection limits, recoveries, precision and matrix effects for both the conventional and nanoencapsulated pesticides. Results for the modified method indicated good recoveries and precision for the analysis of the nanoencapsulated pesticides from strawberries and agricultural soils, with recoveries ranging from 85 to 127% (AZOX) and 68-138% (BFT). The results indicated that the presence of the nanoencapsulants had significant effects on the efficiency of extraction and the quantification of the active ingredients.

To investigate whether simultaneous exposure to another stress factor influences effects of the contaminants, we performed tests both in the presence or absence of predator chemical cues. We found that the surfactant had significant harmful effects on tadpoles; survival was lowered by the highest concentration of the surfactant in case of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo tadpoles it reduced survival already at medium concentrations. Body mass was significantly influenced by medium and high surfactant concentrations in both species. The presence of glyphosate did not have a significant effect by itself, but it slightly increased mortality in tadpoles exposed to medium concentrations of the surfactant in both species. The presence of chemical cues did not have an effect on the examined variables. Our study confirms that the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides is mainly due to the examined surfactant.

In this study, the acute embryo toxicity of glyphosate into two different fish species-common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and zebrafish (Danio rerio)-was investigated. Lethal endpoints, development disorder, and, in addition, other sublethal endpoints such as hatching rate, formation of somites, and development of eyes, spontaneous movement, heartbeat/blood circulation, pigmentation, and edema were recorded to indicate the mode of action of the toxic compound. Hatching retardation (p < 0.05) was observed in experimental groups of common carp exposed to glyphosate with significant statistical difference especially at the highest concentration after 72, 96, and 120 hpf. The significantly highest cumulative mortality at concentration of 50 mg/l was observed. In contrast, hatching stimulation was observed in embryos of zebrafish exposed to the highest concentration of glyphosate. The significantly highest cumulative mortality for zebrafish was observed only at concentration of 50 mg/l.

These methylated silicones are considered inert ingredients, but their superior surfactant properties allow them to wet, and either suffocate or disrupt important physiological processes in mites and insects. Aqueous solutions of the trisiloxane surfactants Silwet L-77, Silwet 408, and Silwet 806 were bioassayed against adult female twospotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch, with leaf dip methods to compare their toxicity with organosilicone molecules containing bulkier hydrophobic components. All three trisiloxanes in aqueous solutions were equivalently toxic (LC50 = 5.5-8.9 ppm),whereas Silwet L-7607 solutions were less toxic (LC50 = 4,800 ppm) and Silwet L-7200 was nontoxic to mites. In another experiment, the toxicity of Silwet L77 was affected by the wettability of leaf surfaces. The LC50 shifted from 22 to 84 ppm when mites were tested on Lean and strawberry leaf disks, respectively. Droplet spreading on paraffin and surface tension were both related to the toxicity of surfactant solutions. Surface tensions of solutions below 23 mN/m caused >90% mite mortality in leaf dip bioassays. A field test of Conserve SC and its formulation blank, with and without Dyne-Amic adjuvant (a vegetable oil-organosilicone surfactant mixture) revealed that Dyne-Amic had the greatest miticidal contribution, reducing mite populations by 70%, followed by formulation inactive ingredients.

The plant shoots of the grass Brachiaria brizantha incorporated into the field soil were found to inhibit the growth of several plant species. We investigated the variations of allelopathic activity and allelopathic substances in B. brizantha harvested in June, October and January. Results: All extracts of B. brizantha obtained from June, October and January inhibited the root and shoot growth of cress, lettuce, Phleum pretense and Lolium multiflorum in a concentration dependent manner. However, the inhibitory activity of B. brizantha of June and October was greater than that of B. brizantha of January. Concentrations of three potent allelopathic active substances, (6R,9S)-3-oxo-alpha-ionol, (6R,9R)-3-oxo-alpha-ionol and 4-ketopinoresinol were also greater in B. brizantha of June and October than those in B. brizantha of January.

A systematic and meta-analytic review,CHEMOSPHERE,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are among the most used pesticides worldwide. Reviews on the safety of glyphosate have been conducted by several regulatory agencies and researches centers, many times with contradictory results. This study is a systematic meta-analytical review of experimental studies on the relationship between exposure to the glyphosate (GLY) and its formulations with the formation of micronuclei (MN) to establish a quantitative estimate of the environmental risks. The natural logarithm (In) of the estimated response ratio was calculated from 81 experiments. A meta-analysis was performed on the complete data set, and individual meta-analyses were conducted after stratification by test system, class of vertebrate, exposure route, gender, endpoints, type of literature, formulation, GLY dose and exposure time. A forest plot showed an overall positive association between GLY exposure and its formulations and MN, corroborated by the cumulative effects size. Different responses were observed on mammalian and non-mammalian. Interesting results was noticed in exposure route where oral administration of GLY presented no significance. Exposure by intraperitoneal injection presented the highest MN formation. Pure GLY caused fewer effects than to commercial mixtures, but both presented mutagenic effects. The studies with males presented significant responses, while studies with females were not significant. The cumulative effects size was not clearly related to GLY dose, and was negatively related to exposure time. It can be attributed to different test systems, exposure routes and protocols analyzed. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that exposure to GLY and its formulations increases the frequency of MN formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested the suppressive activity of commercial insecticides and their analytical standards (pirimiphos-methyl, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorfenapyr, beta-cyfluthrin). METHODS: The strains of T. putrescentiae originated from a laboratory, a field and dog food. The mortality of the mites due to active ingredients and analytical standards was tested using an impregnated filter paper test after 24 h. Lethal doses, LD50, LD95 and LD99 were determined. A growth test was used to observe the suppressive effect of the active ingredients on mites at 21 days after application of the active ingredients to wheat grain. The effective doses ED50, ED95 and ED99 were determined, indicating the concentration at which the population was reduced by 50, 95 and 99% more than control. RESULTS: Cypermethrin, beta-cyfluthrin and a formulation of deltamethrin with piperonylbutoxide in the pesticide K-Othrine showed low toxicity to mites. High toxicity was observed for chlorfenapyr (LD50: 0.1-1 mu g cm(-2); ED50: 0.11-1.2 mu g g(-1)) and pirimiphos-methyl (LD50: 0.01-0.06 mu g cm(-2); ED50: 0.2-12 mu g g(-1)). We did not find significant differences among the compared strains in terms of their sensitivity to highly toxic insecticides. CONCLUSION: The obtained results showed that a filter paper test is a more sensitive method of identifying differences in pesticide susceptibility among strains, but the efficacy of pesticides against one species should be tested using a growth test.

Hepatotoxicity was monitored by quantitative analysis of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities, total protein, albumin, triglyceride and cholesterol. Creatinine and urea were used as the biochemical markets of kidney damages. The second aim of this study to investigate how glyphosate alone or included in herbicide Roundup affected hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels of animals as an index of antioxidant Status and oxidative stress, respectively, as well as the serum nitric oxide (NO) and alpha tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were measured. Treatment of animals with Roundup induced the leakage of hepatic intracellular enzymes, ALT, AST and ALP suggesting irreversible damage in hepatocytes starting from the first week. It was found that the effects were different on the enzymes in Roundup and glyphosate-treated groups. Significant time-dependent depletion of GSH levels and induction of oxidative stress in liver by the elevated levels of LPO, further confirmed the potential of Roundup to induce oxidative stress in hepatic tissue. However, glyphosate caused significant increases in NO levels more than Roundup after 2 weeks of treatment. Both treatments increased the level of TNF-alpha by the same manner.

Part 2: Chemistry and biology of the cereal herbicide pinoxaden",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: Pinoxaden is a new cereal herbicide that provides outstanding levels of post-emergence activity against a broad spectrum of grass weed species for worldwide selective use in both wheat and barley. RESULTS: Factors influencing activity and tolerance to pinoxaden were in part linked to distinct structural parts of the active ingredient. Three complementary contributions that decisively impact upon the herbicidal potency against grasses were identified: a preferred 2,6-diethyl-4-methyl aromatic substitution pattern, a dione area suitable for proherbicide formation and beneficial adjuvant effects. The uptake and translocation pattern of pinoxaden when coapplied with its tailored adjuvant were analysed by autoradiography, indicating extensive and rapid penetration, followed by effective distribution throughout the plant. Crop injury reduction on incorporation of the [1,4,5]oxadiazepane ring into the aryldione template was reinforced with safener technology. Comparative studies on the behaviour of pinoxaden applied either alone or in combination with the safener cloquintocet-mexyl demonstrated that addition of the safener resulted in significant enhancement of metabolic degradation in wheat and barley, providing excellent crop tolerance and a substantial selectivity margin without adverse effects on weed control. CONCLUSION: The biological potential of pinoxaden and its active principle pinoxaden dione in terms of grass weed control and tolerance in cereals was fully exploited by inclusion of the safener cloquintocet-mexyl in the formulation in combination with a specific and tailor-made tank-mix adjuvant based on methylated rape seed oil.

The combination of both injection modes allowed the tentatively identification of potential co-formulants. Available analytical standards were acquired for their confirmation, and 21 compounds were successfully confirmed. Finally, the concentration of these co-formulants was calculated, finding the highest value in one of the pesticide formulation, at 218.22 g L -1 for cyclohexanone.Results clearly show that this methodology is suitable for the reliable identification of co-formulants in pesticide formulations, offering high sensitivity, and highlighting that five co-formulants were detected by both injection techniques (DI and HS). Moreover, one of the main advantages of the proposed methods was the great capacity for the elucidation of compounds with similar molecular formula, bearing in mind that up to 8 co-formulants with the same molecular formula C10H14, were well differentiated by retention times between 8.46 (1-methyl-3-propylbenzene) and 10.98 min (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene) in one of the pesticide formulation.Toxicity to human health and the environment has been evidenced for the co-formulants detected, finding compounds with relatively high toxicity, as naphthalene and cyclohexanone.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Chitraka is used in ayurveda for relief from many ailments, especially digestive disorders, bronchitis, diseases of liver, leucoderma, inflammation, piles, itching, laryngitis, rheumatism, diseases of spleen, many skin disorders etc. The root extracts of P. zeylanica have been incorporated in various Indian indigenous ayurvedic drug formulations. This paper reviews various aspects of Chitraka like different pharmacological activities, medicinal properties including wound healing, antioxidant, antiulcer, anticancer, leishmanicidal, antifertility, antimalarial, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, trypanocidal, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, anti-allergic, larvicidal, insecticidal and anxiolytic activities. P. zeylanica plant contains naphthoquinones, flavonoids, terpenes, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, triterpenoids, tannins, phenolic compounds, glucopyranoside, sitosterol saponins, coumarins, carbohydrates, fixed oils, fats and proteins having a wide variety of bioactivities. The important compound responsible for bioactivity is plumbagin which is chemically 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. Studies of P. zeylanica roots resulted in identification of plumbagin and lawsone as an active principle exhibiting the plasmid elimination activity. Due to the toxicity of chemical curing agents like acridine orange or ethidium bromide, there is a constant need of developing novel curing agents which are more effective and at the same time their nontoxic nature. Bacterial strains resistant to multiple antibiotics have emerged to which the invention of new antibiotics has failed to match up. The effects of antibiotic resistance are serious with mortality and morbidity constantly on the rise. Therefore P. zeylanica root extracts containing lawsone and plumbagin would have great potential as drugs of choice in the treatment of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. The already ineffective antibiotic therapy can be made effective by converting antibiotic resistant bacteria into sensitive ones. The present review for the first time depicts the use of P. zeylanica as antimicrobial and plasmid curing agent in medicinal formulations and it is a novel approach towards the spread of antibiotic resistance especially in the hospital environment.",2020,10,P139,P153,http://dx.doi.org/10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2020.10.5.P139-153

Recently, populations of honey bees have been declining due to a combination of factors, including the widespread use of agricultural pesticides. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the acute oral toxicity of different formulated pesticides to honey bee adults. In particular, we assessed the acute oral toxicity of two neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, Assail 30SG and thiamethoxam, Actara 25WDG) and two other systemic insecticide products (sulfoxaflor, Closer 2SC and flupyradifurone, Sivanto 200SL), all of which are generally used in pest management programs in commercial apple orchards in the Eastern United States. Honey bees were fed a range of doses of each pesticide in order to create a response curve, and LC50, LC90, and LD50 values were determined. The pesticide formulation containing flupyradifurone as the active ingredient was found to be the least toxic to honey bees followed by the formulations containing sulfoxaflor and acetamiprid. The toxicity values obtained in this study differ from other studies testing only technical active ingredient compounds, suggesting the need to evaluate formulated products while conducting ecotoxicological risk assessment.",2022,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments9070090

Its utilization is growing with genetically modified organisms engineered to tolerate GBH. Millions of farmers suffer poisoning and death in developing countries, and occupational exposures and suicide make GBH toxicity a worldwide concern. As GBH is found in human plasma, widespread hospital facilities for measuring it should be encouraged. Plasma determination is an essential prerequisite for risk assessment in GBH intoxication. Only when standard ECGs were performed, at least one abnormal ECG was detected in the large majority of cases after intoxication. QTc prolongation and arrhythmias along with first-degree atrioventricular block were observed after GBH intoxication. Thus, life-threatening arrhythmias might be the cause of death in GBH intoxication. Cardiac cellular effects of GBH were reviewed along with few case reports in men and scanty larger studies. We observed in two mammalian species (rats and rabbits) direct cardiac electrophysiological changes, conduction blocks and arrhythmias among GBH-mediated effects.

A commercial herbicide combining terbuthylazine and nicosulfuron as active substances (a.s.) was selected as a model PPP. The suitability of manipulating the ratio between a.s. towards alternative formulations with reduced impacts in a non-target indicator (Lemna minor) was assessed. The efficacy of such eco-friendlier a.s. ratios was then assessed using a target weed, Portulaca oleracea. Single and mixture toxicity testing with L. minor revealed an antagonistic joint action of the a.s., suggesting an environmentally protective effect of the combination compared to single dosing of a.s. The efficacy testing against the target weed of single and combined treatments of the a.s. showed that (i) the a.s. behave antagonistically throughout the whole P. oleracea response surface; (ii) there were no environmentally safe a.s. combinations ensuring target-efficacy; (iii) terbuthylazine alone was effective in controlling P. oleracea with no environmental hazardous potential, dosed at concentrations 10-fold lower than those involved in commercially recommended application doses. Overall, this case-study suggests that modelling tools widely used in the field of environmental risk assessment of PPPs may also have application in PPP design stages for a more efficient meeting of efficacy and environmental friendliness requirements.",2018,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23883-5

Abnormalities in the regulation of the cell cycle result in death or diseases such as cancer. Early development of sea urchin has proved to be a powerful model for cell division studies and offers the opportunity to study synchronous cell divisions in the absence of transcriptional control. We have analyzed pesticide-induced dysfunctions in the first cell division following fertilization in sea urchin embryos, using Roundup, a widely used pesticide formulation containing isopropylamine glyphosate as the active substance. The pesticide induced cell cycle dysfunction by preventing the in vivo activation of the universal cell cycle regulator CDK1/cyclin B. We further show that synthesis of the regulator protein, cyclin B, as well as its association to the catalytic protein, CDK1, were not affected by the pesticide. Therefore, our results suggest that the pollutant impedes the processing of the CDK1/cyclin B complex, which is required in its physiological activation.

Shortly before the announcement of the conflicting views regarding the carcinogenicity status of this regulated agrochemical by EU Agencies, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the one hand, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on the other hand, the Cancer Assessment Review Committee of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) also published re-evaluations. The US EPA assessment classified glyphosate into Group E, not likely to be carcinogenic to humans. Similar positions were reached by EFSA and ECHA, assessing glyphosate as unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and not classified as a carcinogen, respectively. A strongly opposing evaluation has previously been reached by IARC by classifying glyphosate into Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. IARC identified potential cancer hazards in this case, but did not estimate the level of risk it may present, which was taken into consideration by opposing agencies. Multiple effects of glyphosate have been reported, of which carcinogenic effects are only one component. Formulated glyphosate products-especially with polyethoxylated tallowamine and related compounds-have been shown to cause stronger cytotoxic or endocrine disrupting effects than the active ingredient glyphosate alone. Questions related to hazards and corresponding risks identified in relation to this active ingredient and its formulated herbicide preparations divide scientific circles and official health and environmental authorities and organizations, and touch upon fundamental aspects of risk assessment and product regulation. The decision has to consider both hazard-based (IARC) and risk-based analysis (EFSA); the former may not be suitable to calculate practical significances, and the latter being challenged if exposure estimations are uncertain in light of new data on residue levels. The results of current analytical surveys on surface water are particularly worrisome. In turn, the precautionary principle appears to be the optimal approach in this case for regulation in the EU.",2018,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2018.00078

Recent findings indicate that G exposure may cause DNA damage and cancer in humans. Aim of this investigation was to study the cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of G and R (UltraMax) in a buccal epithelial cell line (TR146), as workers are exposed via inhalation to the herbicide. R induced acute cytotoxic effects at concentrations > 40 mg/l after 20 min, which were due to membrane damage and impairment of mitochondrial functions. With G, increased release of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase indicative for membrane damage was observed at doses > 80 mg/l. Both G and R induced DNA migration in single-cell gel electrophoresis assays at doses > 20 mg/l. Furthermore, an increase of nuclear aberrations that reflect DNA damage was observed. The frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear buds were elevated after 20-min exposure to 10-20 mg/l, while nucleoplasmatic bridges were only enhanced by R at the highest dose (20 mg/l). R was under all conditions more active than its active principle (G). Comparisons with results of earlier studies with lymphocytes and cells from internal organs indicate that epithelial cells are more susceptible to the cytotoxic and DNA-damaging properties of the herbicide and its formulation. Since we found genotoxic effects after short exposure to concentrations that correspond to a 450-fold dilution of spraying used in agriculture, our findings indicate that inhalation may cause DNA damage in exposed individuals.",2012,86,805,813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00204-012-0804-8

Pseudomonas putida shows enormous potential as biological control agent (BCA) not only because it is well reported to control a number of relevant crop diseases, but also because it has a short generation time, colonises plants and their environment, exerts its BCA activity through a range of different mechanisms, and promotes plant growth. Despite of these advantages no plant protection product based on P. putida is available in the market so far. In the present manuscript we describe the production of P. putida B2017, a novel biofungicide and biobactericide strain, at increasing scale - from laboratory (Erlenmeyer flasks) to pilot scale (125-L bioreactors) - as part of development process of a new commercial plant protection product. The technical grade active ingredient (TGAI) produced, regardless of the production scale, is as effective as the chemical reference against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in tomato, Rhizoctonia solani in potato, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in lettuce and Pectobacterium atrosepticum in potato. The TGAI titration obtained in 125-L bioreactors is high enough as to warrant effective TGAI concentration in a putative end-product even after typical viability losses expected during formulation. In summary, we hereby show that P. putida B2017 is a promising BCA not only because its efficacy against plant pathogens, but also because it can be produce at large scale.",2019,29,1053,1068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2019.1645304

Roundup Original (R) (RO) contains an isopropylamine glyphosate (GLY) salt containing the surfactant POEA, while Roundup Transorb R (R) (RTR) contains a potassium salt of GLY with unknown surfactants. Both contain different compositions of so-called inert ingredients, more toxic than glyphosate. Amphibian tadpoles often experience variations in O-2 availability in their aquatic habitats; an ability to tolerate hypoxia can condition their survival and fitness. We evaluated the impacts of sublethal concentrations of GLY (1 mg L-1), RO (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) and RTR (1 mg L-1 GLY a.e) on metabolic rate ((V)over dot O-2 - mLO(2) Kg1 h(-1)) of bullfrog tadpoles during normoxia and graded hypoxia, and related this to morphology of their skin, their major site of gas exchange. In control (CT) (V)over dot O-2 remained unaltered from normoxia until 40 mmHg, indicating a critical O-2 tension between 40 and 20 mmHg. GLY significantly reduced (V)over dot O-2, possibly due to epidermal hypertrophy, which increased O-2 diffusion distance to O-2 uptake. In contrast, RTR increased (V)over dot O-2 during hypoxia, indicating an influence of inert compounds and surfactants. (V)over dot O-2 of RO did not differ from CT, suggesting that any increase in (V)over dot O-2 caused by exposure was antagonized by epidermal hypertrophy. Indeed, all herbicides caused marked alterations in skin morphology, with cell and epithelium wall presenting hyperplasia or hypertrophy and chromatid rupture. In summary, GLY, RO and RTR exert different effects in bullfrog tadpoles, in particular the surfactants and inert compounds appear to influence oxygen uptake. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Where two or more active substances were applied together, their joint action was estimated using an additive dose model where the active substances had the same mode of action or a multiplicative survival model where the modes of action differed. By coupling the model with models of wheat canopy growth and foliar disease published previously, it was possible to estimate disease-induced yield loss for a prescribed fungicide programme. The difference in green canopy area and, hence, interception of photosynthetically active radiation between simulated undiseased and diseased (but treated) crop canopies was used to estimate yield loss. The model was tested against data front field experiments across a range of sites, seasons and wheat cultivars and was shown to predict the observed disease-induced yield loss with sufficient accuracy to support fungicide treatment decisions.

The effect of two preparations was evaluated: Sunspray 850 EC and Sunspray Ultra-Fine, in which the active substance is refined paraffin- based mineral oil. Preparations were applied at three concentrations: 1, 1.5, and 2%. Research plots were sprayed three times every 7 days. The first treatment was performed at the turn of the second and third decade of April. Starting from the beginning of May, observations of plant colonization by aphids were conducted every 14 days.

The oral administration of the entomopathogenic bacterium Brevibacillus laterosporus to caged poultry species allows the homogeneous incorporation of its active ingredients with fly breeding media. Feces from treated broilers or hens show toxicity against exposed fly adults and larvae. Insecticidal effects are concentration- dependent with a lethal median concentration (LC50) value of 1.34 x 10(8) and 0.61 x 10(8) spores/g of feces for adults and larvae, respectively. Manure toxicity against flies was maintained as long as chickens were fed a diet containing adequate concentrations of B. laterosporus spores. Toxicity significantly decreased after spore administration to birds was interrupted. When poultry diet contained 10(10) spores/g, mortality of flies reared on feces exceeded 80%.

This study quantified and compared the efficacy, economic costs and environmental risk profiles of a range of established, emerging, and recently registered pre-emergent herbicides across field trials in the Wet Tropics region of North Queensland. Several herbicides were effective on certain weed species, but lacked broad spectrum control. Better efficacy results from products with multiple active ingredients (i.e., imazapic-hexazinone) demonstrated the benefits of using mixtures of active ingredients to widen the spectrum of weed control efficacy. All tested pre-emergent herbicides behaved quite similarly in terms of their propensity for off-site movement in water (surface runoff losses generally >10% of active applied), with their losses largely driven by their application rate. Herbicides with lower application rates consistently contributed less to the total herbicide loads measured in surface runoff. Results demonstrated alternative choices from the more environmentally problematic herbicides (such as diuron) are available with effective alternative formulations providing between 4 and 29 times less risk than the traditional diuron-hexazinone 'full rate'. However, considerable challenges still face canegrowers in making cost-effective decisions on sustainable herbicide selection. Additional research and effective grower extension are required to address information gaps in issues such as specific weed control efficacy of alternative herbicides and potential blending of some herbicides for more effective broad spectrum weed control, while also minimising environmental risks.

To understand their mode of action, the comparative herbicidal and toxicological effects of glyphosate (G) alone and 14 of its formulations were studied in this work, as a model for pesticides. GBH are mixtures of water, with commonly 36-48% G claimed as the active principle. As with other pesticides, 10-20% of GBH consist of chemical formulants. We previously identified these by mass spectrometry and found them to be mainly families of petroleum-based oxidized molecules, such as POEA, and other contaminants. We exposed plants and human cells to the components of formulations, both mixed and separately, and measured toxicity and human cellular endocrine disruption below the direct toxicity experimentally measured threshold. G was only slightly toxic on plants at the recommended dilutions in agriculture, in contrast with the general belief. In the short term, the strong herbicidal and toxic properties of its formulations were exerted by the POEA formulant family alone. The toxic effects and endocrine disrupting properties of the formulations were mostly due to the formulants and not to G. In this work, we also identified by mass spectrometry the heavy metals arsenic, chromium, cobalt, lead and nickel, which are known to be toxic and endocrine disruptors, as contaminants in 22 pesticides, including 11 G-based ones. This could also explain some of the adverse effects of the pesticides. In in vivo chronic regulatory experiments that are used to establish the acceptable daily intakes of pesticides, G or other declared active ingredients in pesticides are assessed alone, without the formulants.

Eradication is made more problematic by widespread insecticide resistance, raising interest in alternative control products. Juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs) such as methoprene and hydroprene are relatively harmless to non-arthropods and have proved to be effective against other urban insect pests. Two JHA products (Gentrol (R) and Precor (R), Central Life Sciences, Schaumburg, IL) were tested for efficacy against various bed bug stages as direct spray and as dry residue using three bed bug strains. RESULTS: At 1x and 2x the label rate, Precor (R) [active ingredient (S)-methoprene] had no significant effect on the development or fecundity of bed bugs. At 2x the label rate, confinement to residues of Gentrol (R) [active ingredient (S)-hydroprene] had no significant effect, but residues at 3x and 10x the label rate caused a reduction in fecundity and impaired development. Field strains were more susceptible to the reproductive effects of (S)-hydroprene than a long-maintained laboratory strain. CONCLUSIONS: While JHAs are attractive alternatives for pest management because of their inherent safety and distinct mode of action, these JHA formulations would have little impact on bed bug populations without relabeling to allow for higher application rates.

In contrast, the additional components in pesticide formulations have been overlooked as potential threats. By testing an acute oral dose of the fungicide product Amistar, and equivalent doses of each individual co-formulant, we were able to measure the toxicity of the formulation and identify the ingredient responsible. We found that a co-formulant, alcohol ethoxylates, caused a range of damage to bumble bee health. Exposure to alcohol ethoxylates caused 30% mortality and a range of sublethal effects. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees consumed half as much sucrose as negative control bees over the course of the experiment and lost weight. Alcohol ethoxylates treated bees had significant melanisation of their midguts, evidence of gut damage. We suggest that this gut damage explains the reduction in appetite, weight loss and mortality, with bees dying from energy depletion.

Pesticides that target the larval stage (i.e., larvicides) are particularly useful for controlling mosquito populations as they strike at the source. Currently, Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (BTI) is a commonly used mosquito larvicide but some studies show signs of resistance development. DL-methionine is an essential amino acid that has mosquito larvicidal capabilities, while also having minimal negative effects on non-target organisms in laboratory experiments. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effect of these two larvicides individually and together at reducing mosquito survival. We found that while DL-methionine was more toxic to Anopheles quadrimaculatus than Aedes aegypti, the opposite was true for BTI. Additionally, when the combination was tested against An. quadrimaculatus larvae at higher concentrations the active ingredients were complementary and the effect was equal to both ingredients alone. However, the active ingredients were antagonistic when tested against Ae. aegypti larvae. These findings are important as they show the potential for DL-methionine and the combination of DL-methionine with BTI to be used as a larvicide against Anopheles mosquitoes, which are responsible for transmitting malaria. Mosquito larvicides can reduce mosquito populations at the source, potentially decreasing biting rates and pathogen transmission. However, there is a growing need for mosquito larvicides that are environmentally sustainable. Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (BTI) is a naturally occurring bacterium commonly used as a larvicide to manage mosquito populations. Methionine is an essential amino acid that has demonstrated toxic properties against larval mosquitoes in laboratory experiments, while having minimal effects on non-target organisms. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential for a novel combination larvicide by testing for compatibility between these two active ingredients. We began by determining the lethal concentration values (LCs) of BTI and DL-methionine against Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say and Aedes aegypti Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae. These bioassays were conducted in glass jars and mortality was observed 48 h post-treatment. We found that while DL-methionine was more toxic to An. quadrimaculatus than Ae. aegypti, the opposite was true for BTI. Then, we used these LCs to conduct bioassays with a combination of BTI and DL-methionine to determine the relationship between the two active ingredients when used against An. quadrimaculatus and Ae. aegypti larvae. The findings of this study demonstrate that BTI and DL-methionine have the potential to be complementary due to their additive properties at higher concentrations and effect levels when tested against An. quadrimaculatus. However, an antagonistic relationship was detected at the concentrations tested with Ae. aegypti. These results are encouraging and imply that a DL-methionine or BTI/DL-methionine combination larvicide could be used in management of Anopheles species.",2020,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects11120880

Sorption is a major process that can influence pesticide concentration in water, especially in ditches collecting surface and drainage waters. Batch experiments were used to determine sorption isotherms and Kd values for three herbicides on bed-sediment and leaves in decay that can be found in agricultural ditches. Adsorption was assessed after a 24 hour contact time with the herbicides isoproturon, diuron and diflufenican. Results revealed that adsorption is more important on dead leaves than on sediment. This can be explained by the high organic carbon content of the leaves (OC: 482 g/kg) compared with sediment (OC: 11.6 g/kg) and the relative hydrophobicities of the pesticides. Experimental design was carried out to investigate the effects of 4 parameters on herbicide sorption on sediment and leaves. The influence of bromide (used as a conservative tracer in parallel transfer experiment), initial sorbent moisture, herbicide form, i.e. active substance or formulation, and water nature has been tested. Within the parameter ranges investigated, the initial sorbent moisture and formulation were the most important factors influencing pesticide sorption on both sorbents.",2003,NA,175,183,NA

Formulants are declared as inert diluents but some are more toxic than glyphosate, such as the family of polyethoxylated alkylamines (POEA). We tested glyphosate alone, glyphosate-based herbicide formulations and POEA on the immature mouse Sertoli cell line (TM4), at concentrations ranging from environmental to agricultural-use levels. Our results show that formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides induce TM4 mitochondrial dysfunction (like glyphosate, but to a lesser extent), disruption of cell detoxification systems, lipid droplet accumulation and mortality at sub-agricultural doses. Formulants, especially those present in Glyphogan, are more deleterious than glyphosate and thus should be considered as active principles of these pesticides. Lipid droplet accumulation after acute exposure to POEA suggests the rapid penetration and accumulation of formulants, leading to mortality after 24 h. As Sertoli cells are essential for testicular development and normal onset of spermatogenesis, disturbance of their function by glyphosate-based herbicides could contribute to disruption of reproductive function demonstrated in mammals exposed to these pesticides at a pre-pubertal stage of development.",2018,52,14,22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tiv.2018.01.002

Constant usage of pesticides presents a burden for soil and causes a decrease in its health, including the negative effects on earthworms which are indicators for soil quality. The objective of this research was the assessment of the effects of two insecticides and two herbicides on the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Namely, the following active ingredients and respective commercial preparations were investigated: esfenvalerate (Sumialfa), thiacloprid (Calypso), dimethenamid-p (Frontier) and prosulfocarb (Filon). Lethal concentrations (48 h) of both active ingredient and commercial preparations were determined using the filter paper contact test. Results The results showed that Calypso and Frontier were significantly more toxic than the active ingredient. Therefore, all further measurements were performed after exposure of earthworms to the commercial preparations of the pesticides. Specifically, several enzymatic biomarkers and multixenobiotic resistance activity were assessed. Additionally, a fluorescence-based assay for the determination of oxidative stress was established. Significant changes were detected for catalase, carboxylesterase and multixenobiotic activities after 48-h exposures. Also, a significant change in oxidative stress parameters could be observed for both Calypso and Frontier. Conclusions The obtained results show that commercial preparations can be more toxic than the active ingredients, and the formulations being distributed in the environment can affect earthworms on a molecular level already after short exposures. This emphasizes the importance of a more integrated eco-toxicological assessment of commercial pesticide preparations not to underestimate their effects on the environment.",2021,33,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00455-5

This study examines the hypothesis that the organophosphate alternative, Rimon 0.83EC, can have consequences to honey bee health by combining newly acquired field residue data, laboratory bioassays, and colony level feeding studies. Following label rate applications of Rimon 0.83EC to apple trees, average residue concentrations of the active ingredient, novaluron, were found to be 3.38 ppm in tree-collected pollen. Residues of the major co-formulant in Rimon 0.83EC, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were below the limit of detection in the field, but a growth chamber study described here found that NMP can persist in pollen for up to 7 d with average concentrations of 69.3 ppm. Concurrent larval rearing studies found novaluron and NMP to be toxic to developing honey bees at doses as low as 100 ppb and 100 ppm, respectively. Nucleus colony feeding studies found that chronic exposure to Rimon 0.83EC at doses as low as 200 ppm (18.6 ppm novaluron) can result in interruptions to brood production that can last for up to 2 wk after exposure.

It also establishes a baseline for future comparisons and for trend assessments. Methods: The amounts of imported technical materials for formulation by local manufacturers as well as imported final product formulations were extracted from the registration data of the Plant Protection Organization of Iran in 2012-2014. The hazard indicators used were acute oral toxicity and chronic toxicity. For the latter, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and adverse effects on reproduction or development (CMR toxicity), and low Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) were used. The comparative potential of the active ingredients of concern in terms of chronic toxicity was assessed using the average annual volume of their estimated use divided by their respective ADI, called chronic hazard potential (CHP) in the present text. The contribution of individual pesticides in different use categories to the total CHP of the user category, was also calculated, using the average annual volume of the active ingredients of all pesticides used during the period 2012-2014. Results: On average about 14,000 tonnes of agriculture pesticides, expressed in active ingredients (AI), were annually used in Iran. Herbicides constituted the largest volume (43%), followed by insecticides and acaricides (37%) and fungicides (19%). 0.1% and 47% of the formulated products met the criteria of WHO Class Ib (highly hazardous) and Class II (moderately hazardous) products respectively. Aluminium phosphide and magnesium phosphide were identified as products of primary concern and chlorpyrifos, diazinon and paraquat as products of secondary concern, in terms of their acute human health hazard. No compound in carcinogenicity category 1A or 1B or germ cell mutagenicity/ reproduction toxicity category 1A was identified. Six compounds (diazinon, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, metam sodium, paraquat and dimethoate) were identified as products with chronic hazard potential based on a low ADI. Conclusions: The assessment identified and prioritized agriculture pesticide used in Iran in terms of their acute and chronic hazard to human health for re-registration scheme recently established by PPO and for risk mitigation. It also set priority for research into development of alternative products and practices to minimize pesticide risks. Chronic hazard potential - amount of use adjusted with toxicity may serve as a useful point of reference for trend analysis also in the use of less hazardous agricultural pesticide products.",2017,15,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40201-017-0272-4

We used a synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) that has been studied extensively as a consequence of its bioactivity and biocompatibility. An aggregation between HA nanoparticles and four Cu(II) compounds applied to Vitis vinifera L. leaves as a pesticide was studied. Formulations were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electron microscopy and applied in planta to verify particle aggregation and efficiency in controlling the pathogen Plasmopara viticola. RESULTSThe XRD patterns showed different crystalline phases dependig on the Cu(II) compound formulated with HA particles, DLS showed that nanostructured particles are stable as aggregates out of the nanometer range and, in all formulations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) microscopy showed large aggregates which were partially nanostructured and were recognized as stable in their micrometric dimensions. Such particles did not show phytotoxic effects after their application in planta. CONCLUSIONA formulation based on HA and a soluble Cu(II) compound showed promising results in the control of the fungal pathogen, confirming the potential role of HA as an innovative delivery system of Cu(II) ions. The present work indicates the possibility of improving the biological activity of a bioactive substance by modifying its structure through an achievable formulation with a biocompatible material.

The main loss pathways are vapor drift, direct volatilization, or leaching of the active substances. Consequently, the pesticide can either accumulate and/or undergo physicochemical transformations in the soil. In this scenario, we synthesized alginate nanoparticles using an inverse miniemulsion template in sunflower oil and successfully used them to encapsulate a hydrophilic herbicide, i.e., dicamba. The formulation and process conditions were adjusted to obtain a unimodal size distribution of nanohydrogels of about 20 nm. The loading of the nanoparticles with dicamba did not affect the nanohydrogel size nor the particle stability. The release of dicamba from the nanohydrogels was also tested: the alginate nanoparticles promoted the sustained and prolonged release of dicamba over ten days, demonstrating the potential of our preparation method to be employed for field application. The encapsulation of hydrophilic compounds inside our alginate nanoparticles could enable a more efficient use of pesticides, minimizing losses and thus environmental spreading.

There is, however, a recent trend for the cultivation of cycloxydim-tolerant maize hybrids for use in maize production. We studied the acute toxic effects of the complementary herbicide Focus(A (R)) Ultra and its active ingredient cycloxydim on embryos and early-stage larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). The results indicate that the herbicide formulation is significantly more toxic than the active ingredient alone. Therefore, it is suggested that the added substances either solely or in a synergistic action with the active ingredient are responsible for adverse effects. The formulation was found to be moderately toxic to embryos but highly toxic to early larvae. Based on calculated teratogenic indices, both cycloxydim and Focus(A (R)) Ultra seem to be non-teratogenic and also the minimum Focus(A (R)) Ultra concentration to inhibit growth in embryos and larvae was close to the LC50 values. The data suggest that tests with the rainbow trout are not in all cases appropriate to assess the risk in aquatically developing anurans. This is demonstrated by 96-h LC50 values, which are for rainbow trout more than 50- to 20-fold higher than for early X. laevis larvae. However, based on worst-case predicted environmental concentrations for surface waters, there is apparently a large safety margin in field use of Focus(A (R)) Ultra if buffer strips between the farm land and the amphibian habitats are regarded.",2015,94,412,418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-015-1474-z

To assess combined effects, glyphosate was applied in its pure form (glyphosate isopropylammonium salt) and in preparation Roundup Classic (R) formulated with polyethoxylated tallowamines (POEA). Standing and running surface water samples originated from Lake Balaton and River Danube between early May and mid-June of 2015. The kinetics of dissipation of glyphosate, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with UV-VIS absorbance detection or tandem mass spectrometry, was investigated under laboratory conditions in aquaria with or without the presence of biofilms. The quantity and the biofilm structure of algal biomass were determined by in vivo fluorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The presence of POEA affected the dissipation of glyphosate, and dissipation profiles differed in the investigated natural waters. Significantly higher initial concentrations of glyphosate were measured in River Danube for treatment with formulated glyphosate (101.4 +/- 6.2 mu g L-1), than with glyphosate alone (79.9 +/- 6.6 mu g L-1), and dissipation to a residual level (57.6 +/- 1.4 mu g L-1) consequently took longer (approximately by 1day). Degradation of glyphosate from the initial level (91.24 +/- 5.9 mu g L-1) in Lake Balaton was not detected. Phytotoxic effects of glyphosate, particularly if enhanced by a formulant on algal biomass, were observed. Thus, 5-18% and 11-33% of algal biomass reduction was determined in River Danube upon treatments with glyphosate and Roundup Classic (R), respectively. Corresponding biomass decreases in Lake Balaton were 1.3-13% and 9-14%, respectively, accompanied by an overall decay in the algal biofilms. In River Danube, treatments resulted in the occurrence of 1.4-5.8% of green algae in the algal biomass in 28days, while green algae were not detected in the untreated control.

Its common use results from the belief that it affects exclusively plants. However, studies on glyphosate and its trade formulations reveal that it causes numerous morphological, physiological and biochemical disturbances in cells and organisms of animals, including mammals. Due to the fact that shortly after oral exposure glyphosate is detected in the highest amount in small intestine, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this compound on the spontaneous motoric activity of intestine under in vitro conditions. The experiments were conducted on rat jejunum strips under isotonic conditions. The strips were incubated in buffered (pH 7.35) and non-buffered (pH 5.2) glyphosate solutions ranged from 0.003 to 1.7 g/L. The results indicate that glyphosate applied in buffered solution affects significantly the spontaneous motoric activity of rat isolated jejunum strips. The muscle response is biphasic (miorelaxation accompanied by contraction). The contraction is observed already at a dose of 0.003 g/L and the first significant biphasic reaction at a dose of 0.014 g/L. The incubation of jejunum strips with glyphosate in non-buffered solution (pH 5.2) results in a different reaction. The smooth muscle undergoes only persistent relaxation, which is stronger than the response to glyphosate solution in pH 7.35. Motility disturbances are also observed after glyphosate removal from the incubation solution. The gathered data suggests that glyphosate impairs gastrointestinal strips' motility at concentration that are noticed in human exposed to non-toxic doses of glyphosate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty different LAS-degrading bacteria were isolated from detergent-contaminated soil by enrichment culture technique and degradation efficiency was assessed by Methylene Blue Active Substances (MBAS) assay and by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The most efficient LAS-degrading isolates, L9 (81.33 +/- 0.7) and L12 (81.81 +/- 0.8), were selected and identified as Pseudomonas nitroreducens (MTCC 10463) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 10462).

Product approval is governed differently in these two sectors in the European Union (EU), and the occurrence of veterinary drug (VD) and pesticide residues indicated by contamination notification cases in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the EU also show characteristic differences. While the initial high numbers of VD residues reported in 2002 were successfully suppressed to less than 100 cases annually by 2006 and on, the number of notification cases for pesticide residues showed a gradual increase from a low (approximately 50 cases annually) initial level until 2005 to more than 250 cases annually after 2009, with a halt occurring only in 2016. Main notifiers of VD residues include Germany, Belgium, the UK, and Italy (63, 59, 42, and 31 notifications announced, respectively), and main consigning countries of non-compliances are Vietnam, India, China, and Brazil (88, 50, 34, and 23 notifications, respectively). Thus, countries of South and Southeast Asia are considered a vulnerable point with regard to VD residues entering the EU market. Unintended side effects of VDs and plant protection products may be caused not only by the active ingredients but also by various additives in these preparations. Adjuvants (e.g., surfactants) and other co-formulants used in therapeutic agents and feed additives, as well as in pesticide formulations have long been considered as inactive ingredients in the aspects of the required main biological effect of the pharmaceutical or pesticide, and in turn, legal regulations of the approval and marketing of these additives specified significantly less stringent risk assessment requirements, than those specified for the active ingredients. However, numerous studies have shown additive, synergistic, or antagonistic side effects between the active ingredients and their additives in formulated products; moreover, toxicity has been evidenced for various additives. Therefore, toxicological evaluation of surfactants and other additives is essential for proper environmental risk assessment of formulations used in agriculture including animal husbandry and plant protection.",2017,4,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2017.00146

However, studies on the effects of glyphosate-based formulations on terrestrial receptors are scarce. This study was conducted to evaluate the comparative toxicity of two glyphosate-based products: Roundup FG (monoammonium salt, 72% acid equivalent, glyphosate-A) and Mon 8750 (monoammonium salt, 85.4% acid equivalent, glyphosate-B), towards the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Median lethal concentration (LC50) showed that glyphosate-A was 4.5-fold more toxic than glyphosate-B. Sublethal concentrations caused a concentration-dependent weight loss, consistent with the reported effect of glyphosate as uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Glyphosate-A showed deleterious effects on DNA and lysosomal damage at concentrations close to the applied environmental concentrations (14.4 mu g ae cm(-2)). With glyphosate-B toxic effects were observed at higher doses, close to its LC50, suggesting that the higher toxicity of formulate A could be attributed to the effects of some of the so-called inert ingredients, either due to a direct intrinsic toxicity, or to an enhancement in the bioavailability and/or bioaccumulation of the active ingredient. Our results highlight the importance of ecotoxicological assessment not only of the active ingredients, but also of the different formulations usually employed in agricultural practices.

This very common disease occurs throughout olive-growing regions. Cultivars vary in their susceptibility, but all are subject to infection. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the disease may take several years to become serious enough to cause alarm. Leaves fall prematurely. When significant defoliation occurs, strong bloom fails to develop and crop production is substantially reduced. The most favorite formulations employed to fight against this disease are copper based product. However, the negative environmental effects of this heavy metal are quite a big concern leading to the search for new effective and environmentally friendly molecules. In this study, a new fungicide based on tetraconazole, an active principle with systemic action, was tested and compared to dodine and copper oxychloride. The trial was conducted during the years 2010-2012 in an olive grove of southern Italian with a Mediterranean climate. Two fungicide applications were performed each year. For each formulation employed, seven trees were treated. The disease severity on the leaves was affected by the type of fungicide used and the time of its exposure. From the comparison of control plants with the treated ones, the best results were obtained with dodine and copper oxychloride formulations. Overall, tetraconazole reduced the disease and, as a systemic action, may be associated with dodine or copper to control Spilocaea oleagina particularly when the disease is well developed.",2014,1057,185,189,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1057.22

Attempts have been made in lab settings to simulate field conditions in order to predict the extent and rate of elution of Al from granules into surrounding soil conditions, or to determine the rate at which the Al comes out of the granules. Although these techniques are helpful, they do not provide a quick and simple answer to whether or not the active ingredient comes out of the granules when a rain event is simulated. A simplified laboratory method for quantifying the released amount of the organophosphate terbufos into water from a granular carrier has been developed. The objective was to determine whether there was movement of the Al out of the granule when it was exposed to water. Water was added to the granules in a way that simulated a rain event, and the release of terbufos out of the granule was evaluated with both repeated elutions (open system) and single elution (closed system). The concentration of terbufos in the water was tested via liquid-liquid (LLS) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods. In a comparison of these two water extraction techniques, SPE proved to be more efficient than LLS and was chosen for testing samples. Three commercially available granular formulations were tested for the release of Al, and the results showed differences among the formulations. For both elution systems, repeated and single, a higher concentration of terbufos was found in water leached from granule A than from granules B and C. The difference may be attributed to the clay composition or the addition of co-formulants in the samples tested. Material reconciliation experiments were able to confirm the quantity of Al remaining in the granules after leaching.",2013,1558,139,149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP155820120065

Pesticides are thought to be important drivers of these declines. Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides and are broadly considered 'bee safe' by regulatory bodies who explicitly allow their application directly onto foraging bees. We aimed to test the mortality effects of spraying the world's most popular herbicide brand (Roundup(R)) directly onto bumble bees Bombus terrestris audax. We used three Roundup(R) products, the consumer products Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use and Roundup(R) No Glyphosate, the agricultural product Roundup(R) ProActive, as well as another herbicide with the same active ingredient (glyphosate), Weedol(R). Label recommended pesticide concentrations were applied to the bees using a Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use spray bottle. Bees exhibited 94% mortality with Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use(R) and 30% mortality with Roundup(R) ProActive(R), over 24 hr. Weedol(R) did not cause significant mortality, demonstrating that the active ingredient, glyphosate, is not the cause of the mortality. The 96% mortality caused by Roundup(R) No Glyphosate supports this conclusion. Dose-dependent mortality caused by Roundup(R) Ready-To-Use, further confirms its acute toxicity. Roundup(R) products caused comprehensive matting of bee body hair, suggesting that surfactants, or other co-formulants in the Roundup(R) products, may cause death by incapacitating the gas exchange system. These mortality results demonstrate that Roundup(R) products pose a significant hazard to bees, in both agricultural and urban systems, and that exposure of bees to them should be limited. Synthesis and applications. Surfactants, or other co-formulants, in herbicides and other pesticides may contribute to global bee declines. We recommend that, as a precautionary measure until co-formulant identities are made public, label guidelines for all pesticides be altered to explicitly prohibit application to plants when bees are likely to be foraging on them. As current regulatory topical exposure toxicity testing inadequately assesses toxicity of herbicide products, we call for pesticide companies to release the full list of ingredients for each pesticide formulation, as lack of access to this information hampers research to determine safe exposure levels for beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems.",2021,58,1167,1176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13867

On the contrary, frequent use of synthetic fungicides is undesirable in some cases and may be equally problematic. Moreover, the ever more increasing fungal resistance against commercial synthetic fungicides justifies development of rising efforts to seek new effective, while environmentally friendly alternatives. Botanical fungicides based on Essential oils (EOs) undoubtedly provide such an alternative. The study explores the efficacy of 20 EOs against Alternaria alternata, Stachybotrys chartarum, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Aspergillus niger, related to abundance of majority active substances. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC100 and MIC50) was evaluated. GC-MS analysis revealed high abundance of highly effective phenolic compounds whose different molecular structures correlates with differences in EOs efficacy. The efficacy of some EOs, observed in our study, can be similar to the levels of some synthetic fungicides used in medicine and agriculture e.g. sometimes problematic azole-based formulations. Thanks to the EOs environmental safety and natural origin, they offer the potential to become an alternative where the use of synthetic fungicides is impossible for various reasons.

However, little is known about their effects on the molecular mechanisms related to sperm quality. To investigate the effects of GLY and GA on mitochondrial respiration efficiency, we took advantage of our already established ex vivo human sperm mitochondria assay. Since spermatozoa are highly regulated by sex steroids, we tested at first testosterone (T), di-hydroxytestosterone (DHT), 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). Then, we tested the effects of GLY and GA and of the hormone-like flavonoid quercetin (QRC) in a dose-dependent manner.

Subsequently, co-incubation experiments were carried out with the two herbicides in the presence of 10 nM of each sex steroid and QRC. We found that: i) DHT and QRC are able to significantly reduce mitochondrial functionality at concentrations >= 10 nM; ii) GLY and GA negatively affect mitochondrial respiration efficiency; iii) in the presence of 10 nM DHT, the negative effect of GLY was increased; iiii) DHT, QRC and GA target mitochondria by using a mechanism different from GLY.",2021,99,48,55,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2020.11.011

Lack of disclosure of adjuvant and formulation ingredients coupled with a lack of adequate analytical methods constrains the assessment of total chemical load on beneficial organisms and the environment. Adjuvants generally enhance the pesticidal efficacy and inadvertently the non-target effects of the active ingredient. Spray adjuvants are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are not registered by the USA EPA, leaving their regulation and monitoring to individual states. Organosilicone surfactants are the most potent adjuvants and super-penetrants available to growers. Based on the data for agrochemical applications to almonds from California Department of Pesticide Regulation, there has been increasing use of adjuvants, particularly organosilicone surfactants, during bloom when two-thirds of USA honey bee colonies are present. Increased tank mixing of these with ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors and other fungicides and with insect growth regulator insecticides may be associated with recent USA honey bee declines. This database archives every application of a spray tank adjuvant with detail that is unprecedented globally.

This technique provides new insights since it provides both high (sub-micron) spatial resolution combined with the chemical specificity associated with organic mass spectrometry. The components studied include the oligomeric ethoxylate surfactants Synperonic A7 and A20 and active ingredient Sulfosate (trimesium glyphosate). The movement of these molecules, both separately and when combined in a simple formulation, into the surface of Prunus laurocerasus leaves and across the isolated plant cuticle was investigated and clear differences in penetration/diffusion behaviour were identified. ToF-SIMS was uniquely able to (simultaneously) spatially resolve all the species involved, including the anion and cation components of the active incredient. Also, using spectral reconstructions from the imaging raw data streams, the behaviour of individual oligomers within the surfactant distributions, could be assessed.

While generally toxic to phototrophs, organic phosphorus in glyphosate can become available to glyphosate-resistant phytoplankton and contribute to algal bloom development. Few studies have examined the effects of GBH on growth of eukaryotic microalgae and information for the toxic bloom-forming haptophyte, Prymnesium parvum, is limited. Using a batch-culture system, this study examined the effects on P. parvum growth of a single application of Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Super Concentrate Plus (R) (Roundup SC), Roundup Weed and Grass Killer Ready-to-Use III (R) (Roundup RtU), and technical-grade glyphosate at low concentrations [0-1000 mu g glyphosate acid equivalent (ae) l(-1)]. Roundup formulations differ in the percent of glyphosate as active ingredient (Roundup SC, similar to 50%; Roundup RtU, 2%), allowing indirect evaluation of the influence of inactive ingredients. Roundup SC enhanced exponential growth rate at 10-1000 mu g glyphosate ae l-1, and a positive monotonic association was noted between Roundup SC concentration and early (pre-exponential growth) but not maximum cell density. Glyphosate and both Roundup formulations enhanced growth rate at 100 mu g glyphosate l(-1), but only Roundup SC and glyphosate significantly stimulated early and maximum density. This observation suggests the higher concentration of inactive ingredients and other compounds in Roundup RtU partially counteracts glyphosate-dependent growth stimulation. When phosphate concentration was varied while maintaining other conditions constant, addition of Roundup SC and glyphosate at 100 mu g l(-1) influenced growth more strongly than equivalent changes in phosphate-associated phosphorus. It appears, therefore, that low doses of glyphosate stimulate growth by mechanisms unrelated to the associated small increases in total phosphorus. In conclusion, glyphosate and GBH stimulate P. parvum growth at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This finding raises concerns about the potential contribution to P. parvum blooms by glyphosate-contaminated runoff or by direct application of GBH to aquatic environments.",2018,80,130,139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2018.11.004

The acute toxicity of two commercial neem insecticides, Neemix, Azatin and the experimental insecticide, RH-9999 to D. pulex was investigated using traditional 48 hr concentration-mortality estimates. Neemix and Azatin were equitoxic with LC50s of 0.68 and 0.57 ppm; RH-9999 was significantly less toxic with an LC50 of 13 ppm. A 10 d population growth study was conducted for Neemix and a Neemix formulation blank (Neemix devoid of the active ingredients) to determine whether the active ingredients of Neemix and/or components of the formulation were responsible for toxicity. D. pulex populations went to extinction after exposure to a Neemix concentration of 0.45 ppm azadirachtin (equivalent to the acute LC7). Neemix No Observable Effect Concentration (NOEC) and Lowest Observable Effect Concentration (LOEC) values for population growth were 0.045 and 0.15 ppm azadirachtin, respectively.

The formulation blank caused no mortality in the individuals used to start the population growth study but reduced reproduction and population growth accounting for 47% of the toxicity caused by Neemix at a concentration of 0.15 ppm. Thus, the formulation contributes substantially to the toxicity of Neemix but neem components are also toxic to D. pulex. Because the NOEC for population growth and reproduction were higher than the estimated environmental concentration of 0.035 ppm (a measure developed for forest pest mananagement), Neemix should pose little risk to populations of D. pulex.",2001,36,457,465,http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/PFC-100104189

Bentazon is not readily adsorbed by soil and therefore it enters adjacent freshwater ecosystems, making its way to estuarine and marine waters areas. Information regarding its effects on marine ecosystems is scarce. Phytotoxicity assessments were conducted in the laboratory on the common diatom Chaetoceros gracilis using both the active ingredient and its formulated product (Basamais). The 3 day EC50 Using cell counts were, respectively, 150 mg/L and 60 mu g/L for bentazon active ingredient and for bentazon-formulated while cellular volume was increased. Although bentazon is known as a photosystem II inhibitor, it produced an increase of pigment (chlorophylls a, c, and carotenoids) content, ATP synthesis, rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and TBARS formation. Therefore, pigments cannot be used as biomarkers of toxicity.

Being of a perennial and monoculture nature in terms of its cultivation system, it provides a stable micro-climate for various insect pests, which cause substantial loss of crop. With the escalating cost of insect pest management and increasing concern about the adverse effects of the pesticide residues in manufactured tea, there is an urgent need to explore other avenues for pest management strategies. Aim: Integrated pest management (IPM) in tea invites an multidisciplinary approach owing to the high pest diversity in the perennial tea plantation system. In this review, we have highlighted current developments of nanotechnology for crop protection and the prospects of nanoparticles (NPs) in plant protection, emphasizing the control of different major pests of tea plantations. Methods: A literature search was performed using the ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar search engines with the following terms: nanotechnology, nanopesticides, tea, and insect pest. An article search concentrated on developments after 1988. Results: We have described the impact of various pests in tea production and innovative approaches on the use of various biosynthesized and syntheric nanopesticides against specific insect pest targets. Simultaneously, we have provided support for NP-based technology and their different categories that are currently employed for the management of pests in different agro-ecosystems. Besides the broad categories of active ingredients (AI) of synthetic insecticides, pheromones and natural resource-based molecules have pesticidal activity and can also be used with NPs as a carriers as alternatives to traditional pest control agents. Finally, the merits and demerits of incorporating NP-based nanopesticides are also illustrated. Conclusions: Nanopesticides for plant protection is an emerging research field, and it offers new methods to design active ingredients amid nanoscale dimensions. Nanopesticide-based formulations have a potential and bright future for the development of more effective and safer pesticide/biopesticides.",2021,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.686131

The active ingredient can be either solid or liquid. Additional actives and/or adjuvants can be dissolved or suspended in the formulation if desired. The main advantage of an SSF over standard formulation alternatives is that no thickening or suspending agents are required. The SSF formulation can be solvent-free if desired, or include an oil adjuvant. A brief introduction on surfactant phase behavior will be presented as background material. When the surfactant loading in aqueous solutions reaches high levels the surfactants begin to associate in liquid crystalline phases. Liquid crystalline phases can also be formed at low surfactant concentration by a technique known as salting out. This phase behavior can be exploited by suspending dispersions of pesticide active ingredients using economical levels of surfactant. A typical SSF contains from 0-60 w/w% active, surfactants for wetting and dispersing as well as structuring, and finally antifreeze and antifoam, if required. The typical properties of an SSF are excellent concentrate physical stability, relatively low viscosity (after the yield stress is overcome), good storage stability, good wetting, and the ability to form stable suspensions on dilution in the spray tank. SSF technology can be applied to a wide range of pesticide materials, including herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. The development of an herbicide SSF is presented that demonstrates how surfactant chemistry can be used to optimize the formulation efficacy. Combination packs that include both water-soluble and water-insoluble actives are also presented.

As this ant remains at the early invasion stage, efforts in establishing a rapid-response framework, such as evaluating available control methods, are urgently needed. Despite the presence of numerous household insecticides against invasive/household pest ants in Japan, the effects of these products on fire ants remain poorly understood. This study assessed the efficacy of two bait products designed to target common household ant pests in Japan on S. invicta through under laboratory and field conditions in Taiwan. The two baits are Arino-su-korori (AK), a granule-formulated bait product with hydramethylnon as an active ingredient (A.I.), and Hyper Arino-su-korori (HAK), a paste-formulated bait with fipronil as A.I., respectively. We showed that both AK and HAK resulted in more than 99% mortalities of fire ant within 8 wk under laboratory conditions and significantly reduce fire ants' foraging activities in the field. AK generally performed slightly better than HAK in terms of the time required to achieve total laboratory colony elimination and also long-term suppression of field fire ants. Such differences most likely are attributable to the active ingredient's mode of action and/or formulation and their interactions with fire ant biology. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the two bait products in effectively controlling laboratory and field fire ants, thus representing a promising candidate pest management tool to cope with ongoing/future fire ant invasions in Japan.",2022,115,624,630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab255

The kasugamycin was connected with amino-modified silica matrix by an amide bond, which could avoid the initial burst release effectively and prolong the duration remarkably. The results showed the kasuga-silica can protect kasugamycin against photo-degradation effectively and the release rate of the active ingredient of nanoconjugate was related to the temperature, pH value, and the particle size (52.5-315.4 nm). With reduced particle size as well as increased temperature and acidity, the release of the active ingredient was faster. This amide linkage of kasuga-silica could be degraded by amidase effectively.

We identified the most commonly used POEA, known as POE-15 tallow amine (POE-15), in the widely used US GBH RangerPro. Cytotoxicity assays using human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 and hepatocyte HepG2 cell lines showed that RangerPro and POE-15 are far more cytotoxic than glyphosate alone. RangerPro and POE-15 but not glyphosate caused cell necrosis in both cell lines, and that glyphosate and RangerPro but not POE-15 caused oxidative stress in HepG2 cells. We further tested these pesticide ingredients in the ToxTracker assay, a system used to evaluate a compound's carcinogenic potential, to assess their capability for inducing DNA damage, oxidative stress and an unfolded protein response (endoplasmic reticulum, ER stress). RangerPro and POE-15 but not glyphosate gave rise to ER stress. We conclude that the toxicity resulting from RangerPro exposure is thus multifactorial involving ER stress caused by POE-15 along with oxidative stress caused by glyphosate.

However, the modifying effect of co-ingredients on skin uptake and glove barrier protection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to understand the role of formulation co-ingredients in skin and glove barrier protection performance against organophosphate insecticides. RESULTS We adapted standard in vitro diffusion cell methods to test permeation kinetics of two commonly used organophosphate insecticides: dimethoate and omethoate. For spray dilutions, dimethoate and omethoate did not reach breakthrough glove permeation rate (1 mu g center dot cm(-2)center dot min(-1)) and no or little skin permeation was observed for up to 8 h, regardless of formulation. For exposure conditions involving highly concentrated products, significant differences in glove permeation were observed between different formulations of dimethoate (about 1.5-fold, P < 0.05) and of omethoate (184-fold, P < 0.001). In contrast, no difference (P > 0.05) was observed between formulations in terms of skin permeation. CONCLUSION These results suggest that co-ingredients play a critical role in glove barrier protection against undiluted organophosphate insecticides, whereas their influence on skin uptake was insignificant within the exposure time tested. This implies that dermal exposure risk may vary between handling different formulated products of the same active ingredient hence recommending a common glove material for different formulations of the same chemical without careful consideration of co-ingredients and their permeation properties may not necessarily be appropriate.",2022,78,177,183,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6621

The spray application process can be viewed as a series of interdependent events, namely formulation, atomization, spray transfer and interaction with the plant surface leading to retention and penetration. Adjuvants play a role in each event for they are used extensively in formulation and as a tank mix during application. They facilitate solubilzation of the active ingredient and modify the physico-chemical properties of the spray solution. The size distribution of the spray may be shifted to a lower or higher VMD by surfactants and drift retardants, respectively. Spray retention and spreading are increased on difficult to wet plant surfaces. Foliar penetration can be increased by stomatal pore infiltration by surfactants that lower surface tension to < 30 mN m(-1). Transcuticular penetration may be depressed by adjuvants that do not penetrate, but reside on the surface, in the spray droplet residue and solubilize/complex the agrochemical in micelles (or other momomer agregrates) and effectively reducing the driving force. Other surfactants penetrate into the cuticle and plasticize the waxes, leading to increased transcuticular diffusion of the active ingredient.

In the toxicity assays with A. cepa, the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles mitigated the increase in the DNA relative damage index caused by the neem oil. Molecular genetic analysis of the soil nitrogen cycle microbiota revealed that neem oilloaded zein nanoparticles did not change the number of genes which encode nitrogen-fixing enzymes and denitrifying enzymes. In C. elegans, the neem oil-loaded win nanoparticles had no toxic effect, while neem oil interfered with pharyngeal pumping and GST-4 protein expression. These neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles showed promising results in the toxicity studies, opening perspectives for its use in crop protection in organic agriculture. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Since aquatic and terrestrial stages of amphibians can be exposed to these substances, adverse effects cannot be excluded. We investigated acute aquatic and terrestrial effects of the herbicide formulation Focus (R) Ultra, its active substance cycloxydim, its co-formulants solvent naphtha and docusate as well as the stabilizing adjuvant Dash (R) E.C. on larval and juvenile Rana temporaria. Aquatic toxicity was determined as 96-h LC50 values. Cycloxydim was the least toxic and solvent naphtha the most toxic substance of the formulation. The addition of Dash (R) E.C. increased the formulation toxicity substantially. Terrestrial toxicity was determined as lethal effects after a 48-h exposure to contaminated soil with 100% of the recommended field rate (FR) and as sublethal effects after the exposure to 10% of the recommended FR. The exposure to solvent naphtha and docusate at 100% FR led tomortalities of 42-100% probably due to their inhalation toxicity and dermal as well as eye irritation, respectively. Cycloxydim, Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. did not lead to any mortality. Sublethal effects on juvenile locomotor activity (i.e. moved distance) were observed for cycloxydim and the combined exposure of Focus (R) Ultra and Dash (R) E.C. Juvenile body masses declined significantly for all substances except for cycloxydim. The present results show that aquatic sensitivity does not predict terrestrial sensitivity. It was shown that pesticide toxicity for amphibians can highly depend on the presence and amount of co-formulants and added adjuvants. Therefore, substances included in pesticide formulations which are known to be toxic by inhalation or harmful to eyes or skin should be specifically considered in the environmental risk assessment for amphibians.

Nanosized encapsulated pesticides offer a variety of enhanced features including controlled release and improved efficacy. Despite the presence of nanosized capsules in current-use pesticide formulations, the analytical and toxicological implications of encapsulation are uncertain. To explore this issue quantitatively, we fractionated the capsules of a commercially available encapsulated insecticide formulation (gamma-cyhalothrin active ingredient) into two size ranges: a large fraction (LF), with an average hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) of 758 nm, and a small fraction (SF), with an average HDD of 449 nm. We developed a novel extraction method demonstrating a time-dependent inhibition of gamma-cyhalothrin from capsules for up to 48 h. An acute immobilization test with a freshwater macroinvertebrate (Ceriodaphnia dubia) revealed that the SF was significantly more toxic than both the LF and the free gamma-cyhalothrin treatment (EC50 = 0.18 mu g/L, 0.57 mu g/L, and 0.65 mu g/L, respectively). These findings highlight that encapsulation of gamma-cyhalothrin mitigates hydrophobic partitioning in a time-dependent manner and influences toxicity in a size-dependent manner.

This study proposed a pragmatic approach based on widely accepted scientific concepts and strategies. RESULTS The proposed approach has three tiers, a preliminary Tier 0 stage, a Tier 1 stage, and a refinement stage as Tier 2, which are demonstrated with one case study. Because of the large number of co-formulated pesticide mixtures available in China, a unique Tier 0 stage is proposed with practicable criteria to identify mixtures requiring further evaluation. For Tier-1 assessment, exposure is assessed based on the application scheme and local scenarios in China. Hazard is evaluated using the concentration addition model as the default approach, which was developed a century ago and was adopted by the majority of the regulators globally. Given the unique characteristics of mixtures in the environment, data variability and ratio changes of active ingredients are also evaluated for hazard assessment. More accurate assessments with decreased uncertainties can be achieved by higher tier refinements in Tier-2, such as alternative models, consideration of co-formulants, and higher tier effect and exposure analyses. CONCLUSION Widely accepted concepts, methodologies, and criteria should be used for aquatic risk assessment for pesticide mixtures in China. To avoid unnecessary workload and a more accurate assessment, unique perspectives such as local agricultural practice, local scenarios and a preliminary screening stage (Tier 0) should be implemented.

Human from its origin on earth depend upon plants for its food, clothing and shelter. But with the advancement in agriculture, plants are subjected to various diseases caused by microorganisms like pathogenic fungi, bacteria, nematodes and viruses. The use of chemical pesticides for controlling plant pathogens is very old and still in use presently. But, phytotoxicity (plant injury) may occur even when pesticides are routinely applied under the normal conditions, which can results in a variety of common symptoms like chlorosis, necrosis or burning. Burning can occur on leaf tips, margins, interveinal tissue or simply scattered across the leaf surface. Due to rise in toxicity and harmful effects of the use of chemical pesticides on grower and consumer's health and emergence of resistance in pathogens, the search for alternative to chemical control of plant pathogens, such as botanicals, biological and physical control has gained momentum in the recent years. Present article deals with the phytoextracts and their role as safe remedy in controlling plant diseases. Generally, plants produces many secondary metabolites e.g. tannins, alkaloids and flavonoids, which constitutes an important source of pesticides and many pharmaceutical drugs. As these plant extracts are biologically based, hence can be considered as environmental safe alternatives. Thus plant products and biocontrol agents can be well exploited in future and the active principles from the plant extract can also be isolated and formulated for the effective management of various plant diseases. This shift in universal trend from synthetic to herbal, or in other words chemicals to natural herbal products, has been reported as 'Return to Nature'.",2011,31,225,244,NA

Here, we further develop these models to include lipophilic adjuvant effects, as well as the adsorption and desorption, of compounds on the cuticle surface with a novel Adaptive Competitive Langmuir model. These modifications to a penetration model provide a novel addition to the literature.

Primary producers (phytoplankton), zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates were monitored for up to 93 days following treatment. Thiamethoxam was observed to have a water column dissipation half-life (DT50) of <= 1.6-5.2 days in the mesocosms. Community-based principal response curve analysis detected no treatment effects for phytoplankton, zooplankton, emergent insects, and macroinvertebrates, indicating a lack of direct and indirect effects. A number of statistically significant differences from controls were detected for individual phytoplankton and zooplankton species abundances, but these were not considered to be treatment-related due to their transient nature and lack of concentration-response. After application of 30 mu g a.s./L, slight temporary effects on Asellus aquaticus could not be excluded. At 100 mu g a.s./L, there was an effect with no clear recovery of Asellus observed, likely due to their inability to recolonize these isolated test systems. A statistically significant but transient reduction in the emergence of chironomids by day 23 at the 100 mu g a.s./L treatment was observed and possibly related to direct toxicity from thiamethoxam on larval stages. Therefore, a conservative study specific No Observed Ecological Adverse Effect Concentration (NOEAEC) is proposed to be 30 mu g a.s./L. Overall, based on current concentrations of thiamethoxam detected in North American surface waters (typically <0.4 mu g/L), there is low likelihood of direct or indirect effects from a pulsed exposure on primary producers, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates, including insects, as monitored in this study.

Our objective was to determine whether horizontal transfer can go beyond secondary, to tertiary and quaternary effects, and to compare various gel baits with different active ingredients. We fed adult females a bait and recorded their bait consumption, moribundity, and mortality. Groups of first instars were then exposed to the dead females and their feces, secondary mortality was quantified, and a new cohort of nymphs was then exposed to the feces and dead nymphs (for tertiary mortality); this process was repeated for quaternary mortality. This design did not distinguish among the major mechanisms of horizontal transfer of insecticides, namely coprophagy and contact with feces, exposure to regurgitated fluids, and cannibalism and necrophagy of nymphs. All the tested baits caused 100% mortality of the adult females that directly fed on the bait and high secondary mortality (average of >85%) within 48 hr.

Effluents before and after the treatment were analyzed according to requirements of the Polish Standards that included pH, color threshold, COD and concentration of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Ozonation was carried out in a lab-scale bubble column reactor with a centrally located UV burner. The most effective version of AOPs proved to be the simultaneous use of all three agents. In the case of such treatment of dyeing wastewaters nearly complete discoloration and full decomposition of surface-active substances were obtained at 80% reduction of COD. A similar tendency was observed in the case of laundering wastewater, though in that case the results were slightly worse, which may be explained by much higher initial concentrations of the pollutants.

Essential oils offer an attractive alternative to the use of synthetic chemicals for the control of varroa. Amongst them, thymol appears to be particularly promising. However, treatments using thymol as their active substance, such as the gel formulation Apiguard(R), are suspected to have adverse effects on honey bee colonies. In this study, laboratory assays are used to investigate the effects of Apiguard(R) exposure on honey bee behaviour. Our results reveal that honey bee responses to this anti-varroa treatment change with honey bee age. While 2-day-old bees respond neutrally to Apiguard(R), older bees generally avoid the Apiguard(R) gel. Responses of forager bees were particularly striking. Foragers appear to be repelled by Apiguard(R). Touching their antennae with Apiguard(R) induces robust fanning behaviour. Our data suggest, however, that forager bees exposed to Apiguard(R) in the hive can become habituated to this treatment.

Methods: Using a reported in vitro killing assay to measure the survival time of adult Demodex folliculorum up to 150 minutes, we have screened serial concentrations of 13 of the 15 known ingredients of TTO (ISO4730: 2004) that were soluble in mineral oil and examined their synergistic relationships in killing mites. The most potent ingredient was then tested for its efficacy in killing Demodex in vivo. Results: All ingredients exhibited a dose-dependent killing effect. Besides Terpinen-4ol, the order of relative potency did not correlate with the order of relative abundance in TTO for the remaining 12 ingredients. Terpinen-4-ol was the most potent ingredient followed by a-Terpineol, 1,8-Cineole and Sabinene. Terpinen-4-ol, the most abundant ingredient in TTO, was more potent than TTO at equivalent concentrations and its killing effect was even observable at a mere concentration of 1%. Terpinen-4-ol exhibited a significant synergistic effect with Terpinolene, but an antagonistic effect with a-Terpineol in killing mites (both P<0.05). In vivo, Terpinen-4-ol was shown to eradicate mites. Conclusions: The above finding suggests that deployment of Terpinen-4-ol alone should enhance its potency in killing Demodex mites by reducing the adverse and antagonistic effects from other ingredients in TTO. Translational Relevance: Terpinen-4-ol can be adopted in future formulations of acaricides to treat a number of ocular and cutaneous diseases caused by demodicosis.",2013,2,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/tvst.2.7.2

Based on these models, it was possible to predict the action pre-harvest interval (the time between the last pesticide application and crop harvest) needed to attain a targeted action threshold (value significantly lower than the maximum limit) for low-residue vegetable production. In addition, it was possible to determine an action pre-harvest interval based on an action threshold of 0.01 mg kg(-1) to produce vegetables intended for zero-residue production. The highest amount of pesticide residues were found in carrot and parsley leaves several days after treatment, and pesticide dissipation was generally slow.

The influence of storage time on cypermethrin migration to and through the PET was studied in short-term Collaborative International Pesticides Analytical Council test lasting up to 30 days. The PET containers were filled with pure xylene and pesticide formulations, where the amount of active substance, cypermethrin (CY), varied from 5 to 20 wt%, while the amount of emulsifier was kept constant.

Pregnant women may be frequently exposed to R compounds. These are composed of G, which is declared as the active principle, and other products contained in formulations, named formulants, which have been declared as inerts and diluents by the manufacturers. These formulants have, in fact, been demonstrated to be much more toxic than G, in particular to placental and embryonic human cells. In this work, we thus compared the effect of G and a GT+ formulation named R, using placental perfusion ex vivo. R, but not G alone, was demonstrated to alter the placental permeability of a known small model molecule, antipyrine. Similar results were observed for the fetal venous flow rate. The transfer of G alone increases with time, but is significantly decreased in presence of its formulants. The perfusion of R provokes a destruction of fetal vessels, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Formulants obviously alter the fetal-placental circulation and placental integrity according to time of exposure. Therefore, G does not appear to be the main toxic agent of R. Formulants, although undeclared, include polyoxyethanolamines, PAHs, or heavy metals, and may be responsible for this toxicity. These compounds are also present in other pesticides. The progressive blood flow reduction due to the toxic compounds of formulations may diminish the nutrient supply to the fetus, alter the development, and may enhance the poisoning effects. Although these are preliminary results, they could at least partially explain some adverse pregnancy outcomes in mothers exposed to pesticides or other environmental pollutants.

An adjuvant, Cosmo-Flux F411, and water also are added to the spray mixture before application. Aquatic ecosystems adjacent to the target coca fields might be exposed to the spray mix, placing aquatic organisms at risk. Because no toxicity data were available for spray mixture on aquatic organisms, acute toxicity tests were conducted on aquatic plants, invertebrates, and fish, by using the Cuspide 480SL spray mix as described on the label. Based on the median effective concentration (EC50) values for similar organisms, the spray mixture was less toxic to aquatic organisms than formulations previously used for the control of coca (i.e., Roundup-SL, Fuete-SL, and Gly-41).

The above substances, with low environmental impact, were compared with a conventional control treatment ('Conv') that used conventional active substances (penconazole, myclobutanil, azoxystrobin and sulfur) and an untreated control. Laboratory analyses conducted on leaves infected by powdery mildew showed that Golovinomyces cichoracearum was responsible for the disease. The conventional treatment was the most effective for containing powdery mildew, if compared to the untreated control, and it positively influenced the yield and fruit quality of all tested melon cultivars. Between the two natural products, 'TREXP001' was more effective; even if its efficiency, more evident in the first year, was significantly lower than 'Conv' treatment. The type of melon cultivar was an important factor for limiting the spread of the pathogen, especially in the early stages of cultivation. The 'Fonzy' cultivar, due to its shorter crop cycle, was attacked later in the season and sustained lower damages than the other two cultivars.

It is based on methodological articulation that included: a) systematic review of the reference literature on the research topic; b) analysis of related legislation (veterinary products and pesticides); c) risk identification regarding the use of veterinary products formulated using active ingredients listed as pesticides; d) and risk perception analysis of a group of dairy production workers. Results indicate a situation of particular interest to Public Health. Regarding dairy production workers, the invisibility of risks associated with handling pesticides for veterinary use, increases their exposure and is related to several health problems, especially for women. This same invisibility leads to a neglect of the prohibition period between pesticide use and consumption of other products. Part of the problem may be associated with the non-classification of pesticides for veterinary use as 'pesticides' (they are classified as veterinary products), which highlights the importance and the urgency of discussion of the theme.",2012,17,311,325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-81232012000200006

Pesticides reactivity towards light is rarely considered at the leaf surface after crop treatment although it is directly impacting the pesticide efficiency. We have established a test on thin wax films which mimic well the leaf surface. Under simulated solar light herbicides mesotrione and nicosulfuron as well as their mixture are photoreactive. For both herbicides considered separately, there is a strong accelerating effect of adjuvants compared to the pure active ingredient. Mesotrione, a triketonic herbicide was very reactive with a half-life of photolysis of 2 h. Nicosulfuron, a sulfonylurea, has a half-life of photolysis of 32 h. The mixing of the two formulated herbicides had an accelerating effect on both herbicide decay rates. The products formed when considering the pure molecule were mainly the result of photohydrolysis, oxidation and cyclisation. While pesticide photostability on crops is not evaluated for registration, this study demonstrates that these photochemical tests could be useful to improve the pesticide effectiveness and reduce the applied dose.

Neonicotinoid pesticides, introduced in the 1990s for several crops, are the leading products for seed-coating treatments in many countries. Neonicotinoid containing dusts can be effectively intercepted by bees in flight over the sowing field, inducing lethal acute effects, so that restrictions in the use of the main neonicotinoids have been adopted in the European Union. This led to the consequent introduction of replacement insecticides for seed-coating, i.e. methiocarb and thiacloprid, despite the lack of information on both the toxicity and the exposure scenarios for honeybees. Results In this study, a laboratory apparatus was developed in order to quantify the toxicity of the dusts produced from the abrasion of the seed coating. This quantification is based on (i) an airstream transporting coating particles into an exposure chamber; (ii) exposure of bees to reproducible and measurable concentrations of insecticide, and (iii) direct measurement of the exposure dose on single bees. The method allowed us to perform in vivo experiments of honeybee exposure to provide toxicity data in more realistic exposure conditions. In fact, the formulation rather than the active principle alone can be tested, and the exposure is through dusts rather than a solution so that specific absorption behavior can be studied in representative environmental conditions. The method was used to quantify the acute toxicity (LD50) of dusts obtained from the abrasion of corn seeds coated with clothianidin, thiacloprid and methiocarb. Conclusions Our results show that, surprisingly, the replacement insecticide methiocarb has a toxicity (LD50 = 421-693 ng/bee) in the same order of magnitude as clothianidin (LD50 = 113-451 ng/bee) through this specific exposure route, while thiacloprid (LD50 = 16.9 center dot 10(3) ng/bee) has a significantly lower acute toxicity. Moreover, dusts containing methiocarb and clothianidin show a significant increase in toxicity when, after exposure, bees are kept under high humidity conditions. This suggests that the method here presented can be used to obtain complementary toxicity data in the risk assessment procedure for the authorization of new seed-coating insecticides or new formulations.",2020,32,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-020-00372-z

Claims of superior efficacy, lower costs, improved sustainabilityetc.relative to conventional practices have been made. The promises, however, are not always fully substantiated, and thus may even prove counter-productive. Considering the shifts in drivers for the development of nano-enabled solutions, regulatory and public perception and to geographical discrepancies in terms food production, we reflect on how the proposed nano-enabled solutions are likely to meet the need in the global agricultural context. The potential of nanotechnology to reduce undernourishment and food insecurity at the global scale remains largely uncertain. Nanotechnology needs to align with the unique needs of emerging economies, where the scope of improvements are large but challenges abound. Regulatory requirements under development are extremely stringent for nanoformulations as the fate and hazard of different components (i.e.active substance, co-formulants and other adjuvants) need to be considered individually as well as together, which is typically not required for conventional agrochemicals. Organic nanocarriers are particularly difficult to track in food and environment and it is not always clear how regulatory requirements may be fulfilled. From our perspective, less focus should be placed on trying to define a clear boundary between nanovs.non-nano as it may slow down the uptake of innovations that will improve agrochemicals. More work is also needed to successfully design and synthesise materials that can outperform current agrochemicals through molecular-level tuning of properties. New approaches suitable for life cycle assessments of both nano and conventional agrochemicals are needed to support comparative evaluations.

The carrier is a dominant factor affecting the performance of the preparation. In this work, a copper-based fungicide is developed using plant sporopollenin materials as a control release carrier. Although sporopollenin is regarded as the toughest natural material, sporopollenin was broken down into nano- and micro-particles along with the modified surface chemistry by a facile oxidation treatment. The surface chemistry of sporopollenin is characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and Boehm titration. The resulting ultrafine sporopollenin particles (USPs) show a high copper(II) loading capacity of 435 mg/g, owing to the electrostatic effect. Furthermore, copper(II) can be released from copper(II)-sporopollenin complex (Cu-USPs) in a pH-dependent manner. As a proof of concept, Cu-USPs show very promising activity against a plant-specific pathogen-Pectobacterium carotovorum.

The microscope uses a chromatically fixed (1560 nm) femtosecond fiber laser, a commercial 2D galvanometer mirror system, and a PCIe digital oscilloscope card, which together kept total instrument costs under $40 000 (USD), a significant decrease in cost and complexity from common systems (commercial and homebuilt) using tunable lasers and faster beam-scanning architectures.

Crystallization was also followed in real-time, with differences in crystallization time observed for different application procedures (spraying vs single droplet deposition). A strong dependency of active ingredient crystallization on the substrate was found, with an increased crystallization tendency observed on leaves vs on glass slides. Different crystal habits for the same active ingredient were also observed on different plant species.

The major drawbacks of commercial herbicidal formulations include the necessity to incorporate toxic surfactants and high volatility of active substances. Transformation of herbicides into herbicidal ionic liquids (HILs) seems to be a promising alternative which allows to almost completely reduce volatility due to ionic interactions. In the scope of this research, we transformed (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)acetic acid (MCPA) into a quaternary ester (esterquat) with the use of derivatives of 2-dimethylaminoethanol. The obtained esterquats were later coupled with (+/-)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid (MCPP) in the form of an anion. The combination of MCPA and MCPA is commonly applied in the UK, EU countries and also in the USA to increase the spectrum of targeted weed species. In the framework of this study, novel HILs with an esterquat moiety incorporating a long alkyl chain (C-8, C-9, C-10, C-11, C-12, C-14) were prepared and characterized in terms of basic physicochemical properties (solubility and volatility) as well as biodegradability. Their phytotoxicity was assessed towards cornflower (Centaurea cyanus) as a model weed and maize (Zea mays) as a crop plant. The presence of the esterquat cation contributed to satisfactory solubility in water and other low polar solvents, which eliminates the need to add exogenous adjuvants. Further experiments indicated that the tested HILs stimulated the germination stage of maize and maintained high herbicidal activity towards cornflower. No significant differences in terms of properties were observed in case of HILs which included alkyl substituents with an odd number of carbon atoms.

Roundup stimulates succinate-supported respiration twice, with simultaneous collapse of transmembrane electrical potential, while glyphosate used in the same concentrations does not induce any significant effect. Additionally, Roundup depresses state 3 respiration by about 40%, at 15 mM, whereas uncoupled respiration in the presence of FCCP is depressed by about 50%. Depression of uncoupled respiratory activity is mediated through partial inhibition of mitochondrial complexes II and III, but not of complex IV. The phosphorylative system was affected by both a direct and an indirect effect on the F0F1 ATPase activity. The addition of uncoupled concentrations of Roundup to Ca2+-loaded mitochondria treated with Ruthenium Red resulted in non-specific membrane permeabilization, as evidenced by mitochondrial swelling in isosmotic sucrose medium. Therefore, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is also related to the non-specific membrane permeabilization induced by Roundup. Glyphosate alone does not show any relevant effect on the mitochondrial bioenergetics, in opposition to Roundup formulation products. The differences in the toxicity observed could be either attributed to some products of Roundup or to a synergic effect of glyphosate and formulation products. Bearing in mind that mitochondria is provided with a variety of bioenergetic functions mandatory for the regulation of intracellular aerobic energy production and electrolyte homeostasis, these results question the safety of Roundup on animal health.

Results were compared with those of two conventional acaricides benzyl benzoate and N,N- diethyl-3- methylbenzamide.

Citral (24 h LC50, 1.13 mu g/cm(2)) and menthol (1.69 mu g/cm(2)) were the most toxic compounds, followed by methyl eugenol (5.78 mu g/cm(2)).

Interestingly, the sesquiterpenoid alpha-humulene, lacking only the carbonyl group present in zerumbone, was significantly less effective than zerumbone, indicating that the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group of zerumbone is a prerequisite component for toxicity. These compounds were consistently more toxic in closed versus open containers, indicating that their mode of delivery was largely a result of vapor action.

The complex system development of the consumer food market, in addition to the economic aspect, covers the issues of public health, demography, effective nature management, resource saving and ecology. The current scientific approaches in the field of healthy food production involve the addition of functional ingredients, biologically active substances or probiotic microorganisms capable of replenishing the deficiency of necessary substances to a base product. However, in addition to their high nutritional value, healthy food products must be absolutely safe and be of high quality, which is extremely difficult to realize in the present conditions of raw material production. The review provides a rationale that the organic products manufactured using traditional technologies without the addition of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, food additives, hormonal and other drugs, can be attributed to healthy food products.

Until end of the year 2013, seed treatments were generalized. After neonicotinoid treatment restrictions, as result of EU directive 485/2013, no insecticides remain available, for maize seeds treatment, against T. dilaticollis, in Romania. As result, researches from last years were focused for finding possible alternatives to replace neonicotinoid insecticides, used for maize seed treatments, in eventuality of permanent ban of these, in 2016. In this paper, authors collective present results concerning testing of two active ingredients (cyantraniliprole and thiacloprid), for controlling of the maize leaf weevil, used high pest pressure, in laboratory conditions. The results obtained at variants treated with cyantraniliprole, thiacloprid or different combinations of these two active ingredients were compared with one standard active ingredient, clothianidin and control (untreated) variant. In this laboratory assessment, in conditions oh high pest pressure, after 8 days from pots infestation with T. dilaticollis adults, higher insect mortality was registered in case of variant treated with clothianidin active ingredients (67.50%). At the rest of the treated variants, insects mortality, after 8 days of observations, presented low values, ranged between 6.25 and 12.50%. On a scale from 1 (not attacked) to 9 (total damage), attack intensity of the T. dilaticollis at the maize untreated plants, was of 8.67. In conditions of high pest pressure, untreated plants were destroyed. The lowest attack intensity values was registered in case of variant treated with clothianidin active ingredient (I=3.92).

Hence, to overcome this problem, chitosan as a controlled release matrix was used in this work to encapsulate the fungicide for the development of enhanced fungicide nanodelivery system. In this proposed study, dual-loaded fungicides (hexaconazole and dazomet) were simultaneously encapsulated into chitosan nanoparticles as an antifungal agent on Ganoderma boninense (G. boninense).

The deposit structure reveals the extent to which dispersed active ingredient particles are bound to oil droplets in agricultural spray dispersions, before drying. The dilute spray dispersion (herein called Green Emulsion) was a suspoemulsion, which is a mixed dispersion of large (2-50 mu m) mineral oil drops and small (similar to 430 nm) poly-chlorinated Cu (II) phthalocyanine (PG7) pigments, also known as Green 7. The distribution of PG7 pigment in the dried spray drop deposit depended upon the partitioning of PG particles in the suspension before drying. Individually dispersed PG7 particles in the aqueous phase mainly ended up in the annulus (coffee ring), whereas PG7 particles adsorbed on the oil emulsion droplets ended up as a central oily deposit (the dome). After most of the water evaporated, some oil migrated beyond the dome and slowly beyond the annulus. Increasing the oil-soluble surfactant concentration inhibited PG7 binding to the oil/water interface, giving a very small dome area and a wide annulus after drying. The deposit structure is sensitive to the mixing intensity when spray concentrates are diluted in a mix-tank. Increased intensity of mixing the suspoemulsion gives smaller oil droplets, more PG7 bound to the oil/water interface and a smaller dome. The ASTM E2044 Standard Test Method for Spreading of Liquid Agricultural Spray Mixtures involves placing a drop of crop spray dispersion on PARAFILM (R) and measuring the dimensions of the resulting sessile drop. This work demonstrates that allowing the sessile drops on PARAFILM (R) to dry and analyzing the resulting deposit structure gives a direct measure of the extent to which active ingredient particles, initially dispersed in water, are transferred on or into oil drops in suspoemulsions.",2018,553,288,294,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.074

One way to improve efficacy is by enhancing foliar penetration. The plant leaf cuticle is the most significant barrier to agrochemical diffusion within the leaf. The importance of a mechanistic mathematical model has been noted previously in the literature, as each penetration experiment is dictated by its specific parameters, namely plant species, environmental conditions such as relative humidity and spray formulation including adjuvant addition. A mechanistic mathematical model has been previously developed by the authors, focusing on plant cuticle diffusion of calcium chloride through tomato fruit cuticles including pore swelling, ion binding and evaporation, along with the ability to vary the active ingredient concentration and type, relative humidity and plant species. Here we further develop this model to include adjuvant effects as well as the hygroscopic nature of deliquescent ionic solutions with evaporation on the cuticle surface. These modifications to a penetration and evaporation model provide a novel addition to the literature and allowthemodel to be applied tomany types of evaporating ionic hygroscopic solutions on many types of substrates, not just plant cuticles. We validate our theoretical model results against appropriate experimental data, discuss key sensitivities and relate theoretical predictions to physical mechanisms. The important governing mechanisms influencing surfactant enhanced penetration of ionic active through plant cuticles were found to be aqueous pore radius, pore density, cuticle thickness and initial contact angle of the applied droplet; ion binding, relative humidity and evaporation including hygroscopic water absorption parameters for point of deliquescence. The sensitivity analysis indicated surfactants increase penetration by changing the point of deliquescence of a solution, which alters the water absorption and the initial contact angle, which alters the number of pores under the droplet. The results of the validation and sensitivity analysis imply that this model accounts for many of the mechanisms governing penetration in plant cuticles.",2018,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.01888

RESULTSThe 100ppm spinosad granules resulted in similar S. frugiperda mortality compared with the chemical treatments in all three field trials, and resulted in a significantly higher maize grain yield compared with unformulated and control treatments (4141 vs. 2857 and 2407kg ha(-1), respectively) that was similar to the chemical treatment (3778kg ha(-1)).

Some co-formulants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and can contribute to ground-level ozone pollution. Effective product assessment methods are required to reduce emissions of the most reactive VOCs. Six emulsifiable concentrate pesticide products were characterized for percent VOC by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC MS). TGA estimates exceeded GC MS by 10-50% in all but one product, indicating that for some products a fraction of active ingredient is released during TGA or that VOC contribution was underestimated by GC MS. VOC profiles were examined using TGA Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) evolved gas analysis and were compared to GC MS results. The TGA FTIR method worked best for products with the simplest and most volatile formulations, but could be developed into an effective product screening tool. An ozone formation potential (OFP) for each product was calculated using the chemical composition from GC MS and published maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) values. OFP values ranged from 0.1 to 3.1 g ozone g(-1) product. A 24-h VOC emission simulation was developed for each product assuming a constant emission rate calculated from an equation relating maximum flux rate to vapor pressure. Results indicate 100% VOC loss for some products within a few hours, while other products containing less volatile components will remain in the field for several days after application. An alternate method to calculate a product OFP was investigated utilizing the fraction of the total mass of each chemical emitted at the end of the 24-h simulation. The ideal assessment approach will include: 1) unambiguous chemical composition information; 2) flexible simulation models to estimate emissions under different management practices; and 3) accurate reactivity predictions.

Exposure has generally been self-reported, so the assessment is potentially limited by recall bias and lack of information on specific chemicals. OBJECTIVES: As part of an integrated assessment of residential pesticide exposure, we identified active ingredients and described patterns of storage and use. METHODS: During a home interview of 500 residentially stable households enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during 2001-2006, trained interviewers inventoried residential pesticide products and queried participants about their storage and use. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency registration numbers, recorded from pesticide product labels, and pesticide chemical codes were matched to public databases to obtain information on active ingredients and chemical class. Poisson regression was used to identify independent predictors of pesticide storage. Analyses were restricted to 259 participating control households. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (246 of 259) of the control households stored at least one pesticide product (median, 4). Indicators of higher sociodemographic status predicted more products in storage.

Many of these species propagate by resprouting from cut stumps. The application of chemical herbicides to the cut stumps has proven to be effective in suppressing reprouting, however, herbicide use is increasingly encountering public opposition. Where herbicide use is prohibited, the lack of stump treatment quickly leads to extremely high stem densities.

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of finely-ground barley straw and bentonite in mitigating the effects of agricultural soil contamination with Successor T 550 SE. This herbicide was applied in the following doses: 0, 0.73, and 14.63 mg of the active substance per kg. The bentonite and spring barley straw were used at 10 g/kg. The action of these additives was compared to soil without the addition of straw and bentonite. The application of the experimental herbicide disturbed microbial systems, such as organotrophic bacteria, oligotrophic bacteria and their spores, actinobacteria, and fungi. A positive response to the herbicide dose of 14.63 mg a.s./kg was observed only for spores of oligotrophic bacteria. Further disturbances were observed in the agricultural soil biochemical properties, i.e., in the activity of dehydrogenases, urease, catalase, acid, and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and beta-glucosidase. A significant decrease in the activity of dehydrogenases, acid phosphatase, and arylsulfatase was observed following the application of 14.63 mg a.s./kg. The yield of maize decreased following the application of the analysed plant protection agent. Based on the soil quality index (BA), the addition of straw was more effective in restoring soil homeostasis than bentonite. Both bentonite and straw can be successfully used to improve agricultural soil biological activity. However, more effective mitigation of the negative effects of the herbicide in soil was observed in objects supplemented with barley straw. This improved the microbiological and biochemical properties of the soil.

The mean recovery of field-fortified samples was 84% (%RSD = 3.0). Field trial results generally indicated lower operator exposure levels than indicated by the most relevant operator exposure predictive model. Residues of malathion on internal dosimeters were compared to those measured on the respective outer coveralls (potential dermal exposure) to evaluate the protective factor of each one of the two coverall types used. Both coverall types provided satisfactory levels of protection and can be considered as suitable protection for the conditions of the application scenario studied.

While multiple studies have documented the toxicity, environmental persistence, and tendency to spread for glyphosate and Roundup (R), few studies have compared the toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations to the toxicity of pure glyphosate for soil invertebrates, which contact both the herbicide and the formulations. Hundreds of formulations exist; their inert ingredients are confidential; and glyphosate persists in our food, water, and soil. In this experiment, we held glyphosate type and concentration constant, varying only formulation. Using Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R), Roundup Super Concentrate (R), and pure glyphosate, we delivered 26.3 mg glyphosate in the form of isopropylamine salt per kg of soil to compost worms (Eisenia fetida). We found that worms living in soil spiked with pure glyphosate lost 14.8-25.9% of their biomass and survived a stress test for 22.2-333% less time than worms living in uncontaminated soil. Worms living in soil spiked with Roundup Ready-to-Use III (R) and Roundup Super Concentrate (R) did not lose body mass and survived the stress test as well as worms living in uncontaminated soil. No contaminant affected soil microbial or fungal biomass over the 40-day period of this experiment. We suggest that the nitrates and phosphates in the formulations offset the toxic effects of glyphosate by spurring microbial growth and speeding glyphosate degradation. We also found a 26.5-41.3% reduction in fungal biomass across all treatments over the course of this experiment, suggesting that the worms consumed fungi and spores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Fourier transform mid infrared (MIR) procedure was based on peak area measurements between 1692 and 1670 cm(-1) corrected with a baseline fixed at 1877 cm(-1). Fourier transform near infrared (NIR) determination was made by measuring the peak area between 6498 and 6332 cm(-1) corrected using a two points baseline defined between 6570 and 6212 cm(-1). Repeatability, as relative standard deviation, of 5 independent measurements at mg g(-1) concentration level was 0.3% and 0.03% for MIR and NIR, respectively, and limit of detection values of 9 and 17 mg kg(-1) in the solid sample were obtained for MIR and NIR, respectively. NIR determination provides a measurement sample frequency of 120 h(-1), higher than that found by MIR and reference chromatography methods (60 and 10 h-1, respectively). On the other hand, the NIR method reduces the solvent consumption and waste generation, to only 10.5 ml acetonitrile per sample as compared with 16.5 ml required for MIR and 66 ml used in the chromatography reference procedure. However the mean accuracy relative error obtained for the analysis of commercial samples was 0.7 and 2.9% (w/w) for MIR and NIR procedures, respectively as compared with data found by the reference procedure, being thus more accurate the MIR than the NIR methodology. So, vibrational procedures, employing a non-chlorinated solvent, such as acetonitrile, for the extraction of the active principle, can be considered serious alternatives to sensitive but expensive reagents and time consuming chromatography methods usually recommended for quality control of agrochemicals.

One outstanding threat is the unintended exposure of these pollinators to agricultural pesticides. Anthranilic diamides, such as chlorantraniliprole, are registered for use in stone and pome fruits, vegetables, turf, and grains. There are few publicly available studies that provide an analysis of chlorantraniliprole effects on the survivorship and locomotion activity of beneficial, pollinating insects such as honey bees. The data gathered in this study provide the acute toxicity, 30-day survivorship, and locomotor activity of honey bees exposed to technical-grade chlorantraniliprole and three formulated products with chlorantraniliprole as the active ingredient. RESULTS Neither the technical-grade nor the formulated products of chlorantraniliprole were acutely toxic to honey bees following 4 or 72h treatments at the tested concentrations. A 4 h treatment of technical-grade and formulated chlorantraniliprole did not significantly affect the 30-day survivorship, although significantly higher mortality was observed after 30 days for bees receiving a 72 h treatment of technical-grade chlorantraniliprole and two formulated products. The locomotion activity, or total walking distance, of bees receiving a 4 h treatment of one chlorantraniliprole formulation was significantly reduced, with these individuals recovering their normal locomotion activity at 48 h post exposure. Conversely, there was observed lethargic behavior and significantly reduced walking distances for bees provided with a 72 h treatment of technical-grade chlorantraniliprole and each formulated product. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence for the effect of long-term exposure of chlorantraniliprole on the survivorship and locomotor activity of honey bees. Bees receiving a more field-relevant short-term exposure survived and moved similarly to untreated bees, reiterating the relative safety of chlorantraniliprole exposure to adult honey bees at recommended label concentrations.",2020,76,2582,2588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5832

Among these formulations, herbicides are among the most commonly used pesticides globally. Some pesticides have been demonstrated to cause severe circulatory failure in poisoned humans. To clarify the potential risk of herbicides and their adjuvants influence on the cardiovascular system, four technical grade (TG) herbicides and their end products (EP), including paraquat, glyphosate, glufosinate, and atrazine, as well as their formulated adjuvants isopropylamine (IPA), polyoxyethylene alkylether sulfate (AES), ethyl acetate (EA), xylene, petrolium-170 (P-170), and solvesso-100 (S-100), were assessed to determine their effects on isolated rat aorta and heart. The results revealed that the vasorelaxation effects of the herbicide EPs exceeded those of TGs, and atrazine produced more significant vasorelaxation in rat aortas than the other herbicides tested. The formulated adjuvants of IPA did not affect the aorta; however, AES, EA, xylene, P-170 and S-100 caused significant vasorelaxation. Herbicide EPs-induced vasorelaxation was generally endothelium-dependent. Furthermore, the TG and EP of paraquat, and the TG of glufosinate and glyphosate were found to have no effect on the isolated heart. However, the normal twitch tensions of the isolated heart were significantly inhibited by EPs of glyphosate and glufosinate, and by TG and EP of atrazine. Although, the adjuvants of IPA appeared unaffected, however, AES, EA, xylene, P-170 and S-100 caused complete inhibition and contraction on the isolated hearts. These results indicated that the adjuvants of herbicides might enhance hypotension and contributed to cardiovascular disorders during intoxication. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

There is regulatory guidance currently under development that will specify how the combined effects of the a.s. and any relevant formulation additives shall be considered in the environmental risk assessment of biocidal products. The default option is a component-based approach (CBA) by which the toxicity of the product is predicted from the toxicity of 'relevant' components using concentration addition. Hence, unequivocal and practicable criteria are required for identifying the 'relevant' components to ensure protectiveness of the CBA, while avoiding unnecessary workload resulting from including by default components that do not significantly contribute to the product toxicity. The present study evaluated a set of different criteria for identifying 'relevant' components using confidential information on the composition of 21 wood preservative products. Theoretical approaches were complemented by experimentally testing the aquatic toxicity of seven selected products. Results: For three of the seven tested products, the toxicity was underestimated for the most sensitive endpoint (green algae) by more than factor 2 if only the a.s. were considered in the CBA. This illustrated the necessity of including at least some additives along with the a.s. Considering additives that were deemed 'relevant' by the tentatively established criteria reduced the underestimation of toxicity for two of the three products. A lack of data for one specific additive was identified as the most likely reason for the remaining toxicity underestimation of the third product. In three other products, toxicity was overestimated by more than factor 2, while prediction and observation fitted well for the seventh product. Considering all additives in the prediction increased only the degree of overestimation. Conclusions: Supported by theoretical calculations and experimental verifications, the present study developed criteria for the identification of CBA-relevant components in a biocidal product. These criteria are based on existing criteria stated in the regulation for classification, labelling and packaging of substances. The CBA was found sufficiently protective and reliable for the tested products when applying the here recommended criteria. The lack of available aquatic toxicity data for some of the identified relevant components was the main reason for underestimation of product toxicity.",2018,30,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-017-0130-0

Although it is possible to substitute desmedipham by other herbicides (especially by triflusulfuron), some troublesome weeds cannot be sufficiently controlled in specific weather conditions. Lower sensitivity to conventional herbicide mixtures is expected in dry conditions, where barriers on leaf surface are stronger. In these situations, the effect of adjuvant on efficacy and selectivity of herbicide treatment is usually significant. Oil adjuvants can increase penetration of herbicide into weed leaves, but at the same time, they reduce selectivity of herbicide in cold and rainy conditions. A new possibility of management of weeds in sugar beet is the Conviso Smart technology. Conviso Smart varieties are tolerant to ALS inhibitors (foramsulfuron + thiencarbazone) and they can be treated by Conviso One herbicide. This herbicide controls the most important weeds in sugar beet including Abutilon theophrasti, especially when split application is used. Important benefit of this technology is its high efficacy on weed beet.

An experimental study to investigate the magnitude of tebuconazole residues as a function of different tebuconazole formulated products was carried out in Italy. The fungicide was applied as wettable powder (WP) and water-dispersible granule (WG) formulations to peach, plum, apricot and nectarine orchards, on four different sites. The fruit samples gained from the field trials were quantitatively analysed by gas chromatography with a nitrogen phosphorus detector (GC/NPD) for tebuconazole residues. RESULTS: Tebuconazole residues in the fruits gained from the plot treated with the WP formulation, 14 days after application, were in the range 0.01-0.07 mg kg(-1), while corresponding residues in the plot treated with the WG formulation were in the range 0.01-0.06 mg kg(-1).

Risk assessment of pesticides, drugs or personal care products that takes into account only active ingredients without the other formulation ingredients and adjuvants commonly used in their application will miss important toxicity outcomes detrimental to non-target species including pollinators and humans. Over a billion pounds of organosilicon surfactants from all uses are produced globally per year, making this a major component of the chemical landscape to which bees and humans are exposed. These silicones, like most inerts, are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated tolerances, and their residues are largely unmonitored. Lack of their public disclosure and adequate analytical methods constrains evaluation of their risk. Organosilicon surfactants, the most super-spreading and -penetrating adjuvants available, at relevant exposure levels impair honey bee learning, are acutely toxic, and in combination with bee viruses cause synergistic mortality. Organosilicon surfactants need to be regulated as a separate class of inerts from the more common silicones. In turn, impacts of organosilicon surfactant exposures on humans need to be evaluated. Silicones in their great diversity probably represent the single most ubiquitous environmental class of global synthetic pollutants.

We present results from a long-term, multi-catchment study of urban stormwater pesticides across Australia that addresses this dichotomous identity (threat and resource), as well as dominant spatial and temporal patterns in stormwater pesticide composition. Of the 27 pesticides monitored, only 19 were detected in Australian stormwater, five of which (diuron, MCPA, 2,4-D, simazine, and triclopyr) were found in >50% of samples. Overall, stormwater pesticide concentrations were lower than reported in other countries (including the United States, Canada and Europe), and exceedances of public health and aquatic ecosystem standards were rare (<10% of samples). Spatiotemporal patterns were investigated with principal component analysis. Although stormwater pesticide composition was relatively stable across seasons and years, it varied significantly by catchment. Common pesticide.associations appear to reflect 1) user application,of common registered formulations containing characteristic suites of active ingredients, and 2) pesticide fate properties (e.g., environmental mobility and persistence).

This paper sets out to answer some of the questions that were raised at the First International Conference on Diffusible Preservatives and tries to ascertain how these specific issues are likely to effect the future use of diffusible preservatives in their currently expanding markets. Over the last decade, the use of diffusible preservatives to protect timber in service has expanded dramatically on a global scale. This has been especially the case with the group of preservatives using oxides of boron as active ingredients. This increased acceptance and utilization continues to drive the development of systems with the potential to satisfy the requirements of applications traditionally not met by diffusible preservatives. The balance between the disadvantages of preservative leaching and benefits of preservative mobility is now more widely understood. Although mobile systems have expanded in use, at the same time efforts have continued to reduce the leachability of some of these active ingredients, leading to a number of interesting developments. In terms of application, the specific use of berates to protect construction timber from termites is a major growth area. The new application of zinc berate, a controlled-release system, into wood composite products is another growth area. Opportunities with gaseous treatment ape also starting to be realized after many years of active research and development. Diffusible-based systems available today offer a highly effective and flexible option, for both stand-alone preservatives and more specialized formulations.

We evaluated representative insecticides toward the goal of developing a novel, ingestible liquid bait for hematophagous arthropods. RESULTS: LC50 values were estimated for adult males and first instar nymphs of an insecticide-susceptible strain for abamectin, clothianidin, fipronil and indoxacarb, after ingestion from an artificial feeder. LD50 values were calculated based on the ingested blood volume. Ingested abamectin, clothianidin and fipronil caused rapid mortality in both life stages. Fipronil was similar to 43-fold more effective by ingestion than by topical application. Indoxacarb and its bioactive metabolite decarbomethoxylated JW062 (DCJW) were ineffective at causing bed bug mortality even at concentrations as high as 1000 ng mL(-1) blood. CONCLUSIONS: Fipronil, clothianidin and abamectin have potential for being incorporated into a liquid bait for bed bug control; indoxacarb and DCJW were not effective. Bed bugs are a good candidate for an ingestible liquid bait because systemic formulations generally require less active ingredient than residual sprays, they remain contained and more effectively target hematophagous arthropods.

Four field evaluations were conducted at the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (Queensland) research station facilities at Kingaroy (KRS) and Emerald (ERS) in 2016 and 2017. Two 'insecticide evaluations' included treatment options with different rates of active ingredients and adjuvants, aimed at validating efficacy results obtained in previous glasshouse evaluations. The other two 'IPM evaluations' were designed to test the compatibility of selected insecticidal active ingredients with naturally occurring beneficial arthropods through differential exclusion by means of large field cages configured to be either partially open or fully closed to regulate access. Spirotetramat gave consistent and commercially acceptable (>= 80%) control of large and small mealybugs at the highest rate of 96 g in these insecticide evaluations. The addition of crop oil to spirotetramat as a tank mix partner significantly enhanced efficacy, as documented previously in glasshouse evaluations. Sulfoxaflor provided equivalent control of large and small mealybugs but only at the ERS site. The overall control efficacy of buprofezin was equivalent to spirotetramat and sulfoxaflor at the ERS site but inferior to both at the KRS site. In the IPM evaluations, the abundance of predatory arthropods and their potential contribution to overall mortality was generally low. Parasitism contributed significantly to overall mortality among treatments over time and was independent of cage status (closed or open). Large mealybugs were equitably distributed between the upper (terminal) and lower sections of the cotton plant canopy in both ERS evaluations whereas in the KRS evaluations the distribution was biased towards the lower section. The importance of pest distribution within the crop canopy in the context of insecticide efficacy is discussed. The results of this study confirm the importance of spirotetramat, sulfoxaflor and buprofezin as key insecticidal platforms that will give growers and crop managers the flexibility and confidence to implement sustainable, multi-pest IPM strategies in Australian cotton.",2022,61,113,123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aen.12578

Droplet size, in turn, has an influence in the deposited spray quality, in addition to the drift and losses of spray to off-target places. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of adding adjuvants to two types of water from different sources on the droplet size characteristics. Two types of adjuvants were employed in the tests: the active substance content of the first adjuvant was a 50% aqueous solution of sodium salt of alkylbenzenesulfonic acid-10% (HY), whereas the second was from rapeseed oil (natural origin)-85% (OL). Both adjuvants were tested in two concentrations: the first was with the concentration recommended by the manufacturer (100%), whereas the second concentration was 50% of the recommended dose. Two types of water from different sources were used in the tests: the first was from a village in the eastern part of Poland (WS), whereas the second was tap water from the city of Lublin, Poland (WUP). D-v0.1, D-v0.5, or volume median diameter (VMD), D-v0.9, Sauter mean diameter (SMD), relative span (RS), and the droplet size distribution were measured and calculated as characteristics of the droplet size. Results showed that the source of water affected the influence of adding adjuvant to the spray solution. Water from the WS source with adjuvant resulted in a numerical decrease in the D-v0.5 values in the percentage of droplet size range below 150 mu m, whereas water from the WUP source resulted in an increase in these values (except when adding the HY adjuvant at 50% concentration). Adjuvant concentration significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the features of D-v0.9, SMD, and RS.

Stimuli-responsive controlled-release agrochemicals enhance the bioavailability of active ingredients and reduce the frequency of use and environmental pollution. Herein, 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid was used as a functional bridge to covalently link the degradable natural polymer zein and chitosan oligosaccharides (CS) to prepare a water-dispersed environmentally friendly pesticide carrier. Subsequently, via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions photo-decomposable avermectin (AVM) was encapsulated forming a stimuli-responsive intelligent nanopesticide delivery system (AVM@CS-SS-Zein) was developed by encapsulating in the carrier. AVM was released slowly from AVM@CS-SS-Zein particles in a neutral condition and was released rapidly under stimulation of glutathione and alkalinity in simulated insects. The photostability of AVM@CS-SS-Zein was improved by 6-fold compared with that of AVM and the nanoparticles had good adherence to the leaves, slowly releasing AVM and avoiding the light decomposition of active ingredients. When the pests ingest the leaves containing AVM@CS-SS-Zein, the rapid disintegration of the nanoparticles in vivo leads to a good insecticidal effect and the control rate of AVM@CS-SS-Zein on Plutella xylostella was higher than that of AVM. After 120 h of UV irradiation, the pest mortality rate of AVM@CS-SS-Zein was 46.7% while that of AVM and AVM emulsifiable concentrate was only 13.3% and 20.0%, respectively. Therefore, this pH/redox dual stimuli-responsive nanopesticide formulation achieves target control of pests and provides an efficient nanoplatform for green agriculture.",2022,435,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.134861

This risk can be minimized through the application of the pesticide at a set rate using controlled release formulations (CRFs). In this research, CRFs of isoproturon, imidacloprid and cyromazine have been evaluated in a calcareous soil. The effects of two natural polymers (alginate and lignin) and two modifying sorbents (bentonite and activated carbon) on pesticide release kinetics from CRFs have been investigated, as well as mobility of pesticides using soil columns. The rate of pesticide release in soil from CRFs diminished in all cases in relation to technical products. From the analysis of the time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into soil (T-50soil) it can be deduced that the release rate of pesticides can be controlled by using activated carbon in the alginate-based CRFs and mixing the pesticide with kraft lignin. Mobility experiments showed that the use of CRFs clearly reduces the presence of isoproturon and imidacloprid in the leachate compared to technical products, and to a lesser extent for cyromacine due to its high water solubility.

These treatments are applied topically within fish nets or well boats. Following a short treatment period, the pesticides are directly discharged to sea, exposing non-target organisms such as P. borealis to diluted concentrations of these chemicals. Locomotor activity was measured continuously in individual shrimp over several days within which they were exposed to treatments of diluted AlphaMax (R) or Salmosan (R). Dilutions were based on modelling and dispersion studies from the literature and were considered environmentally realistic for greater than 1 km from point of discharge. 24 h continuous flow treatments were delivered within a 3.5-day monitoring period to observe the timeline of events following the release of treatment water, addressing questions of temporal responses in locomotor activity, recognising key time points of significant events and assessing the survival capacity of the shrimp. Exposure of shrimp to 1 ng l(-1) deltamethrin triggered an immediate increase in swimming activity which reduced in intensity over the following 22 h leaving all shrimp either moribund or dead. A further exposure trial exposing shrimp to 0.2 ng l(-1) deltamethrin (nominal) showed an increase in activity at the start of exposure that continued throughout the 24 h delivery, returning to previous levels by the end of the 3.5-day monitoring period. All these shrimps survived for at least four weeks after exposure, putting the threshold concentration of deltamethrin leading to immobility or death in adult P. borealis within this study at greater than 0.2 ng l(-1) (nominal) and less than 1 ng l(-1) (measured). Exposure of P. borealis to azamethiphos at 30 ng l(-1) induced several periods of significantly increased activity within the first 10 h of exposure and an extended period of reduced activity during post exposure, though no morbidity was observed with this treatment. No significant increase in activity or morbidity was observed in shrimp during a water vehicle control assessment. Shrimps exposed to a combination of 30 ng l(-1) azamethiphos and 1 ng l(-1) deltamethrin broadly followed the response pattern shown by shrimp exposed to 1 ng l(-1) deltamethrin alone.

However, like all tools, rodenticides have advantages and disadvantages. Several considerations are shaping the future of rodenticide use, including manufacturing and registration costs, concern about toxicity levels and nontarget animal hazards, potential hazards to children, reduced effectiveness of some formulations, and humaneness to the targeted rodents. Many of these disadvantages apply to anticoagulant rodenticides, and their use is being more restricted in numerous settings. This paper discusses rodenticide use but also alternative control methods such as traps, exclusion, habitat management, repellents, and fertility control. While there have been relatively few new developments in rodenticides and other rodent control methods in the last several decades, new formulations and active ingredients are being investigated so that these concerns can be addressed.

As shown in the past, tank-mix adjuvants might reduce the rain-induced removal of active ingredients. The aims of this study were a) to characterize the impact of defined rain amount on the removal of Cu-oxychloride (Cu-Ox) and Cu-hydroxide (Cu-Hyd) from apple seedling leaves, b) to examine the influence of ethoxylated seed oil adjuvants on deposit properties at the micro scale and their possible influence in reducing the fungicide erosion from the leaves, and finally c) to evaluate the influence of previous adjuvant application on the rainfastness of copper ions. Losses of Cu-Hyd and Cu-Ox from seedling leaves exposed to 5 mm heavy rain reached almost 80% of the original Cu load. Wash-off extent of Cu-Ox could be reduced by using the rapeseed oil ethoxylate RSO 5 (47%), the linseed oil ethoxylate LSO 10 (47%), or the soybean oil ethoxylate SBO 10 (40%). However, in case of Cu-Hyd, none of the adjuvants was able to increase the tenacity of the copper on the leaves. Rainfall removed the bulky deposits and induced changes in the typical shape of the crystals. Furthermore, a reorganization of the spatial distribution of the remaining active ingredient (a.i.) was induced, which was very often embedded in a thin layer of adjuvants. In general, the adjuvants had a significant impact on droplet spread, whereas the area effectively covered with the a.i. was affected to a lesser extent. For both Cu-Hyd and Cu-Ox rewetting of the original deposit under controlled conditions resulted in an increased spread area but reduced the area effectively covered with Cu. Our results showed no clear relationship between the area covered by Cu ions and their adhesion to the surface, i.e. rainfastness. Finally, our studies indicated that previous spray treatments might influence the rain-induced removal of copper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Ivermectin is a widely-used drug for treating parasites of humans and animals that is also insecticidal, killing mosquitoes that feed on treated subjects. Mass administration of ivermectin to livestock could be particularly useful for tackling residual malaria transmission by zoophagic vectors that evade human-centred approaches. Ivermectin comes from a different chemical class to active ingredients currently used to treat bednets or spray houses, so it also has potential for mitigating against emergence of insecticide resistance. However, the duration of insecticidal activity obtained with ivermectin is critical to its effectiveness and affordability. Results: A slow-release formulation for ivermectin was implanted into cattle, causing 40 weeks of increased mortality among Anopheles arabiensis that fed on them. For this zoophagic vector of residual malaria transmission across much of Africa, the proportion surviving three days after feeding (typical mean duration of a gonotrophic cycle in field populations) was approximately halved for 25 weeks. Conclusions: This implantable ivermectin formulation delivers stable and sustained insecticidal activity for approximately 6 months. Residual malaria transmission by zoophagic vectors could be suppressed by targeting livestock with this long-lasting formulation, which would be impractical or unacceptable for mass treatment of human populations.",2018,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2872-y

The paper also outlines the specific characteristics of agronomical and herbicidal management of field crops including sugar beet stands against the weed. Such management can improve the efficiency of herbicidal treatments and in case of sugar beet it is based on repeated or divided herbicides applications. Efficiency of herbicides authorized for sugar beet weed management partially covers jimsonweed but its efficacy against this weed is usually insufficient - which is partially due to the commonly used system of divided doses. The divided and thus lowered doses of herbicides require correct timing of applications aimed at very early growth stages of jimsonweed. Such doses also require a combination of herbicidal and mechanical treatments. The herbicide active substances commonly used for sugar beet weed control such as phenmedipham, chloridazon, metamitron as well as their combinations synergetically damage jimsonweed up to the two-leaf stage. During the two to four leaf stage, jimsonweed can be controlled by mixtures of chloridazon and quinmerac in combination with phenmedipham and desmedipham; in this case there is also some soil activity and thus longer efficacy.

Application practices of 2,4-D commercial herbicides typically coincide with yearly freshwater fish spawning periods. This practice exposes fish to xenobiotics at their vulnerable larval stages. The full impacts of 2,4-D on larval fish remains poorly understood, and hence, whether it may alter larval survival, larval behavior, fish populations, and ecosystem dynamics. In the present study, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to the active ingredient 2,4-D (pure 2,4-D) or a 2,4-D containing commercial herbicide DMA4 (R) IVM (DMA4) and evaluated morphology, survival, behavior, and nervous system function. At 2,4-D concentrations producing no overt morphological defects during embryonic or early larval stages, we observed reduced survival throughout a 21-day larval assay (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D). Notably, prey capture, a behavior essential to survival, was reduced in 2,4-D-exposed larval zebrafish (4-8 ppm DMA4 and 0.75-4 ppm pure 2,4-D) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) (4-20 ppm DMA4). In zebrafish, 8 ppm DMA4 exposure reduced prey capture when exposure was restricted to the period of visual system development. Consistent with these results, larval zebrafish exposed to 8 ppm DMA4 showed reduced neural activity within the optic tectum following prey exposure. Together, our results suggest that 2,4-D alters the development and function of neural circuits underlying vision of larval fish, and thereby reduces visually guided behaviors required for survival.",2019,209,1,12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.015

The susceptibility of the muscoid fly pupal parasitoid Muscidifurax raptor to an azadirachtin-based insecticide was determined in laboratory bioassays. Parasitoid adults directly fed a diet containing the insecticide showed a slight reduction in their lifiespan (25.1% and 15.7%, males and females, respectively) and reproduction rate (27.5%) at the highest concentration tested (20 mu g [AZ]/ nil). No significant effects were noticed at lower concentration. Interestingly, M. raptor males LC50 = 43.0 mu g [AZ]/ml) were more susceptible than females (LC50 = 94.7 mu g [AZ]/ml). Immature parasitoids were able to develop and emerge successfully from house flies pre-treated at concentration levels that almost completely inhibited fly emergence (30 mu g [AZ]/g). At this concentration level, longevity of emerging parasitoids was significantly reduced (20.6% and 17.6%, male and female, respectively), as was F1 progeny rate (35.9%), in comparison to the control. Overall, the effects of azadirachtin on M. raptor are minimal compared to those in major livestock pests, thus the use of azadirachtin-based formulations can be considered compatible with integrated livestock pest management programs.

The past decades have witnessed tremendous advances in improving fungal pesticides through selection of heat-tolerant strains from natural isolates, improvements and innovations in terms of solid-state fermentation technologies for the production of more heat-tolerant conidia, and the use of genetic engineering of candidate strains for enhancing heat tolerance. More recently, with the entry into a post-genomic era, a large number of signaling and effector genes have been characterized as important sustainers of heat tolerance in both Beauveria and Metarhizium, which represent the main species used as fungal pesticides worldwide. This review focuses on recent advances and provides an overview into the broad molecular basis of fungal heat tolerance and its multiple regulatory pathways. Emphases are placed on approaches for screening of heat-tolerant strains, methods for optimizing conidial quality linked to virulence and heat tolerance particularly involving cell wall architecture and optimized trehalose/mannitol contents, and how molecular determinants can be exploited for genetic improvement of heat tolerance and pest-control potential.

Early studies (1973-1981) elucidated the special properties of these compounds, notably their extreme spreading and, by virtue of the exceptionally low surface tensions of their aqueous solutions, the ability to induce infiltration of spray formulations into foliage via stomata. Subsequent research at the New Zealand Forest Research Institute explored these and other properties in-depth, and demonstrated that they enabled the herbicide glyphosate to be used as a cost-effective alternative to 2,4,5-T for the control of forest scrubweeds. As a result, in 1985, 'Silwet' L-77 was the first organosilicone adjuvant to be commercialised, and various other products have subsequently been introduced. The chemistry and synthesis of these organosilicones have been detailed. A mechanistic approach has been adopted to consider the effects of the distinctive properties of organosilicones in each of the processes involved in spray application of agrochemicals. Commencing with spray formulation, the topics of foaming, hydrolytic stability and interactions with co-formulants are discussed. Progressing to spray application, consideration is given to the effects of organosilicones on atomisation and impaction (wetting, adhesion/reflection, spreading, retention/run-off), and the resultant influences on the activity of protectant agrochemicals. An assessment of the use of organosilicones with systemic agrochemicals includes examination of effects on foliar uptake, via both cuticular and stomatal pathways, and the rainfastness which the latter provides. Also considered is the physiological behaviour of organosilicones, specifically phytotoxicity and effects on translocation of active ingredients. The current and potential future use of organosilicones with herbicides, foliar nutrients, growth regulators, insecticides and fungicides is discussed, as is the specificity of their effects. Additionally, the potential application of organosilicone chemistry to adjuvant classes other than the spreader/penetrant type investigated to date is considered. Finally, the issues of registration, handling hazards, both toxicological and chemical, and environmental impact are discussed.

Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and homeopathy are practiced in India as non-allopathic systems. These systems comprise a wide range of therapeutic approaches that include diet, herbs, metals, minerals, precious stones and their combinations as well as nondrug therapies. Ayurveda is the oldest system of medicine in the world and by far the most commonly practiced form of non-allopathic medicine in India, particularly in rural India, where 70% of the population lives. The difference between modern medicine and these systems stems from the fact that the knowledge base of many of the above systems, unlike Western medicine, is based on years of experience, observations, empiricism and intuition and has been handed down generations both through word of mouth and treatises. The focus on non-allopathic systems of medicine in India can be attributed to various causes including a need to revive a rich tradition, the dependency of 80% of the country's population on these drugs, their easy availability, increasing worldwide use of these medicines, the lack of focused concerted scientific research and the abuse of these systems by quacks. Elsewhere, the increasing use of herbal products worldwide and the growth of the herbal product industry has led to increasing concern regarding their safety. The challenges in these non-allopathic systems relate to the patient, physician, regulatory authorities, the abuse/misuse of these medicines, quality and purity issues. Safety monitoring is mandated by a changing ecological environment, the use of insecticides, new manufacturing techniques, an as yet unregulated pharmaceutical industry, the availability of combinations of herbs over the counter and not mentioned in ancient Ayurvedic texts, and the need to look at the active principles of these medicines as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The Indian traditional medicine industry has come a long way from the times when it was considered unnecessary to test these formulations prior to use, to the introduction of Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines for the industry. However, we still have a long way to go. The conflict between the traditional practitioners and the purists demanding evidence of safety and efficacy needs to be addressed.

A non-polar pesticide (lambda-cyhalothrin) was used as a model.

For foliar-applied herbicide, generally less than 0.1% of the active ingredient reaching the target site could reduce pesticide performance. Recently, a carrier of nanoemulsion consisting of oil, surfactant and water, with a particle size of less than 200 nm, has been shown to enhance drug permeability for skin penetration in pharmaceutical delivery systems. In the present work, the aim was to formulate a water-soluble herbicide, glyphosate isopropylamine (IPA), using a green nanoemulsion system for a biological activity study against the weeds creeping foxglove, slender button weed and buffalo grass. RESULTS: The nanoemulsion formulations displayed a significantly lower spray deposition on creeping foxglove (2.93.5 ng cm-2), slender button weed (2.62.9 ng cm-2) and buffalo grass (1.82.4 ng cm-2) than Roundup (R) (3.75.1 ng cm-2). The visible injury rates of weeds treated with the nanoemulsion formulations were statistically equivalent to those relating to Roundup (R) at 14 days after treatment, with a control range of 86.6796.67%. CONCLUSION: It was hypothesised that the significant difference in spray deposition with equal injury rates can be attributed to enhanced bioactivity of the nanoemulsion formulations.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations. In summary, combining an active ingredient with a custom synergist appears to be a very promising approach for the development of effective new insecticide products.",2016,64,5148,5155,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01512

However, GBH encompass a variety of glyphosate salts as active ingredient and different adjuvants, which differ between products. These herbicides reach water bodies and produce diverse impacts over aquatic communities. Yet, the risk assessment assays required for the approval focus mostly on active ingredients. Herein, we compared the effect of five different GBH as well as of monoisopropylamine salt of glyphosate (GIPA) on aquatic microbial communities from natural shallow lakes that were mixed and allowed to evolve in an outdoor pond. We performed an 8-day long assay under indoor control conditions to evaluate the effects of exposure on the structure of nano-plus microphytoplankton (net phytoplankton, with sizes between 2 and 20 mu m and >20 mu m, respectively) and picoplankton (size ranging between 0.2 and 2 mu m) communities through microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Significantly different effects were evident on the structure of microbial communities dependent on the GBH, even with herbicides sharing similar active ingredients. Each GBH evoked increases of different magnitude in bacterioplankton abundance. Furthermore, GIPA and a formulation decreased the abundance of a phycocyanin-rich (PC-rich) picocyanobacteria (Pcy) cytometric population and GIPA further altered Pcy composition. Also, two GBH increased net phytoplankton total abundance and, unlike the tested GBH, no apparent effect of GIPA was detected on this community structure. These results demonstrate that GBH effects on aquatic microbial communities should not be summarized as glyphosate effects considering that the formulations have effects beyond those exerted by the active ingredients alone.

It contains glyphosate as the 'active ingredient', together with formulants. There are various versions of Roundup, with somewhat different effects depending on the formulants. Most genetically-modified crops are designed to tolerate Roundup, thus allowing spraying against weeds during the growing season of the crop without destroying it. Having been so heavily used, this herbicide is now found in the soil, water, air, and even in humans worldwide. Roundup may also remain as a residue on edible crops. Many studies have found harm to the environment and to health, making it imperative to regulate the use of Roundup and to ensure that its various formulations pose no danger when used in the long-term. Unfortunately, regulators may only assess the 'active ingredient', glyphosate, and ignore the toxicity of the formulants, which can be far more toxic than the active ingredient. This omission is in violation of a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union. There are close ties between the regulators and the industry they are supposed to regulate. Objectionable practices include 'revolving doors' between the regulators and the industry, heavy reliance on unpublished papers produced by the industry while dismissing papers published by independent scientists, and strong covert influence on the regulatory process by industry.

Panomycocin is a potent antimycotic protein secreted by the yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus NCYC 434. This study involved the preparation of panomycocin-loaded stratum corneum lipid liposomes (SCLLs), characterization of the SCLLs, and determination of antimycotic efficacy of the formulation against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata clinical vaginal isolates in a human vaginal epithelium tissue model. The encapsulation and loading efficiencies of SCLLs were 73% and 76.8%, respectively. In transmission electron microscopy images, the SCLLs appeared in the submicron size range. Dynamic light scattering analyses showed that the SCLLs had uniform size distribution. Zeta potential measurements revealed stable and positively charged SCLLs. In Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, no irreversible interactions between the encapsulated panomycocin and the SCLLs were detected. The SCLLs retained > 98% of encapsulated panomycocin in aqueous solution up to 12 hours. The formulation was fungicidal at the same minimum fungicidal concentration values for non-formulated pure panomycocin when tested on an in vitro model of vaginal candidiasis. This is the first study in which SCLLs and a protein as an active ingredient have been utilized together in a formulation.

Resistance ratios (RR) of >10 to chlorpyrifos (LD50) were directly related to a significant decrease in activity in Ebeling choice-box tests. Using the LT method, the three field-collected strains were shown to possess zero to moderate resistance at the RR50 level (0.9-5.3) to organophosphates, moderate to high resistance to (1.4->21.0) to carbamates, moderate to high resistance (4.3-20) to cypermethrin, and high resistance (>17->35) to synergized pyrethrins.

Cypermethrin deposits used in choice tests killed cockroaches exhibiting RR50s as high as 20 in the lethal time test, perhaps because resistance mechanisms could not detoxify the exceptional activity of the active ingredient formulated as a wettable powder. Because they were repellent, residual deposits of pyrethrins resulted in poor efficacy in choice tests with either susceptible or field-collected strains.

Some of the main considerations with which pesticide formulators and users contend include physical durability, flowability, ballistics properties, chemical compatibility, favorable econometrics, and pesticidal efficacy. An evaluation of the commercially available mined and recycled materials, as well as an analysis of the requirements for efficacious granules, has led the researchers to define a combination of criteria that was previously unrealized in any of the selections of the then commercially available granular pesticide carriers. The research objective that emerged, developing a more optimal pesticide granule, was defined by these criteria. Many dozens of prototype formulations were produced in a laboratory granulation system and were evaluated by various physical test methods until the original design criteria were met. Subsequently, a period of field efficacy trials took place in which suitability for particular active ingredients, target pests, and cultural conditions was determined. An engineered composite granule and production process was developed during the course of this research. The resulting granules have a unique combination of characteristics: robust enough to withstand the physical stresses of bulk handling, formulating and field application, good flowability and compositional characteristics, plus a unique degree of dispersion upon the application of a small amount of moisture over the treated area after the granules have been applied. This post-application water dispersion mechanism appears to allow enhanced pesticidal efficacy for soil treatment and systemic active ingredients, and has demonstrated numerous aesthetic and hazard reduction attributes of interest.

Other chemicals in GBHs are presumed as inert by regulatory authorities and are largely ignored in pesticide safety evaluations. We identified the surfactants in a cross-section of GBH formulations and compared their acute toxic effects. The first generation of polyethoxylated amine (POEA) surfactants (POE-tallowamine) in Roundup are markedly more toxic than glyphosate and heightened concerns of risks to human health, especially among heavily-exposed applicators. Beginning in the mid-1990s, first-generation POEM were progressively replaced by other POEA surfactants, ethoxylated etheramines, which exhibited lower non-target toxic effects. Lingering concern over surfactant toxicity was mitigated at least in part within the European Union by the introduction of propoxylated quaternary ammonium surfactants. This class of POEA surfactants are 100 times less toxic to aquatic ecosystems and human cells than previous GBH-POEA surfactants. As GBH composition is legally classified as confidential commercial information, confusion concerning the identity and concentrations of co-formulants is common and descriptions of test substances in published studies are often erroneous or incomplete. In order to resolve this confusion, laws requiring disclosure of the chemical composition of pesticide products could be enacted.

The nature of the plant cuticle is reviewed with particular regard to its action as a potential barrier to the penetration of pesticide molecules; the role of the cuticular waxes is highlighted. The physicochemical properties of the cuticle influence the behaviour of spray droplets and, in turn, may affect the rate and efficiency of cuticle penetration. The permeation of active ingredients is influenced by their solubility characteristics as indicated by octanol/water (log K-ow) and cuticle/water (K-ow) partition coefficients. Penetration of hydrophilic compounds (low log K-ow) may be enhanced by hydration of the cuticle, while transcuticular transport of non-polar solutes (high log K-ow) is increased by factors which reduce wax viscosity. The use of in-vitro models involving isolated cuticle membranes, isolated cuticle waxes, or isolated leaves has helped to focus on the activities of the cuticle in the absence of other physiological factors. Using these systems, the role of the waxes as a transport-limiting barrier has been identified and the factors influencing sorption, permeance and desorption examined. The action of surfactants, in vitro and in vivo, has been briefly addressed in regard to their role in facilitating cuticle penetration; other steps involving surfactant/solute/cuticle are complex, and synergy appears to depend on a number of factors including test species, concentration of active ingredient, surfactant type and concentration. Adjuvants may greatly influence the surface properties of the droplet, predispose the cuticle to solute transport, and enhance pesticide activity.

The fungicide Pristine (R) and its active ingredients (25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) have been reported to have low acute toxicity to caged honey bee workers, but many sublethal effects at field-relevant doses have been reported and Pristine (R) was recently found to increase worker pollen consumption, reduce worker longevity and colony populations at field relevant concentrations (Fisher et al. 2021). To directly compare these whole-colony field results to more standard laboratory toxicology tests, the effects of Pristine (R), at a range of field-relevant concentrations, were assessed on the survival and pollen consumption of honey bee workers 0-14 days of age. Also, to separate the effects of the inert and two active ingredients, bees were fed pollen containing boscalid, pyraclostrobin, or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid, at concentrations matching those in the Pristine (R) treatments. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced pollen consumption across the duration of the experiment, and dose dependently reduced pollen consumption on days 12-14. Pristine (R) and boscalid significantly reduced pollen feeding rate on days 12-14. Boscalid reduced survival in a dose-dependent manner. Consumption of Pristine (R) or pyraclostrobin plus boscalid did not affect survival, providing evidence against strong negative effects of the inert ingredients in Pristine (R) and against negative synergistic effects of boscalid and pyraclostrobin.

Previously, we demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate during gestation induces deficits on behavioral and cognitive function in rats. The aim of the present work was to examine whether cognitive dysfunction induced by Glyphosate was connected to changes on synapse formation and maturation. To understand how glyphosate affects synaptic assembly, we performed in vitro assays on cultured hippocampal neurons that were exposed to the herbicide (0.5 or 1 mg/mL) for 5 or 10 days. Biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches revealed that Glyphosate treated neurons showed a decrease on dendritic complexity and synaptic spine formation and maturation. Moreover, results indicated that Glyphosate decreased synapse formation in hippocampal neurons. To evaluate these effects in vivo, pup rats were treated with 35 or 70 mg/kg of Glyphosate from PND 7 to PND 27, every 48 h. Results indicated that Glyphosate postnatal exposure induced cognitive impairments, since recognition and spatial memory were altered. To go further, we evaluated synaptic protein expression and synaptic organization in hippocampus. Images revealed that Glyphosate treatment downregulates synapsin-1, PSD-95, and CaMKII expression, and also decreased PSD-95 clustering in hippocampus.

Regardless of the cropping system, weeds remain to be among the major factors that limit yields. The use of herbicides to manage weeds in these systems has been increasing through the years. The use of 2,4-D started in the late 1940s and remains as a major herbicide to control rice weeds. The 1980s saw the introduction of multiple active ingredients of herbicides for rice, corn and perennial crops, mostly selective herbicides with highly specific target sites and MOA. Glyphosate, commonly used in perennial crop-based systems, is now used at pre-planting in rice and corn and post-emergence in genetically modified corn. The intensive and continuous use of herbicides resulted in resistance development in weeds. To date, 37 unique cases of herbicide resistance are reported involving 17 weed species and 30 active ingredients. The rise in herbicide resistance and environmental pollution is largely due to insufficient farmer education on proper use of herbicides and integrated weed management, poor product stewardship, and lax implementation of pesticide policies and regulations.

The aim of this review is to discuss promising solutions that nanotechnology may provide in agricultural activities, with a specific focus on critical aspects, challenging issues, and research needs for occupational risk assessment and management in this emerging field. Eco-toxicological aspects were not the focus of the review. Nano-fertilizers, (nano-sized nutrients, nano-coated fertilizers, or engineered metal-oxide or carbon-based nanomaterials per se), and nano-pesticides, (nano-formulations of traditional active ingredients or inorganic nanomaterials), may provide a targeted/controlled release of agrochemicals, aimed to obtain their fullest biological efficacy without over dosage. Nano-sensors and nano-remediation methods may detect and remove environmental contaminants. However, limited knowledge concerning nanomaterial biosafety, adverse effects, fate, and acquired biological reactivity once dispersed into the environment, requires further scientific efforts to assess possible nano-agricultural risks. In this perspective, toxicological research should be aimed to define nanomaterial hazards and levels of exposure along the life-cycle of nano-enabled products, and to assess those physico-chemical features affecting nanomaterial toxicity, possible interactions with agro-system co-formulants, and stressors.

Indiscriminate and negligent use of GBHs has promoted the emergence of glyphosate resistant weeds, and consequently the rise in the use of these herbicides. Glyphosate, the active ingredient of all GBHs, is combined with other chemicals known as co-formulants that enhance the herbicide action. Nowadays, the safety of glyphosate and its formulations remain to be a controversial issue, as evidence is not conclusive whether the adverse effects are caused by GBH or glyphosate, and little is known about the contribution of co-formulants to the toxicity of herbicides. Currently, alarmingly increased levels of glyphosate have been detected in different environmental matrixes and in foodstuff, becoming an issue of social concern. Some in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that glyphosate and its formulations exhibit estrogen-like properties, and growing evidence has indicated they may disrupt normal endocrine function, with adverse consequences for reproductive health. Moreover, multigenerational effects have been reported and epigenetic mechanisms have been proved to be involved in the alterations induced by the herbicide. In this review, we provide an overview of: i) the routes and levels of human exposure to GBHs, ii) the potential estrogenic effects of glyphosate and GBHs in cell culture and animal models, iii) their long-term effects on female fertility and mechanisms of action, and iv) the consequences on health of successive generations.",2021,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.672532

In the experiments, the ability of three popular lily cultivars (Lilium Oriental hybrids 'Sorbonne', Lilium LA (Longiflorum hybrids x Asiatic hybrids) hybrids 'Ceb Dazzle', and Lilium Longiflorum hybrids (L. formosanum x L. longiflorum) 'L. formolongo') to induce O. aegyptiaca Persoon. seed germination was assessed. Parts of the three lily cultivars, including the rhizosphere soil and underground and above-ground organs, all induced suicidal germination of parasitic O. aegyptiaca Persoon. seed at four growth stages. Specifically, Sorbonne and Ceb Dazzle behaved with similar allelopathy, and the bulb, scale leaf and aerial stem exhibited stronger allelopathic effects on O. aegyptiaca Pers. germination compared to other organs. Aqueous L. formolongo leaf extracts may contain more stable, effective stimulants given that they induced the highest germination rate at 76.7% even though the extracts were serially diluted. We speculate that these organs may be advantageous in further isolating and purifying economical active substances that can be substitutes for GR24.

This raises questions concerning potential combination effects, especially because these substances are tested for regulatory purposes on an individual basis. With approximately 500 active substances approved as pesticides, there are too many possible combinations to be tested in standard animal experiments generally requested for regulatory purposes. Therefore, the development of in vitro tools and alternative testing strategies for the assessment of mixture effects is extremely important. As a first step in the development of such in vitro tools, we used (tri)azoles as model substances in a set of different cell lines derived from the primary target organ of these substances, the liver (human: HepaRG, rat: H4IIE). Concentrations were reconciled with measured tissue concentrations obtained from in vivo experiments to ensure comparable effect levels. The effects of the substances were subsequently analyzed by transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques and compared to data from corresponding in vivo studies. The results show that similar toxicity pathways are affected by substances and combinations, thus indicating a similar mode of action and additive effects.

The goal of this study was to determine the toxicity and mechanism of action of phenylpropanoids (trans-anethole and estragole) isolated from the methanol extract and hydrodistillate of Illicium verum fruit against third-instar larvae and eggs of Bradysia procera. RESULTSThe filter-paper mortality bioassay revealed that estragole [median lethal concentration (LC50) = 4.68 g/cm(2)] has a significant fumigant effect, followed by trans-anethole (LC50 = 43.92 g/cm(2)). However, estragole had the lowest toxic effect when compared to commercially available insecticides. After 7 days, estragole and trans-anethole at 75 g/cm(2) inhibited egg hatchability up to 97% and 93%, respectively. At 0.09 g/cm(2), insecticides had an inhibitory effect on egg-hatching ability ranging from 88% to 94%. Furthermore, in both closed and open containers, these active constituents were able to consistently induce vapor-phased toxicity. Both estragole and trans-anethole have the ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is involved in neurotransmitter function. However, the active constituent estragole from I. verum fruit acted as a potent AChE inhibitor and had a slightly lower effect on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) than octopamine alone. CONCLUSIONThis finding suggests that estragole may influence Bradysia procera neurotransmitter function via both the AChE and octopaminergic receptors. More research is needed to demonstrate the potential applications of I. verum fruit-derived products as potential larvicides and ovicides for Bradysia procera population control.

RESULTS Coating seeds of common crop plants with a p-coumaric acid (p-CA)-based preparation resulted in a significant reduction in the growth of most of the tested pathogens. When applied to soil, both the p-CA-based formulation and Porter 250 EC had a similar overall effect on soil fungal communities and significantly altered the structure of fungal communities at all of the times examined. Shifts in the fungal community composition concerned less than 2% of the total number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The strongest impact of the formulations on soil microbiota was recorded at the fourth week of treatment. Two ASVs assigned to Botrytis and Chromelosporium, known as plant pathogens, and an unidentified ASV from Diversisporales encompassing the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), were significantly depleted in soil samples treated with p-CA in comparison with Porter 250 EC.

Currently no effective options are available for control of houseflies outdoors, because many populations exhibit at least some resistance to all available synthetic pesticides. (Z)-9-tricosene is the only commercially available pheromone for use in lure-and-kill approaches to housefly control, and it is widely used in indoor livestock units in combination with sugar/insecticide bait. Here we examine the potential of this approach for use outdoors, on a landfill site. We investigate the efficacy of toxic targets painted with a sugar/insecticide/(Z)-9-tricosene mix. The effects of target size and pheromone concentration were examined in two replicate trials, conducted in June and September 2003. As expected, catch consisted largely of males, was consistently higher on larger traps, and generally increased with (Z)-9-tricosene concentration even up to very high levels. However, in repeated trials, and despite mass release of marked flies, catch rates appeared to be insufficient to provide adequate control. We suggest that this is probably because (Z)-9-tricosene is primarily a short-range attractant, and fly populations in outdoor situations are generally distributed over a large area. Catch declined rapidly to zero within 2 weeks, indicating that improved formulation or target design is needed to slow the weathering of active ingredients on the targets. It seems unlikely that (Z)-9-tricosene is sufficiently attractive to houseflies to provide an effective and economic lure in outdoor situations.",2004,128,478,482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2004.00876.x

Water dispersible granule (WDG) formulation of DOR Bt-127 - a native strain of B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki was prepared by a combination of agglomeration and pan drying method using a binder (guar gum), a wetting agent (Tween-80) and a water-soluble carrier (starch). WDG had good wettability and was effective against S. litura. X-ray diffraction studies revealed semi-crystalline nature of WDG formulation. FTIR spectra of Bt WDG formulation revealed change in transmittance peaks to 1631, 1547 and 1147 cm(-1) from 1636, 1534 and 1075 cm(-1) of Bt (technical) indicating binding of Bt with starch and guar gum. The formulation has a high protein content of 134.7 mg/g and potency of 74,200 SU/mg against 9 days old S. litura larvae. Pot culture studies and field trials revealed that efficacy of Bt-127 WDG formulation was on par with the commercial Btk formulation against 7 and 9 days old larvae.

In surface waters within the agricultural landscape, however, contamination is usually characterized by complex pesticide mixtures. To estimate the joint effects caused by these complex mixtures, mathematical models have been proposed. Among these, the model of concentration addition (CA) is suggested as default model for the risk assessment of chemical mixtures as it is considered protective for mixtures composed of similar and dissimilar acting substances. Here we assessed the suitability of CA predictions for seven field relevant pesticide mixtures using acute (immobility) and chronic (reproduction) responses of the standard test species Daphnia magna. Pesticide mixtures indicated largely additive or less than additive effects when using CA model predictions as a reference. Moreover, we revealed that deviations from CA predictions are lower for chronic (up to 3.2-fold) relative to acute (up to 7.2-fold) response variables. Additionally, CA predictions were in general more accurate for complex mixtures relative to those composed of only a few pesticides. Thus, this study suggests CA models as largely protective for the risk assessment of pesticide mixtures justifying its use as default model. At the same time, extrapolating conclusions about the joint effects of pesticides from acute to chronic responses is uncertain, due to partly large discrepancies with regards to the deviation of model prediction and observed effects between exposure scenarios.

The IATA were developed to assess the applicability of the DNT in vitro testing battery (IVB), designed to explore fundamental neurodevelopmental processes, in the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides. For this purpose, an evidence-based-approach methodology was applied: 1) systematic literature review and critical appraisal of all the evidence i.e. human observational studies, in vivo data from rodent models and new approach methodologies (NAMs, i.e. in vitro studies including high-throughput testing from IVB and zebrafish studies from the literature) for both case studies; 2) a quantitative uncertainty analysis of all the evidence using expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) and a probabilistic approach; 3) integration of all the evidence using the AOP conceptual framework. This stepwise approach resulted in the postulation of an evidence-based AOP network for one of the case studies. A probabilistic quantification of the weight of evidence (WoE) using Bayesian network analysis allowed the assessment and the quantification of the uncertainty in the postulated AOP. The approach taken allowed conclusions to be drawn with an acceptable level of certainty in DNT hazard identification and characterisation of deltamethrin and that flufenacet is not a developmental neurotoxicant, supporting the relevance of the mechanistic understanding. The case studies show the applicability of the DNT-IVB for hazard identification and characterisation and illustrate the usefulness of an AOP-informed IATA for regulatory decision making. The overall activity led to improved interpretation of human data by providing a plausible mechanistic link to adverse outcomes, which would support their contextualisation in the risk assessment process. This Scientific Opinion allows the PPR Panel to draft several recommendations for the implementation of the AOP-informed IATA methodology and of the DNT-IVB in the regulatory risk assessment of pesticides.

The aim of this study was to select effective biotests for a test battery to assess the potential effects of pesticides on aquatic life. Thirteen widely used and registered pesticides in Poland, with potassium dichromate as a reference chemical, as well as seven different test species (ranging from protozoan to fish) were chosen for the study. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used as helpful statistical methods for the selection of the test battery. PCA clearly isolated two components that explained almost 82% of total variance. The first consists of all crustacean and fish tests while the second of all tests with algae and the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. In other words, PCA separated unicellular and multicellular organisms in regard to their sensitivity to pesticides. CA has confirmed the above results and has provided more detailed insight into the connections within the separated group of biotests. Regression analysis, PCA, and CA allowed for the selection of the following test battery: Algaltoxkit F(TM) (Raphidocelis subcapitata), Protoxkit F(TM) (T. thermophila), Daphnia magna (Fluotox), and an acute test with Oncorhynchus mykiss or, alternatively, Thamnotoxkit F(TM) (Thamnocephalus platyurus).

The study showed that clay in the preblends of up to 50% had rather small effects on encapsulation efficiency and release rates of the products in water. As little as 20% starch in the blends remarkably slowed the release rates compared to that of clay alone.

In the present study, the authors investigated the hydrolytic enzyme activity of D. magna after exposure to toxicant stress. In vivo enzyme activity was quantified using 15 fluorogenic enzyme probes based on 4-methylumbelliferyl or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Probing D. magna enzyme activity was evaluated using short-term exposure (24-48 h) to the reference chemical K2Cr2O7 or the herbicide formulation Roundup (R). Toxicant-induced changes in hydrolytic enzyme activity were compared with changes in mobility (International Organization for Standardization standard 6341). The results showed that hydrolytic enzyme activity was quantifiable as a combination of whole body fluorescence of D. magna and the fluorescence of the surrounding water. Exposure of D. magna to lethal and sublethal concentrations of Roundup resulted in loss of whole body enzyme activity and release of cell constituents, including enzymes and DNA. Roundup caused comparable inhibition of mobility and alkaline phosphatase activity with median effective concentration values at 20 degrees C of 8.7mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L to 11.7mga.i./L. Inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity by Roundup was lowest at 14 degrees C and greater at 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C.

A linear correlation was obtained between the time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released (T-50) into water and granule size of the CRFs. Besides, a linear correlation was reached between T-50 values in water and soil. Mobility experiments carried out in calcareous soil show that the use of lignin-based CRFs reduces the presence of both herbicides in the leachate compared to the technical grade products. The set of experiments developed in this research can be useful to design, prepare and evaluate formulations with CR properties which can reduce the pollution derived from the use of herbicides.

Spray solution and herbicide activity can be influenced by adjuvants in many ways. Dividing adjuvants into particular groups is often complicated as they can influence more physical characteristics of spray solution and we still miss detailed terminology. From the point of view of their function we can classify them as surfactants, colorants - spray indicators, drift control agents, foam adjuvants, thickeners, deposition adjuvants, adhesive agents, antifoam agents, water conditioning agents, buffering agents, UV absorbents etc. The most important group of adjuvants is represented by surfactants. These agents enhance biological activity of herbicides by increasing and accelerating the penetration of active ingredient into leaf tissue. Surfactant molecules are amphipatic - composed of two parts, each of them attracted by different phase. One end of the molecule (head group) is hydrophilic while the other (tail) is hydrophobic, creating a bridge between two phases and thus decreasing surface tension of spray drops. Following agents are used as surfactatns: mineral and plant (mostly esterified) oils, or synthetic compounds like dissociable salts or esters, non-ionic surfactants based on alcohols and fatty acids, organosilicates and other chemicals.",2011,127,384,388,NA

However, these plants may be at significant ecotoxico-logical risk from pesticides applied in crop fields. The fungicide azoxystrobin (AZX) induces DNA damage and changes in the antioxidant enzymatic system in leaves of the submerged hydrophyte Myriophyllum quitense. In the present study, the objectives were to determine whether AZX induces chromosomal damage in roots of the wetland plant Bidens laevis and to evaluate whether the damage in the antioxidant system was associated with damage in the photosynthetic system. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the short-term effects (1 or 2 days) of the exposure to different concentrations of the active ingredient of AZX (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 50,100 mu g/L) on intact B. laevis plants. In the first experiment, photosynthetic biomarkers, including chlorophyll a fluorescence, SPAD units, and chlorophyll a and b content, were measured. In the second experiment, the frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) was evaluated in root tips. In general, the photosynthetic biomarkers evaluated were not affected by AZX, except for a decrease in chlorophyll b content at 100 mu g/L. Total CA increased at all AZX concentrations and the most frequent abnormalities were laggards and chromosomes not congregated at the metaphase equator, both indicators of spindle disturbance. This is the first report of AZX-induced chromosomal aberrations in a wetland plant exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the fungicide. The reason why AZX exposure had only a limited impact on biomarkers of the photosynthetic apparatus is discussed.",2019,35,553,563,http://dx.doi.org/10.20937/RICA.2019.35.03.03

(Diptera: Muscidae) is permanent pests in livestock facilities. High fly density in livestock and poultry farms can increase the risks of economic loss and public health. Treatment with toxic baits is one of the methods for housefly control. However, development of resistance to insecticides makes it difficult to manage of flies. Anti-resistance strategies include the use of multiple pesticides with different modes of action. Aim: This study was conducted to estimate the efficacy of neonicotinoid acetamiprid and phenylpyrazole fipronil, applied alone or in the mixture, against adults of M. domestica and to evaluate the efficacy of fly bait formulations containing acetamiprid and fipronil under laboratory conditions. Materials and Methods: The adult flies, M. domestica of laboratory strain, were used in laboratory bioassays. The efficacy of acetamiprid and fipronil as technical substances, when applied alone and in the mixture, against adult flies was tested by no-choice feeding bioassays. The insecticidal efficacy of bait formulations (wet powder) with acetamiprid or fipronil or their mixture was tested against flies by choice feeding bioassays. The probit analysis was used to calculate lethal concentrations of insecticides, and the chi(2) test was used to analyze the interaction between fipronil and acetamiprid in the mixture. Results: Fipronil was more toxic to adults of M. domestica than acetamiprid in laboratory tests. Lethal concentrations for 50% mortality (95% confidence interval) of flies were 0.0159% (0.0124-0.0205) of acetamiprid and 0.000119% (0.0000390.0002640) of fipronil. The mixture containing fipronil at concentration 0.005% and acetamiprid at concentration 0.05% had the additive effect on fly mortality. Conclusion: The results of laboratory feeding bioassays indicate that the mixture of fipronil and acetamiprid might have a potential to use in toxic bait formulations against houseflies.",2018,11,953,958,http://dx.doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2018.953-958

Previous studies indicated that fungicide applications are profitable under high disease pressure when applied during the tasseling to silking growth stages. Few comprehensive studies in corn have examined the impact of fungicide applications at an early vegetative growth stage (V6) compared to late application timings (VT) for yield response and return on fungicide investment (ROI) across multiple locations. Objective Compare yield response of fungicide application timing across multiple fungicide classes and calculate the probability of positive ROI. Methods Data were collected specifically for this analysis using a uniform protocol conducted in 13 states in the United States and one province in Canada from 2014-2015. Data were subjected to a primary mixed-model analysis of variance. Subsequent univariate meta-analyses, with and without moderator variables, were performed using standard meta-analytic procedures. Follow-up power and prediction analyses were performed to aid interpretation and development of management recommendations. Results Fungicide application resulted in a range of yield responses from -2,683.0 to 3,230.9 kg/ha relative to the non-treated control, with 68.2% of these responses being positive. Evidence suggests that all three moderator variables tested (application timing, fungicide class, and disease base level), had some effect (alpha = 0.05) on the absolute difference in yield between fungicide treated and non-treated plots ((D) over bar). Application timing influenced (D) over bar, with V6 + VT and the VT application timings resulting in greater yield responses than the V6 application timing alone. Fungicide formulations that combined demethylation inhibitor and quinone outside inhibitor fungicides significantly increased yield response. Conclusion Foliar fungicide applications can increase corn grain yield. To ensure the likelihood of a positive ROI, farmers should focus on applications at VT and use fungicides that include a mix of demethylation inhibitor and quinone outside inhibitor active ingredients.",2019,14,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217510

Tick control can be achieved with chemical acaricides, but issues remain regarding their safety as well as emerging tick resistance. Propylene glycol alginate (PGA) is a food additive commonly used in China. It has been used to kill whiteflies in agriculture as an environmentally friendly insecticide. The aims of this study were to (i) explore the efficacy of PGA to kill Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks and (ii) assess the potential to develop a new tick control acaricide containing PGA and a reduced amount of synthetic pyrethroid. Beta-cypermethrin was chosen as the reference pyrethroid in this study. PGA, beta-cypermethrin and mixes (PGA and beta-cypermethrin formulated in proportions of A = 2:1, B = 1:1, and C = 1:2) were compared for efficacy to kill larval and adult H. longicornis ticks. Overall, we found no statistically significant differences in the killing efficacy of PGA as compared to beta-cypermethrin across examined time-points post-tick exposure. At 24 h post-tick exposure, similar killing efficacy for H. longicornis larvae was recorded for beta-cypermethrin alone, PGA alone, and mixed formulations B and C. Mixed formulation C had the strongest killing effect when compared to PGA alone or mixed formulation B. Similar outcomes were observed in experiments with adult H. longicornis ticks.

The role of glyphosate in neurotoxicity has been reported in human and animal models. However, the detailed mechanism of the role of glyphosate in neuronal development remains unknown. Recently, several studies have reported evidence linking neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with gestational glyphosate exposure. The current group previously identified microRNAs (miRNAs) that are associated with the etiology of NDDs, but their expression levels in the developing brain following glyphosate exposure have not been characterized. In the present study, miRNA expression patterns were evaluated in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of 28 postnatal day mouse offspring following glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and lactation. An miRNA microarray detected 55 upregulated and 19 downregulated miRNAs in the PFC of mouse offspring, and 20 selected deregulated miRNAs were further evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 11 targets of these selected deregulated miRNAs were analyzed using bioinformatics. Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with the relevant miRNAs included neurogenesis (GO:0050769), neuron differentiation (GO:0030182) and brain development (GO:0007420). The genes Cdkn1a, Numbl, Notch1, Fosl1 and Lef1 are involved in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, which are closely associated with neural development. PCR arrays for the mouse Wnt and Notch signaling pathways were used to validate the effects of glyphosate on the expression pattern of genes involved in the Wnt and Notch pathways. Nr4a2 and Wnt7b were downregulated, while Dkk1, Dixdc1, Runx1, Shh, Lef-1 and Axin2 were upregulated in the PFC of mice offspring following glyphosate exposure during pregnancy and lactation. These results indicated abnormalities of the Wnt/beta-catenin and Notch pathways. These findings may be of particular interest for understanding the mechanism of glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity, as well as helping to clarify the association between glyphosate and NDDs.",2018,15,2457,2467,http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/etm.2017.5669

Keeping in view this problem, integrated pest management (IPM) modules were synthesized for rice crop and then compared with non-IPM/farmer's practice (NIPM). This study assisted in identifying pesticides with reduced risk to the environment. To measure and compare risks, environmental impact quotient (EIQ) has been used as a pesticide risk indicator model, between IPM and NIPM programs. Using this model, the field EIQ values (EIQ field use rating or EIQ-FUR), for 32 commonly used pesticides in the region, were evaluated based on dosage, frequency, and percent active ingredients present in the pesticide formulations. The results conclude that copper oxychloride (CuOCl2) (50WP at 1.25kg/ha) and mancozeb (75WP at 1.25kg/ha) were the most detrimental to arthropod parasitoids and were the highest contributors to environmental risk (13-16%), in rice crop. This is based on the comparison of total dosage and active ingredients of pesticides applied under IPM and NIPM, with the total field EIQ values. The IPM modules were observed to have least impact on natural enemies with 30-40% increase in population, while keeping the weed population below 10%. NIPM, on the other hand, had resulted in 20% reduction in crop yields, 50% reduction in biodiversity, and about 150% increase in weed population, relative to the control (untreated) rice fields. Moreover, NIPM practices had been observed to pose 56% greater risk as per the total field EIQ values (62 for IPM and 141 for NIPM).

Endpoints analysed include synthesis of steroid hormone production (progesterone and estradiol) and gene expression of steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cytochrome-P-450 (CYP) enzymes. For the triazoles and prochloraz, a dose dependent inhibition of progesterone production was observed and additive effects could be confirmed for several combinations of these substances in vitro. The non-triazoles chlorpyrifos and triflusulfuron-methyl did not affect this endpoint and, in line with this finding, no additivity was observed when these substances were applied in mixtures with prochloraz. While prochloraz slightly increased aromatase expression and estradiol production and triflusulfuron-methyl decreased estradiol production, none of the other substances had effects on the expression levels of steroidogenic CYP-enzymes in Jeg-3 cells. For some triazoles, prochloraz and chlorpyrifos a significant induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression and potential combination effects for this endpoint were observed. Inhibition of CYP1A1 mRNA induction by the AhR inhibitor CH223191 indicated AhR receptor dependence of this effect.",2014,11,9661,9680,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph110909660

The presence of different diseases in crops often leads to a misuse of the proper therapeutic, or the combination of different diseases forces the use of more than one pesticide. This work concerns the development of a 'super-Blad': a chimeric protein consisting of Blad polypeptide, the active ingredient of a biological fungicide already on the market, and two selected peptides, SP10-5 and Sub5, proven to possess biological potential as antibacterial agents. The resulting chimeric protein obtained from the fusion of Blad with SP10-5 not only maintained strong antibacterial activity, especially against Xanthomonas spp. and Pseudomonas syringae, but was also able to retain the ability to inhibit the growth of both yeast and filamentous fungi. However, the antibacterial activity of Sub5 was considerably diminished when fused with Blad, which seems to indicate that not all fusion proteins behave equally. These newly designed drugs can be considered promising compounds for use in plant protection. A deeper and focused development of an appropriate formulation may result in a potent biopesticide that can replace, per se, two conventional chemistries with less impact on the environment.",2018,164,11,19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.000592

PHB or PHBV microparticles containing ametryn were prepared and the efficiencies of herbicide association and loading were evaluated, presenting similar values of approximately 40%. The microparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which showed that the average sizes of the PHB and PHBV microparticles were 5.92 +/- 0.74 mu m and 5.63 +/- 0.68 mu m, respectively. The ametryn release profile was modified when it was encapsulated in the microparticles, with slower and more sustained release compared to the release profile of pure ametryn. When ametryn was associated with the PHB and PHBV microparticles, the amount of herbicide released in the same period of time was significantly reduced, declining to 75% and 87%, respectively. For both types of microparticle (PHB and PHBV) the release of ametryn was by diffusion processes due to anomalous transport (governed by diffusion and relaxation of the polymer chains), which did not follow Fick's laws of diffusion. The results presented in this paper are promising, in view of the successful encapsulation of ametryn in PHB or PHBV polymer microparticles, and indications that this system may help reduce the impacts caused by the herbicide, making it an environmentally safer alternative.

However, several recent studies showed its potential adverse health effects to humans as it may be an endocrine disruptor. This study focuses on the effects of pure glyphosate on estrogen receptors (ERs) mediated transcriptional activity and their expressions. Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer, T47D cells, but not in hormone-independent breast cancer, MDA-MB231 cells, at 10(-12) to 10(-6) M in estrogen withdrawal condition. The proliferative concentrations of glyphosate that induced the activation of estrogen response element (ERE) transcription activity were 5-13 fold of control in T47D-KBluc cells and this activation was inhibited by an estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, indicating that the estrogenic activity of glyphosate was mediated via ERs. Furthermore, glyphosate also altered both ER alpha and beta expression. These results indicated that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate possessed estrogenic activity. Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used for soybean cultivation, and our results also found that there was an additive estrogenic effect between glyphosate and genistein, a phytoestrogen in soybeans. However, these additive effects of glyphosate contamination in soybeans need further animal study. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, cattle were infested at weekly intervals for 13 consecutive weeks after treatment to determine the persistent effectiveness: of the three concentrations. Results of therapeutic efficacy of fipronil showed that with each increase in concentration there was a corresponding and often significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the numbers, fecundity and fertility of engorged females. The overall control of the Index of Reproduction (IR) achieved at 0.25 and 0.5% AI was 86.2 and 93.3%, respectively, while the control of the IR at the 1.0% AI concentration was 99.7%. The persistent efficacy of fipronil, like the therapeutic efficacy, was also dose related. The 0.25% AI treatment failed to provide complete protection (100%) against larval reinfestation, although control of the IR remained high (> 95%) for the first 6 weeks after treatment. In contrast, at 0.5% AI the control of the IR remained at 100% for the first 4 weeks after treatment, and was > 90% for an additional 2 weeks (6 weeks posttreatment). The 1.0% AI concentration afforded the longest residual activity, providing virtually 100% protection against larval reinfestation for 8 weeks after treatment was applied. Based on the results, neither the 0.25 or 0.5% AI concentration completely eliminated the immature stages of the tick (nymphs and larvae) on the host at the time of treatment (therapeutic efficacy), and the residual activity (persistent efficacy) did not prevent reinfestation by lan ae for long periods after treatment. While the 1.0% Al concentration provided both therapeutic and residual efficacy thar would be suitable for use in the eradication program, caution is still warranted because a few engorged females detached for up to 25 days after treatment, although none reproduced after the 6th day.

Spinosad was applied at four dose rates: 20, 100, 500 and 1000 ppm of the formulation, corresponding to 0.025, 0.125, 0.625 and 1.25 ppm of active ingredient, respectively. Adult mortality was measured after 7 and 14 days of exposure in the treated substrate, while progeny production was assessed after the removal of the parental adults. For R. dominica, adult mortality was high and reached 100% at doses >= 0.125 ppm of a.i. after 14 days of exposure. In contrast, mortality of S. oryzae adults was >95% after 14 days of exposure only at 1.25 ppm of a.i. With the same exposure interval, no significant differences were noted in R. dominica mortality levels among the three grains tested, while mortality of S. oryzae was significantly higher on wheat than on barley and maize. More adult progeny were recorded for S. oryzae than for R. dominica. A simple and reliable method using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method (LC/MS) was developed for the precise and selective quantitative determination of spinosyns residues in wheat, barley and maize grains. Spinosad dissipation on different commodities such as maize, barley and wheat differed significantly. Accelerated degradation of spinosad was observed in maize grains 14 days after application; the concentration of spinosad was slightly decreased in barley, but in the case of wheat a negligible degradation of spinosad was observed. These findings suggest that the reduced mortality of S. oryzae in maize is probably due to the high degree of pesticide degradation.",2008,54,277,285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670870802010849

They are commonly controlled with fungicides which may have negative impact on human health and the environment. A more sustainable plant protection can be based on carbohydrate biopolymers because they are biodegradable and may act as antifungal compounds, effective elicitors or carriers of active ingredients. We reviewed recent applications of three common polysaccharides (chitosan, alginate and cellulose) to crop protection against pathogenic fungi. We distinguished treatments dedicated for seed sowing material, field applications and coating of harvested fruits and vegetables. All reviewed biopolymers were used in the three types of treatments, therefore they proved to be versatile resources for development of plant protection products. Antifungal activity of the obtained polymer formulations and coatings is often enhanced by addition of biocontrol microorganisms, preservatives, plant extracts and essential oils. Carbohydrate polymers can also be used for controlled-release of pesticides. Rapid development of nanotechnology resulted in creating new promising methods of crop protection using nanoparticles, nano-/micro-carriers and electrospun nanofibers.

In order to reduce the photodegradation of pesticides, and so increase their killing activity against target pests, chitosan-coated beeswax solid lipid nanoparticles (CH-BSLNs) were prepared by a combination of hot homogenization and sonication, with deltamethrin as an active ingredient. RESULTS: Under optimal conditions, the highest encapsulation efficiency (95%) and a high payload of deltamethrin (approximately 12.5%) were achieved. In direct photolysis, in the case of CH-BSLNs after UV irradiation for 24 h, 37.3% of deltamethrin remained, as opposed to only 14.6% of the free-form deltamethrin. In addition, in indirect photolysis, in the case of CH-BSLNs after UV irradiation for 2 h in 2% acetone solution, approximately 74.5% of deltamethrin remained, as opposed to only 37.6% of the free-form deltamethrin. CONCLUSION: CH-BSLNs showed good protection for deltamethrin against photodegradation.

Three light-textured soils with a pH range of 5.8-8.5 were used for this work. An oat bioassay (Avena sativa L.) was used to quantify soil concentrations of the herbicides. Comparison of the initial bioefficacy of controlled-release formulations of atrazine and simazine showed their respective relative potencies to conventional formulations to be 0.51-0.85. The results indicated that the controlled-release formulations maintained an entrapped reserve of active ingredient after delivery with a conventional boomsprayer. In laboratory trials, the controlled-release formulations showed a reduction in leaching compared with conventional formulations. A controlled-release formulation and a conventional formulation of atrazine were tested further in a field trial. A higher concentration of atrazine in topsoil from the controlled-release formulation was observed 11 weeks after application after 107 mm of rainfall. It was deduced that this was caused by reduced leaching of the controlled-release formulation, as observed in laboratory trials. EWRC scores for the control of a range of grass and broad-leaved weeds were identical for both formulations. This indicated that, while the controlled-release formulation could inhibit leaching of the active ingredient, it did not hinder the level of potency necessary for early weed control. EWRC crop safety ratings of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) sown at application were higher for the controlled-release formulation 10 weeks after sowing, and subsequent harvest yields were 50% higher.

The combination of the well-known amidosulfuron with the new active ingredient iodo sulfuron-methyl-sodium enables a wider efficacy for the control of broadleaved weeds i.e. mayweed species (Matricaria spp.), common chickweed (Stellaria media), cruciferous weeds e.g. volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp.). The secondary effect against silky bent-grass (Apera spica-venti) can be used in different solutions for weed control. With the product concept of HOESTAR SUPER the known advantages of Hoestar i.e. safe control of cleavers, wide application window and high dose flexibility are completed by new features i.e. wider efficacy and optimum combination with grass weed herbicides. HOESTAR SUPER has a high selectivity in cereals which is achieved by including the safener Mefenpyr-diethyl into the formulation. It is not possible to use HOESTAR SUPER in oats. HOESTAR SUPER is a user-friendly water soluble granule and can be used in winter cereals from the start of vegetation until the last leave is visible (BBCH 37). In spring cereals the use is possible from 3 leaves unfolded (BBCH 13) until second node detectable (BBCH 32). According to the existing weed situation HOESTAR SUPER can be used both as straight product (150-200 g/ha) or in tank mix (from 100 g/ha) with a suited partner. The publication is based on a longstanding period of trials investigating the biological efficacy and crop selectivity. Information about the range of application of HOESTAR SUPER in combination with grass weed herbicides for the control of broadleaved weeds and grass weeds is discussed.",2002,NA,695,702,NA

The systems were based on three nonionic surfactants (Cremophor EL, Brij 35, Tween 80). The MEs showed dispersed phase diameters in the range of 8 to 14 nm and had low PDI values (<0.2). The MEs were analyzed by TEM, indicating that they had nearly spherical morphology. The microemulsified systems based on geranium EO and those of geraniol produced a notable increase of the larvicidal activity when compared with the respectably emulsions, concluding that the biological effect is related with the diameter of the dispersed phase. The smallest drops achieved the highest larvicidal activity, being the aqueous nanoformulations based on geraniol most effective than those of geranium EO.

Bednets and indoor residual spray formulations containing alternative active ingredients have shown promise in field trials but are still several years away fromimplementation. As existing insecticides become less effective at killing mosquitoes in the countries with the highest burden of malaria, there is growing concern that the advances made in reducing malaria transmission will be eroded by insecticide resistance.

While formulation strategies and adjuvants are known to affect the fate of active ingredient, no general volatilisation reducing guidelines exist for formulation purposes. Moreover, as limited information on formulation effects is available, current pesticide fate models lack parameters characterising reduction of active ingredient volatilisation. The objective of this study was to investigate the volatilisation reducing potential of formulation types and adjuvants, and to propose an effective vapour pressure for pesticide fate modelling. Several formulations of fenpropimorph, pyrimethanil and tebuconazole were produced and tested in a wind tunnel to evaluate the effect of formulation on active ingredient volatilisation. Produced emulsifiable concentrates with high volatile solvents did not offer any reduction in volatilisation, while the low volatile solvent reduced the volatilisation of pyrimethanil and fenpropimorph with 79.2 and 52.9%, respectively. The microemulsion reduced the volatilisation of fenpropimorph, pyrimethanil and tebuconazole with 57.6, 57.8 and 49.8%, respectively. High surfactant-active ingredient ratios (100:1) reduced the volatilisation of applied amount of pyrimethanil with 50%, on average. The effective vapour pressure of pyrimethanil formulated as a commercial available suspension concentrate was reduced by 33.8%. The commercial available emulsifiable concentrate did not reduce volatilisation of fenpropimorph. Effective vapour pressures of formulated fenpropimorph and pyrimethanil were determined and showed a high correlation with the amount volatilised within 48 h.

The sorption behavior was studied by means of batch experiments including a comparison of the pure and formulated active ingredient. Thereby, we could not detect any effect of the tested formulation Gesaprim(R). Sorption could be described best by the Freundlich isotherm with K-f values ranging from 1.36 to 5.79. Normalizing the sorbed concentration to the organic carbon content of the soils reduced the variability between soils substantially. The corresponding K-f values varied between 69 and 118. Since the non-linearity of the isotherms was only weak, we could describe the sorption also by linear isotherms. The resulting K-OC values ranged between 69 and 122 with an average K-OC for all data of 91. Based on these findings and the organic carbon contents of the corn fields we calculated the potential of the soils to mobilize atrazine into runoff water. We did so for the subcatchments of the study area where we had monitored the atrazine loads in the stream after a controlled field application in 2000. This allowed to compare the mobilization potential to the actual losses. The predicted mobilization potential varied only moderately by factors less than three between the subcatchments. In contrast, the loads differed by at least a factor of 18 between the two extreme subcatchments. Probably, it was mainly the soil hydrology and the connectivity between fields and open waters that controlled the spatial transport pattern.

To date, urban mosquito management can be summarized as dependent on the theme of recruiting the public to invest in their own protection. This effort takes the form of source reduction education programs and accompanying personal protection guidelines. However, the topical repellents that form the cornerstone of our personal protection guidelines are available in equal measure with spatial repellents. Spatial repellents commonly include volatile pyrethroids as active ingredients, which easily transition into a vapor phase, that are formulated into mosquito coils, vaporizers, emanators, or heated mats. These formulations are available on the global market. Consumers frequently choose spatial repellents, and existing literature indicates this choice has merits. This predicament forces integrated vector management to adapt to and understand tools that consumers selectively employ. At present, there is little information differentiating the effects of vapor-active pyrethroids from the contact efficacies we recognize from well-utilized pyrethroids. To address this, volatile pyrethroids need to have their multiple effects identified, defined, and described to maximize their utility for preventing mosquito biting and, thus, pathogen transmission.

Short-term responses of dung beetles to carbamate carbosulfan (Marshal (R), ultra low-volume formulation, 100 g active ingredient ha(-1)) were assessed during desert locust control operations at five sites within two major biotopes: Acacia tortilis shrubland and cultivated wetland; on the Red Sea Coast of Sudan. The study took place during January-February 2004. At each site, fresh dung from Zebu cows was placed in areas targeted for desert locust control. Dung pats were placed in plots in two areas and left for 24 h, before and after insecticide application. Beetles were extracted by floatation.

In contrast, it was found that Aphodius lucidus and beetles at the subfamily level of Aphodiinae increased in numbers after insecticide treatment. Mortality and sublethal impacts as well as a repellent effect of the insecticide may explain the decrease in Onthophagus margaritifer, while the increase in Aphodiinae beetles could be an indirect response to lower numbers of Scarabaeinae beetles in competing for the same resource. These organisms and the applied methodology may be useful for environmental monitoring of desert locust control, thus further studies are suggested.

To understand the mechanism for these changes, detailed knowledge of the products present and their effects on anti-AChE potential deserves attention. It was likely that the basis for these changes was methanol, the cosolvent of CP EC, because when the purified CP was stored in methanol at 50 degrees C for 2 weeks, CP drop and toxic potentiation similar to those observed in CP EC also appeared.

In this study, a series of behavioural experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of CFG on honeybees. The results showed that there was a significant decline in water responsiveness at 1/2x, 1xand 2xthe RC after 3 h of exposure to CFG for 11 days. The CFG significantly reduced sucrose responsiveness at 1/2xand 1xthe RC. In addition, CFG significantly affected olfactory learning ability at 1/2x, 1x, and 2xthe RC and negatively affected memory ability at 1/2xand 1xthe RC. The climbing ability of honeybees also significantly decreased at 1/2x, 1xand 2xthe RC. Our findings indicated that, after they were chronically exposed to CFG at the RC, honeybees exhibited behavioural changes. These results provide a theoretical basis for regulating field applications of CFG, which is necessary for establishing an early warning and notification system and for protecting honeybees.",2021,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80445-4

Regulatory requirements and the aquatic phytotoxicity database need to be improved to reflect the importance of aquatic plants. Based on a review of the scientific literature and results from laboratory testing with the submersed macrophyte Myriophyllum sibiricum Komarov, the effects of 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), glyphosate, hexazinone, imazapyr, metsulfuron methyl, sulfometuron methyl, acid triclopyr on nontarget aquatic organisms were compared. laboratory results indicate that M, sibiricum is sensitive to herbicide effects, especially those that impact root growth. For most herbicides, the inhibitory concentrations 25 and 50 (IC25 and IC50, concentrations that inhibit an endpoint parameter by 25 and 50%, respectively) for shoot and root growth were below the expected environmental concentrations (EEC). For example, the IC50 values for root dry mass were 0.000 12 and 0.000 22 mg active ingredient/L for sulfometuron methyl and metsulfuron methyl, respectively, concentrations that were approximately 3100 and 1700 times below the EEC for these compounds. Interspecies comparisons, conducted during this study, demonstrated that M. sibiricum was generally equally or more sensitive to these herbicides than other aquatic plant species (i.e., floating macrophytes and algae) and, in some cases, mon sensitive than fish, zooplankton, and other invertebrates. For example, available data demonstrated that 2,4-D, imazapyr, and the sulfonylureas investigated were more toxic to rooted and floating macrophytes than to other aquatic organisms, including algae.

Factors contributing to the decline of mussel populations likely include pesticides and other aquatic contaminants: however, there is a paucity of data regarding the toxicity of even the most globally distributed pesticides, including glyphosate. to mussels. Therefore, the toxicity of several forms of glyphosate, its formulations, and a surfactant (MON 0818) used in several glyphosate formulations was determined for early life stages of Lampsilis siliquoidea, a native freshwater mussel. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were performed with a newly established American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard guide for conducting toxicity tests with freshwater mussels. Roundup's, its active ingredient, the technical-grade isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate, IPA alone, and MON 0818 (the surfactant in Roundup formulations) were each acutely toxic to L. siliquoidea glochidia. MON 0818 was most toxic of the compounds tested and the 48-h median effective concentration (0.5 mg/L) for L. siliquoidea glochidia is the lowest reported for any aquatic organism tested to date. Juvenile L. siliquoidea were also acutely sensitive to MON 0818. Roundup, glyphosate IPA salt, and IPA alone.

This result, therefore, questions the manner in which gloves are often selected for protection against pesticide formulations (by selecting the glove that offers the best protection against the formulation solvent rather than the active ingredient). Although this is a preliminary study, it is recommended that, to gain the maximum protective effect, all selected gloves are tested using the formulation of choice and that the permeation of all components of the formulation is monitored and reported.

Permeation tests were conducted with dilute formulations and concentrates of seven pesticide formulations. The duration time of 15 min was used for tests conducted with concentrates because operators are required to remove the gloves immediately in the case of an accidental spill.

The objective of this work was to evaluate enzymatic and structural changes in Pantoea ananatis, a strain isolated from water, in response to exposure to this herbicide. Despite degradation of mesotrione, probably due a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pathway in Pantoea ananatis, this herbicide induced oxidative stress by increasing hydrogen peroxide production. Thiol fragments, eventually produced after mesotrione degradation, could be involved in increased GST activity. Nevertheless, there was no peroxidation damage related to this production, as malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis, which is due to lipid peroxidation, was highest in the controls, followed by the mesotrione-and Callisto (R)-treated cultures at log growth phase. Therefore, P. ananatis can tolerate and grow in the presence of the herbicide, probably due an efficient control of oxidative stress by a polymorphic catalase system. MDA rates depend on lipid saturation due to a pattern change to a higher level of saturation. These changes are likely related to the formation of GST-mesotrione conjugates and mesotrione degradation-specific metabolites and to the presence of cytotoxic adjuvants. These features may shift lipid membrane saturation, possibly providing a protective effect to bacteria through an increase in membrane impermeability. This response system in P. ananatis provides a novel model for bacterial herbicide tolerance and adaptation in the environment.",2016,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13568-016-0240-x

Analyses of reaction products indicate each safener can undergo stepwise hydrogenolysis (replacement of chlorine by hydrogen) in each system at near-neutral pH. The first hydrogenolysis step generates compounds similar (in one case, identical) to herbicide active ingredients. Rates of product formation and (when reactions were sufficiently fast) parent loss were quantified; reaction rates in heterogeneous systems spanned 2 orders of magnitude and were strongly influenced by R-group structure. The length of n-alkyl R-groups exerted opposite effects on hydrogenolysis rates in homogeneous versus heterogeneous systems: as R-group size increased, reduction rates in heterogeneous systems increased, whereas reduction rates in the homogeneous system decreased. Branched alkyl R-groups decreased hydrogenolysis rates relative to their straight-chain homologues in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.

Today, an effective and scientifically grounded method of rodent control is an integrated approach that ensures the implementation of a full range of veterinary and sanitary measures. The existing chemical agents for combating synanthropic rodents for their improper use can contribute to the formation of rodents that are not sensitive to their action. The work aimed to develop an innovative bait to comb mouse-like rodents and establish its effectiveness in laboratory and production conditions. Based on the results of the studies, formulations of an innovative import-substituting bait for combating rodents were developed: bromadiolone (2.0-2.5%), sunflower oil (2.5-3.0%), sugar (1.0-1.5%), wheat (up to 100%). After giving them bait, the death of white outbred mice was noted within seven days and white outbred rats-within four days by the experiment. When the bait was fed to house mice (Mus musculus) and gray rats (Rattus rattus), their death was noted within 12 and within seven days, respectively. We proved that synanthropic rodents are more resistant to the action of rodenticide bait compared to laboratory animals.

Emamectin benzoate is the active ingredient in Slice((R)), an in-feed pesticide formulation used to control parasitic sea lice in salmon aquaculture. The comparative sensitivity of three life stages (nauplii, copepodites, adults) of four common marine copepods (Acartia clausi, Pseudocalanus elongatus, Temora longicornis and Oithona similis) was assessed in 48-h exposures followed by a recovery period in toxicant-free sea water. The calanoid copepods responded similarly to emamectin benzoate and EC50 values were significantly lower than those for the cyclopoid O. similis. Nauplii and copepodite 48-h EC50 values were generally lower than those for the adults. EC50 values ranged from 0.12 mug/l (P. elongatus nauplii) to 232 mug/l (O. similis adults). The primary toxic effect, immobilisation, was generally irreversible. A 7-day sublethal test with adult A. clausi females measured a significant reduction in egg production at higher concentrations. The no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) and lowest-observed-effect-concentration (LOEC) values were 0.05 and 0.158 mug/l, respectively. Concentrations causing toxicity to planktonic copepods were considerably higher than Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) in the vicinity of treated salmon farms and suggest that the use of emamectin benzoate for lice control is unlikely to adversely affect plank-tonic copepods.

However, previous research has shown that the performance of an adjuvant is dependent on the herbicide with which it is applied, the plant species, and environmental conditions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of adjuvants on these physical properties when glyphosate and lactofen are applied alone and in combination and to determine if these changes can be correlated to herbicide efficacy. The impact of the addition of the adjuvants into the treatment solutions was greater on viscosity than on density values. Overall, adjuvants significantly decreased the SFT of treatment solutions when compared to either water or herbicides alone. In addition, reduced. CA was observed due to the reduction in surface tension. However, results were adjuvant- and species-dependent. Herbicide efficacy was only partially explained by the changes in these physical properties.

Its market is growing steadily concurrently with the cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant transgenic crops and emergence of weeds less sensitive to glyphosate. Ephemeral and lentic waters near to agricultural lands, representing favorite habitats for amphibian reproduction and early life-stage development, may thus be contaminated by glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs) residues. Previous studies on larval anuran species highlighted increased mortality and growth effects after exposure to different GBHs in comparison to glyphosate itself, mainly because of the surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine present in the formulations. Nevertheless, these conclusions are not completely fulfilled when the early development, characterized by primary organogenesis events, is considered. In this study, we compare the embryotoxicity of Roundup((R)) Power 2.0, a new GBH formulation currently authorized in Italy, with that of technical grade glyphosate using the Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay Xenopus (FETAX). Our results evidenced that glyphosate was not embryolethal and only at the highest concentration (50 mg a.e./L) caused edemas. Conversely, Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 exhibited a 96 h LC50 of 24.78 mg a.e./L and a 96 h EC50 of 7.8 mg a.e./L. A Teratogenic Index of 3.4 was derived, pointing out the high teratogenic potential of the Roundup((R)) Power 2.0. Specific concentration-dependent abnormal phenotypes, such as craniofacial alterations, microphthalmia, narrow eyes and forebrain regionalization defects were evidenced by gross malformation screening and histopathological analysis. These phenotypes are coherent with those evidenced in Xenopus laevis embryos injected with glyphosate, allowing us to hypothesize that the teratogenicity observed for Roundup((R)) Power 2.0 may be related to the improved efficacy in delivering glyphosate to cells, guaranteed by the specific surfactant formulation. In conclusion, the differences in GBH formulations should be carefully considered by the authorities, since sub-lethal and/or long-term effects (e.g. teratogenicity) can be significantly modulated by the active ingredient salt type and concentration of the adjuvants. Finally, the mechanistic toxicity of glyphosate and GBHs are worthy of further research.",2018,195,103,113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.12.007

Ideally insecticides used against mole crickets should induce quick knockdown or mortality to minimize damage caused by their tunneling. However, neurophysiological effects of insecticides on mole crickets are mostly unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate neurophysiological and toxic effects of several insecticides on tawny mole cricket (Scapteriscus vicinus Scudder) adults and nymphs, and potential synergy between pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides. Bifenthrin, fipronil, and the combination of bifenthrin + imidacloprid provided the fastest median mortality when injected. The combination of bifenthrin + imidacloprid elicited faster toxicity than either active ingredient alone. Imidacloprid, bifenthrin, and bifenthrin + imidacloprid caused immediate knockdown, whereas fipronil immobilized mole crickets within 1-2 h. Acephate, bifenthrin, fipronil, imidacloprid, and bifenthrin + imidacloprid caused significant neuroexcitation. Bifenthrin + imidacloprid resulted in greater increases of spontaneous neural activity than the additive effects of imidacloprid and bifenthrin alone. Excitatory compounds acting at sodium and chloride channels (bifenthrin and fipronil) were the most toxic against S. vicinus. Combining a sodium channel toxin (bifenthrin) and a synaptic toxin (imidacloprid) led to greater than additive neurophysiological and toxic effects, which to our knowledge provides the first documented evidence of synergistic neurological potentiation.

METHODS: We reviewed the published literature for studies investigating barrier treatments for mosquito control during the last 74 years (1944-2018). We searched databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to retrieve worldwide literature on barrier treatments. RESULTS : Forty-four studies that evaluated 20 active ingredients (AIs) and 21 formulated products against multiple mosquito species are included. Insecticides investigated for efficacy included organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], beta-hexachlorocyclohexane [BHC]), organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (bifenthrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin) as AIs. Study design varied with multiple methods used to evaluate effectiveness of barrier treatments. Barrier treatments were effective at lowering mosquito populations although there was variation between studies and for different mosquito species. Factors other than AI, such as exposure to rainfall and application equipment used, also influenced control efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Many of the basic questions on the effectiveness of barrier insecticide applications have been answered, but several important details still must be investigated to improve precision and impact on vector-borne pathogen transmission. Recommendations are made to assist future evaluations of barrier treatments for mosquito control and to limit the potential development of insecticide resistance.",2019,13,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1178630219859004

This presents a major problem for water companies in the UK where such waters are abstracted for production of potable drinking water supplies. Therefore, it is important to understand the sources, transport and fate of this emerging pollutant of concern in the aquatic environment. We monitored metaldehyde in two contrasting river catchments (River Dee (8 sites) and River Thames (6 sites)) over a twelve month period that coincided with the agricultural application period of the molluscicide. Spot samples of water were collected typically weekly or fortnightly. Chemcatcher (R) passive samplers were deployed consecutively every two weeks. At the River Dee, there was little variability in the concentrations of metaldehyde (<10-110 ng L-1) measured in the spot samples of water. The Chemcatcher (R) gave similar time-weighted average concentrations which were higher following increased rain fall events. At the River Thames, concentrations of metaldehyde varied more widely (<9-4200 ng L-1) with several samples exceeding 100 ng L-1.

For the fish estimated 96-hr LC(50) values were as follows: 2.12 (P. reticulata), 2.53 (C. carpio), 2.92 (T. rendalli) and 1.71 mg liter(-1) (O. mossambicus). In the chronic test reproduction of the exposed population was stimulated at the lowest two fenthion concentrations (0.1 and 0.6 ng liter(-1)), while reproductive impairment was recorded at concentrations varying from 1 to 10 ng liter(-1). Concentrations of fenthion measured in dams after spraying are given to indicate the levels of contamination that may occur. QSAR was used to estimate the toxicity of some fenthion metabolites.

Controls were untreated seed planted into both non-inoculated (natural) soil and soil inoculated with R. solani. Compared with the non-inoculated control, inoculation significantly increased root rot severity and reduced emergence by 27%, and yield by 31%. Under the inoculated conditions, none of the seed treatments significantly increased emergence or yield in all of the six trials when compared with the control. Allegiance (metalaxyl) plus Vitaflo-280 (carbathiin plus thiram) and Vitaflo-280 alone were the most effective seed treatments, increasing emergence in by 20 and 19% and yield by 21 and 26%, which were significantly better than the control in four and five trials for emergence and three and four trials for yield, respectively. Allegiance plus HEC5725 (HEC5725), Apron Maxx RTA (fludioxonil plus metalaxyl), and Maxim 480FS (fludioxonil) increased both emergence and yield in two trials and TFL RTU (metalaxyl plus trifloxystrobin) plus Yield Shield in one trial. There was no difference between seed treatment with Allegiance and the untreated control for all parameters, confirming that metalaxyl is ineffective to R. solani.

As cancer cells may have different sensitivities and the effect of the product containing glyphosate may be different from that produced by the active ingredient alone, including the Acceptable Occupational Exposure Level (AOEL=160 mu g/L) and the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI=830 mu g/L) determined by ANVISA, we used two human thyroid-derived cell lines, Nthy-ori 3-1 (from normal follicular cells) and TPC-1 (from papillary carcinoma), to test 15 different concentrations of Roundup (R) Original DI. Trypan blue (TB), CCK-8 and BrdU assays were used to evaluate cytotoxicity, metabolic activity and proliferation with 24h and 48h exposures in technical and biological triplicates. TB showed an important toxic effect, especially after 24h of exposure, in both cell lines. The AOEL concentration caused the death of 43% and 50% of the Nthy-ori and TPC-1 cells, respectively, in 24 h, while ADI resulted in 35% and 58% of cell death. After 48h of exposure, AOEL and ADI caused a lower number of dead Nthy-ori (33% and 18%) and TPC-1 (33% and 37%) cells, respectively, suggesting that the toxic effect of the product disappears and/or both strains have repair mechanisms that protect them from longer exposures. On the other hand, the CCK-8 assay showed that small concentrations of Roundup have a proliferative effect: 6.5 mu g/L increased the number of both Nthy-ori and TPC-1 cells at 24h, and the BrdU assay confirmed the stimulatory effect with a 321% increase in the absorbance of Nthy-ori cells at 48h. The herbicide produced even more frequent increases in the BrdU absorbance of TPC-1 cells, mainly at 24h. We conclude that thyroid cells exposed to Roundup present a nonmonotonic dual dose-response curve. Low concentrations of the pesticide, considered acceptable, cause significant cell death but also have an important proliferative effect, especially on TPC-1 cells.

Furthermore, in addition to the active ingredient, formulation adjuvants may improve insecticide efficiency, but also its impact on nontargeted organisms. Here the chlorantraniliprole effect and its interaction with adjuvant on the survival and qualitative parameters of progeny of the nontarget parasitoid Palmistichus elaeisis (Delvare and LaSalle) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) were studied.

Penetration accelerating adjuvants are known to increase the cuticular permeability and may alter the cuticular barrier to water loss. However, none or very little emphasis has been given to the impacts of adjuvants on crop water balance or drought tolerance, a very important factor affecting crop performance under water scarcity. Two model crops with strongly varying leaf traits, kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea) and apple (Malus domestica) seedlings were grown in controlled environments. Three adjuvants with varying solubility in the cuticle, i.e. octanol-water partition coefficients (logKow) were selected: rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and the surfactants alkyl polyglycoside (APG) and polyoxyethylated tallow amine (POEA). The higher the logKow of the adjuvant, the stronger was the increase of minimum epidermal conductance (g(min), an essential parameter describing plant drought tolerance). However, such effects depended on the physio-chemical properties of the leaf surface. In comparison to kohlrabi, the adjuvant effects on g(min), of apple leaves were relatively weak. The increase of g(min) was associated with a decrease in contact angle and with an alteration of the wax microstructure. Furthermore, POEA affected photochemical efficiency of kohlrabi leaves. Some adjuvants could have a temporal influence on transpirational water loss and g(min). At repeated applications, they might alter the effective water use and possibly reduce drought tolerance of some horticultural crops.",2018,132,229,237,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.08.042

Average concentrations of C8E4 in cuticles amounted to 8.1% and temperatures ranged from 15 to 35 degrees C. Activation energies of diffusion were constant for the temperature range studied with values of 160 kJ/mol (Citrus/bifenox), 132 kJ/mol (Citrus/2.4-D) and 119 kJ/mol (Pyrus/WL 110547). The sorption of C8E4 increased solute mobility at all temperatures but the effect decreased with increasing temperature. In presence of C8E4, activation energies decreased significantly. It is concluded, that the sorption of C8E4 and an increase in temperature act similar on the barrier properties of the cuticle. This corresponds to observations with synthetic polymers where both high temperatures and organic vapours or plasticizers increase segmental motion in polymer chains. The increase in mobility was larger with active ingredients having high molecular weights. It is concluded that using accelerator adjuvants is particularly beneficial when systemic compounds or herbicides with high molecular weight of the active ingredient must be sprayed on the foliage during cool seasons or during cool nights.",1998,105,84,94,NA

However, standard sampling procedures are invasive, requiring tissue, organ or blood extraction. This leads to concerns regarding conservation practice, animal welfare and restrictions in study design. New techniques are needed to avoid these problems, but still generate reliable data. Here, we aimed at validating the use of buccal swabs as a reliable method to detect pesticide exposure in reptiles. Common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) were divided into control, dermal and oral treatment groups and exposed to different pesticide formulations. Subsequently, buccal swabs were taken and enzymatic activity was analyzed. We were able to confirm the suitability of the method to detect effects of pesticide exposure on the enzymatic level. While exposure to the formulation Roundup Ultramax (R) didn't match when compared to effects previously observed in situ when compared to other glyphosate based formulations, effects could still be detected. This can be seen as a strong indicator that the active ingredient of a formulation may not always be the mian driver for ecotoxicological effectsat the enzymatic level. At the same time, exposure towards the single formulation Vivando (R) didn't result in any effects. However, individuals residing in agricultural landscapes will mostly be exposed to pesticide mixes containing different formulations. Our results strongly advocate that buccal swabbing is a reliable minimal invasive method to generate samples for detecting effects of pesticide exposure in reptiles. Due to its easy handling, we believe it will provide new opportunities concerning study designs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, commercially available products have a low residual activity, with the consequent need for multiple applications that inevitably increase costs and the risk of resistance phenomena insurgence. Smart delivery systems made of hydrogels proved their efficacy in increasing the action duration of biolarvicides up to several months, but the lack of an efficient baiting mechanism to strongly attract the target pest remains a problem in practical applications. In this work, we investigated two novel hydrogel-based formulations of completely natural composition for baiting and killing larvae of Aedes albopictus mosquitos. The proposed materials consist of charged crosslinked polysaccharides (chitosan and cellulose) and are specifically manufactured to float in water, simulating organic matter usually present at breeding sites. Within the hydrogels' matrix, yeast colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were embedded as phagostimulants alongside a biolarvicide (Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti)). Despite the similar chemical nature and structure, chitosan-based hydrogels exhibited a markedly superior baiting potential compared to those made of cellulose and also succeeded in efficiently killing mosquito larvae just after a few hours from administration. We are confident that the proposed smart delivery hydrogel made of chitosan can be an enabling tool to attract mosquito larvae towards biopesticides of different nature without delocalizing active ingredients away from the breeding site and to simultaneously increase their residual activity, thus holding the potential of minimizing environmental pollution related to pest control and vector-borne disease prevention.",2022,18,6443,6452,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2sm00889k

In this study, we used feeding methods to simulate in-hive exposures of formulated imidacloprid (Advise (R) 2FL) alone and mixtures with six representative pesticides for different classes. Advise, fed at 4.3 mg/L (equal to maximal residue detection of 912 ppb active ingredient [a.i.] in pollen) induced 36% mortality and 56% feeding suppression after 2-week feeding. Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (lambda-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a.i.). Our data demonstrated that residue levels of seven pesticide in pollens/hive may not adversely affect honey bees, but long term exclusive ingestion of the maximal residue levels of imidacloprid (912 ppb) and sulfoxaflor (3 ppm a.i.) may induce substantial bee mortality.

Two strains of paddy field isolates of free-living, diazotrophic filamentous forms of cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp. L. ACN 101 and Westiellopsis sp. L. ACW 101) were tested for their responses to glyphosate treatment under culture conditions. Both the strains of cyanobacteria tested, registered an EC 50 (effective concentration causing 50% inhibition in growth) of 65 muM measured in terms of their protein content. In Nostoc while a 140% enhancement in intracellular C-P lyase activity was recorded, the enzyme showed only a 30% increase in C-P lyase activity in the culture filtrates, compared to their respective controls under P minus and in the presence of glyphosate. However, the intracellular and the culture filtrate activities of alkaline phosphatase showed a 51% and 5% reduction compared to their respective control. On the contrary, in Westiellopsis while the intracellular C-P Iyase activity exhibited a 14% reduction, the enzyme activity in the culture filtrate was enhanced by 348%. Moreover, while the intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity registered a 233% enhancement, the enzyme activity was reduced by 12% in the culture filtrate. The patterns of induction kinetics of C-P lyase in the phosphate starved cultures exposed to glyphosate indicate that the optimum enzyme activity in the culture filtrate is obtainable between the 10th and 16th day in Westiellopsis and it was between 14th and 18th day in Nostoc. The magnitude of induction was nearly four-fold in Westiellopsis than Nostoc. Albeit the alkaline phosphatase showed a very high intracellular activity, its activity in the culture filtrate was not appreciable. This indicates that all the synthesized alkaline phosphatase is not excreted out into the environment. Between the two cyanobacteria, Westiellopsis has a more efficient machinery to degrade glyphosate compared to Nostoc, This has been substantiated by the rate of synthesis of the phycobiliprotein which paralleled with the periods of optimum C-P lyase activity in the culture filtrates of both the organisms experimented with.",2001,NA,195,206,NA

The present study is the first to develop a simulation model for estimating the fractions emitted to the air (f(air)), surface water (f(sw)), and the fractions that leach vertically (f(vl)) of pesticides applied in paddy fields for life cycle assessments (WA). The emission quantification methods are based on the properties of the active ingredients of the pesticides and management aspects such as formulations (granular or liquid) and the water-holding period following application. The emission fractions of 37 pesticides used commonly in Japan were estimated using the presented model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by adjusting parameters applied in the model to reveal their influence on the emission fractions. The parameters influencing f(air) included the formulation applied, while the water-holding period and waterproofing of the levee influenced f(sw) regardless of the formulation adopted, suggesting that local management could effectively reduce emissions to surface water. In addition, soil organic carbon content influenced f(vl) greatly, suggesting considerable regional variation in the emission factor. The developed model is expected to greatly improve the realism of impact assessment of pesticide in LCAs for paddy rice cultivation, considering it fills a gap in the fate model used in LCAs to estimate pesticide emissions to air, surface water, and soil in paddy fields.

Since the introduction of crop protection agents (CPAs), it has repeatedly been shown that the method of spray application has an impact on the resulting product effectiveness, yet relatively little systematic progress in achieving the optimum spray deposit has been made. Instead, because of the heterogeneous spatial and temporal nature of most pest complexes, specific optimizations have largely been abandoned in favor of general sprays which compromise spray drift, canopy penetration, retention, and efficacy. New atomization technologies offer opportunities to change droplet size and carrier volume independently, on-the-go. This is expected to renew interest in the optimization of spray quality in a site- or case-specific fashion. Initial implementation of this capability Will revolve around variable rate application and drift management. In the long run, however, there will be a new demand for information relating spray quality to canopy penetration, spray retention, and efficacy for a range of conditions, pests, active ingredients, and formulations. Incorporation of additional information will no doubt increase registration costs and product label complexity.

The required dose of haloxyfop-P-methyl or imazethapyr with adjuvant Adigor (R) in which 95% control of johnsongrass and velvetleaf was obtained (30.42 and 50.69 g active ingredient ha(-1), respectively) were chosen as the optimized doses to compare with their recommended doses (100 and 108 g active ingredient ha(-1), respectively). In general, toxicity of the recommended doses was higher than the optimized doses. In most biological properties of five soybean cultivars, haloxyfop-P-methyl was more toxic than imazethapyr, e.g. shoot dry weight, root nitrogen content, and shoot phosphorus content. But, the intensity of these effects depended on type and concentration of herbicides, and soybean cultivars. In instance, at recommended dose of haloxyfop-P-methyl or imazethapyr as compared with control, the nodule number was reduced up to 71%, 97%, 36%, and 83% in Williams, Sari, Bt Tellar and Inter Price varieties for the former while those were reduced up to 54%, 89%, 70%, and 93% for the latter, respectively.

Many EOs and their major active constituents, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, have shown contact toxicity to postharvest insect pests but their utility is broadened due to their sublethal behavioral effects as deterrents and repellents. These bioactivities result from synergistic effect among particular terpenes, and with the neurotransmitter-mediated toxic action of the terpenes.

The growth and yield of every plant with sexual reproduction, depends on germination and emergence of sown seeds, which is affected greatly by seed disease. This can be most effectively controlled by treating seeds with pesticides before they are sown. An effective seed coating treatment requires a high surface coverage and adhesion of active ingredients onto the seed surface and the addition of adhesive agents in coating formulations plays a key role in achieving this. Although adhesive agents are known to enhance seed germination, little is understood about how they affect surface distribution of actives and how formulations can be manipulated to rationally engineer seed coating preparations with optimized coverage and efficacy. We show, for the first time, that stimulated Raman scattering microscopy can be used to map the seed surface with microscopic spatial resolution and with chemical specificity to identify formulation components distributed on the seed surface.

Such studies are crucial for improving our understanding of the impact of these substances on stream ecology. In this study, we assess the effects of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; the main degradation product of glyphosate) on the photosynthetic rate, dark respiration rate and chlorophyll a content of Nitella microcarpa var. wrightii, a green algae found worldwide. Three concentrations of technical-grade glyphosate and Roundup were tested (0.28, 3.5 and 6 mg l(-1)), while for AMPA only one concentration was evaluated (0.03 mg l(-1)). Our results indicate that glyphosate has a stronger inhibitory effect on photosynthetic rate when applied in association with a surfactant (Roundup). These effects are related both to the concentration of the active ingredient and to exposure time. On the other hand, treatment with AMPA had a stimulatory effect on the photosynthetic rate, which may be associated with an increased supply of phosphorus available to the algae from the AMPA degradation process.

Safeners improve the tolerance of maize to herbicidal active ingredients. In order to investigate the crop response to safener (cyprosulfamide) spray application and seed treatment, greenhouse and field trials were conducted on three maize development stages (2-, 4-, and 6-leaf stage). Visual estimations on crop vitality were compared to ground-based and airborne hyperspectral and multispectral sensors. RESULTS The reduction of cyprosulfamide by 88% when applied as seed treatment did not significantly reduce maize biomass yields at the field. The crop deterioration in both trials was stronger in the cyprosulfamide seed treatments compared to the spray applications but was found to be transient in the field trial. The hyperspectral sensor and multispectral camera data correlated with R-2 = 0.84 (CropSpec Vegetation Index) and R-2 = 0.64 (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). CONCLUSION The sensor-based collection of crop responses to treatments enables early, quantifiable and auditor-independent assessments. In particular, the airborne multispectral imagery assessment of field experiments provides more detailed and comprehensive information than visually collected data. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Potato beetles are capable of developing resistance to various insecticides in relatively few generations. Novel and effective means of controlling Colorado potato beetle populations are constantly required to protect potato crops and prevent loss of yield. The knockdown of gene function through ribonucleic acid interference has been demonstrated in Colorado potato beetles, suggesting the use of this technology as a means of beetle management. A novel double-stranded RNA-based insecticide with the active ingredient, ledprona, has been tested in variable dose laboratory bioassays, followed by field studies. RESULTS Exposure to ledprona resulted in both increased beetle mortality and decreased foliage consumption in all four instars and adult beetles. Effects decreased from earlier to later life stages. No ovicidal activity was detected. Onset of mortality was slower compared with existing chemical insecticides. Nevertheless, field applications of formulated ledprona to potato plots resulted in their protection comparable with that provided by spinosad and chlorantraniliprole.

A total of 121 air samples (personal or area sampling) were collected at 4 factories where chlorpyrifos, EPN, parathion, and phorate, were manufactured/formulated from March through July, 2007-2008. Samples were collected by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) method and were analyzed by GC-MS. The geometric mean (GM) level of airborne chlorpyrifos was 0.17 mg/m(3), 85% Korean Occupational Exposure Limit (KOEL) of 0.2 mg/m(3), and at 95% confidence, airborne concentrations exceeded the KOEL 58.8% of the time or less, indicating that this concentration level was unacceptable according to exposure assessment using a LogNorm2 (R). However, compared with levels of TLV and/or PEL and/or WEL, the GM concentration levels of other OPs were remarkably low (range, 0.1-15.0%) and that these levels of concentrations to the other OPs were acceptable. The levels of airborne concentrations of OPs depended on isolation of the process; in other words, the levels depended on the extent to which the process was automated. The reason that the airborne concentration levels, except for those of chlorpyrifos, were very much lower than expected may be attributable to the fact that there was not exposed to 100% toxic active ingredients in pesticide formulation workplaces because of the use of supplemental agents or additives to produce complete pesticides. This study is limited since there were seldom or neither any data of previous studies to be compared with the study results nor dermal exposure data.

A necessary first step toward managing resistance is to understand insecticide susceptibility profiles in field-collected strains so that active ingredients (AIs) with lowest resistance levels can be identified. As a first step in this study, diagnostic concentrations (DCs) were determined for 14 insecticide AIs based on lethal concentrations that killed 99% or 90% of the individuals from a susceptible lab strain (JWax-S). Next, cockroaches were collected from two low-income multifamily housing complexes in Danville, IL, and Indianapolis, IN, and used to establish laboratory strains. These strains were screened against the 14 AI-DCs in vial bioassays, and susceptibility profiles were determined by comparing percent mortalities between the field strains relative to the JWax-S strain. Results revealed lowest resistance of field strains to boric acid, abamectin, dinotefuran, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and chlorfenapyr. For the AIs hydramethylnon and imidacloprid, field strains did not display survivorship different than the lab strain, but > 90% mortality was never achieved. Lastly, both field strains displayed resistance to indoxacarb, fipronil, acetamiprid, beta-cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin, but at varying levels. These results satisfy two objectives. First, baseline monitoring DCs were established for 14 insecticides presently registered for use against cockroaches, which represents a useful resource.

Furthermore, the combined effect of thymol-carvacrol mixtures and their possible interactions were assessed. Methods: For determining larvicidal and ovicidal 50% lethal concentration (LC50), each monoterpenoid was tested at different concentrations (5-500 mg/L).

But, each component, under current regulations, must be subjected to much the same testing and toxicity standards as potential chemical pesticide active ingredients; this threatens to price pheromone registration beyond economic reason. High species specificity, formulation complexity and low per hectare rates all limit the market viability of a given pheromone: if registration costs are also high the product is dead. Recent proposals to ease the pesticide registration requirements for ''low-risk'' biorational schemes are flawed in that the unequal enforcement provisions are unfair and probably illegal, plus they reinforce the pheromones/pesticide connection.

Herein, scaling based on conservation of energy is utilized to develop a relationship predicting the VDSD for flat fan sprays used in agrochemical application with agrochemical products. To examine the proposed scaling relationship, we made measurements of VDSDs using laser diffraction interferometry for agriculturally relevant tank mixtures, including active pesticides and both emulsion-forming and rheology-modifying drift control adjuvants, sprayed with complex geometry, flat fan nozzles typical of field application.

The adsorption of pretilachlor was entropically driven by hydrophobic interaction. The entropy change dropped with increasing surfactant loading from 0.4 to 1.50 times the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the bentonite used, corresponding to a decrease in the degree of freedom of pretilachlor molecules due to the enhanced order of surfactant in the interlayer. The kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption was well fitted to the pseudo-second-order model and related to the structural features of organobentonites. The enhanced packing density of the surfactant in the interlayer generally resulted in a reduction of the rate constant of the pretilachlor adsorption onto organobentonites. However, the stepwise increase in the basal spacing due to the surfactant arrangement transition, from lateral-monolayer to lateral-bilayer at a loading level of more than 0.8 x CEC, benefited the diffusion of pretilachlor and diminished the influence of the increase in surfactant packing density. The release of pretilachlor from organobentonites was predominated by Fickian diffusion, which could be understood from the adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics. The time taken for the release of 50% of active ingredient was 16-23 times that for the control formulation and exhibited a linear increase with the relative value of the equilibrium constant to the rate constant of pretilachlor adsorption.",2020,5,4191,4199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b04025

Efficacy and technical viability of the process to obtain rolliniastatin-1 from the seeds of A. mucosa should allow the production of a botanical insecticide to control populations of S. zeamais at corn warehouses.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the lethal and sublethal effects via residual contact of commercial pesticide formulations on D. longicaudata. The active ingredients thiamethoxam, indoxacarb, chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, spinetoram, spinosad, phosmet, lambda-cyhalothrin, malathion, dimethoate, and methidationa showed high toxicity to adults (100% mortality) after 96 h and were classified as harmful (Class 4). In contrast, the formulations of azadirachtin (Agroneem 850 EC, Azact 2.4 EC, Azamax 12 EC, and Fitoneem 850 EC), chlorantraniliprole, bordeaux mixture, sulfur, lufenuron, lime sulphur, novalurom, and mancozeb were rated as innocuous (<10% mortality). In addition, the formulations azadirachtin did not reduce the parasitism and the emergence rate of the F-0 generation, the same pesticides added to chlorantraniliprole, azadirachtin A+B (Agroneem 850 EC), and lufenuron did not cause reduction in parasitism and emergence rate of the F-1 generation of D. longicaudata.

The species identified using molecular and morphological techniques indicated that from 25 samples the pathogens were Fusarium oxysporum (three formae speciales - melonis, lima, and gladioli). Fusarium symptoms developed in both trials and the not-treated checks had reduced emergence about 30 days after planting (DAP). In the trials where fungicides and biofungicides were applied to corms only the symptoms were drastically reduced in comparison to the trials where fungicides were sprayed as post-emergence treatments. Fusarium continued to develop throughout the seasons in both years and plant stand decreased with time in some treatments. Continued Fusarium development was measured by evaluating the incidence of plants with visible stem base necrosis at least up to 1.5 cm above the soil line. Several treatments applied as corm dips were significantly different in their efficacy from the non-inoculated not-treated check. Treatments with less than 25.0% lodging had significantly fewer lodged plants in comparison to the not-treated inoculated check. Treatments with more than 75.0% of stems with inflorescences had significantly greater flowering rate than the not-treated inoculated check (53.6%). The reduction in emergence, height and flowering rate may have been indicative of a physiological effect of the products applied. Treatments applied as foliar sprays were ineffective in reducing the impact of corm-borne Fusarium.

Such studies are important for the conduct of risk assessments to protect wildlife and the environment, but they should only be conducted when their use is scientifically justified. One test of questionable scientific merit is the chronic fish toxicity test when conducted with formulated PPPs, which is a potential requirement under European legislation: chronic exposure to the formulated product per se rarely occurs in the environment and therefore it is generally not possible to use the data from chronic formulation studies in a meaningful risk assessment. A recent survey of European crop protection companies to explore the scientific merits and regulatory drivers for chronic fish toxicity studies has shown that current practice in deciding on the need for chronic fish toxicity testing of formulated PPPs varies substantially between companies. The most commonly cited reason for conducting such studies was solely to meet regulatory requirements. We conclude that chronic formulation testing is rarely if ever scientifically justified, and recommend that the forthcoming revision of the EU Aquatic Toxicology Guidance Document takes account of this by including a requirement that justification must be provided for conducting the test, rather than the current situation where the onus is on the registrant to provide a justification for not conducting the test.

The strain Streptomyces carpaticus RCAM04697 was isolated from saline soils in the arid zone. The qualitative and quantitative composition of low molecular weight organic compounds (LMWOCs) in suspension and extracts of this strain (hexanic, water-alcoholic (50/50), methanolic), which has antiviral, insectoacaricidal, fungicidal, and phytostimulating properties, was studied by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using a gas chromatography - mass spectrometer SHIMADZU GCMS-QP2010 Ultra. Mass spectra were recorded in the scanning mode for the full mass range (30-1090 m/z) in the programmed temperature mode. The detected LMWOCs were identified using the mass spectrum libraries NIST-2014 and Wiley. GC/MS-analysis of metabolites of the strain showed that the identified LMWOCs have valuable properties from an agricultural point of view: bactericidal (2-methylpentane-2,4-diol); fungicidal (2-methylpentane-2,4-diol); insecticidal (propan-2-yl tetradecanoate). Dodecan-1-ol is a part of pheromones, sexual attractants, and surfactants for pest control. GC/MS analysis showed that the hexane extract of the strain S. carpaticus RCAM04697 had the largest number of metabolites 13 LMWOCs, whereas the methanol extract contained only 3 LMWOCs. It should be noted that the identified metabolites confirm our earlier information that the suspension and extracts (hexanic, water-alcoholic (50/50), methanolic) of S. carpaticus RCAM04697 strain can be used as a basis for creating biological plant protection products with high biological effectiveness with insecticidal, acaricidal, fungicidal, bactericidal properties. Streptomycetes are an inexhaustible source of new biologically active substances that can be used in plant protection, agronomy, medicine, and veterinary medicine. Thus, we consider it necessary to continue research in the field of studying the properties of actinomycete metabolites, in particular, streptomycetes, due to the need to decipher the ecological and biochemical mechanisms of their existence, characterized by the great potential in various industries, and especially in the field of environmental agrotechnologies.",2021,NA,172,178,http://dx.doi.org/10.25750/1995-4301-2021-3-172-178

Critical problems include the scope of regulatory testing protocols, the near-total focus on pure active ingredients rather than formulated products, lack of publicly accessible information on co-formulants, excessive reliance on industry-supported studies coupled with reticence to incorporate published results in the risk assessment process, and failure to take advantage of new scientific opportunities and advances, e.g. biomonitoring and omics technologies. Recommended Actions: Problems in pesticide risk assessment are identified and linked to study design, data, and methodological shortcomings. Steps and strategies are presented that have potential to deepen scientific knowledge of pesticide toxicity, exposures, and risks. We propose four solutions: (1) End near-sole reliance in regulatory decision-making on industry-supported studies by supporting and relying more heavily on independent science, especially for core toxicology studies. The cost of conducting core toxicology studies at labs not affiliated with or funded directly by pesticide registrants should be covered via fees paid by manufacturers to public agencies. (2) Regulators should place more weight on mechanistic data and low-dose studies within the range of contemporary exposures. (3) Regulators, public health agencies, and funders should increase the share of exposure-assessment resources that produce direct measures of concentrations in bodily fluids and tissues. Human biomonitoring is vital in order to quickly identify rising exposures among vulnerable populations including applicators, pregnant women, and children. (4) Scientific tools across disciplines can accelerate progress in risk assessments if integrated more effectively. New genetic and metabolomic markers of adverse health impacts and heritable epigenetic impacts are emerging and should be included more routinely in risk assessment to effectively prevent disease. Conclusions: Preventing adverse public health outcomes triggered or made worse by exposure to pesticides will require changes in policy and risk assessment procedures, more science free of industry influence, and innovative strategies that blend traditional methods with new tools and mechanistic insights.",2021,20,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-021-00773-4

Effective adjuvants are distinguished as donor adjuvants, that produce a liquid film on the surface, and accelerator adjuvants, that additionally can penetrate into and increase solute mobility in the cuticle. Adjuvant efficacy in both groups differs significantly among products and is characterized according to chemistry and concentration, technical product quality, environmental factors, and plant organ (leaf/fruit) and species, respectively.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacy of different silica products against two stored insect pests, the granary weevil, Sitophilus granarius (L.), and the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.), under different environmental conditions. Different AL-06-formulations (developed at Humboldt University) were compared with commercial DE products Fossil Shield (R) (FS100, FS90.0s and FS80p) and three synthetic amorphous silica formulations (SAK). The experiments were conducted in Petri dishes with and without food under different climate conditions. Mortality and mass of the beetles were recorded over time. The mortality rate was determined after 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 d. The highest S. granarius mortality, with 92% after 48h, was achieved with a commercially available SAK. This study indicates that SAK can effectively control S. granarius. The hydrophilic DE FS100 and another SAK failed to control the beetles effectively. Beetle mortality rate increased with dosages of all materials. Feeding material increased survival time significantly, most likely because beetles were able to metabolize water from the food. Four of the DE products decreased the beetle population within 14 d to less than 50% and within 28 d to 15%, respectively. The poor performance of some formulations was due to the loss of insecticidal efficacy as a consequence of water saturation of these hydrophilic substances when held in higher humidity. The application products consisting of smaller particles resulted in generally higher mortality rates than the use of DEs with larger particles. Further studies are planned to identify water saturation effects.",2010,858,311,318,NA

Water was used as control for the in vitro assay, whereas under greenhouse conditions, controls were inoculated and not inoculated with M. javanica. The tests were conducted in a completely randomized design with six ( in vitro) and ten (greenhouse) replicates.

Next to a high quality product also a limited residue loading on the fruit surface is requested. Particularly the number of active ingredients on the fruit surface is restricted, and also some standard applied plant protection products (PPPs) are prohibited. The chemical fungicides applied shortly before harvest towards fruit rot decay during storage are frequently detected after analytical analysis. Therefore, these chemicals are, at the moment, in the focus of interest of the industry. To this end, research concerning alternative approaches has exploded in the past years. The European government is also stimulating this kind of research indirectly as each member state is demanded to adopt a national action plan to reduce risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment (Directive 2009/128/EC). In collaboration with the plant protection industry research was done to investigate non-chemical alternatives for postharvest disease control. Several yeast strains were selected and formulated to verify their potential as a biological control agent (BCA). In order to enhance the efficacy, the supplementary effect of natural products and physical treatments is also implemented in this study. As for the application technique in general, a postharvest treatment by dipping, which is a more standardized application where all parameters can be quantified and controlled, is selected. In addition to the fruit surface, also wounds, caused by picking and transport, will be covered resulting in a higher biological efficacy towards key wound pathogens as Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium spp. Depending on the type of BCA some promising results were obtained.

Glyphosate may be used alone, but it is commonly applied as an active ingredient of the herbicide Roundup (R). This pesticide contains several adjuvants, which may promote an unknown toxicity. The indiscriminate application poses numerous problems, both for the health of the applicators and consumers, and for the environment, contaminating the soil, water and leading to the death of plants and animals. Zebrafish (Danio redo) is quickly gaining popularity in behavioral research, because of physiological similarity to mammals, sensitivity to pharmacological factors, robust performance, low cost, short spawning intervals, external fertilization, transparency of embryos through larval stages, and rapid development. The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of glyphosate and Roundup on behavioral and morphological parameters in zebrafish larvae and adults. Zebrafish larvae at 3 days post-fertilization and adults were exposed to glyphosate (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) or Roundup (0.01, 0.065, and 0.5 mg/L) for 96 h. Immediately after the exposure, we performed the analysis of locomotor activity, aversive behavior, and morphology for the larvae and exploratory behavior, aggression and inhibitory avoidance memory for adult zebrafish. In zebrafish larvae, there were significant differences in the locomotor activity and aversive behavior after glyphosate or Roundup' exposure when compared to the control group. Our findings demonstrated that exposure to glyphosate at the concentration of 0.5 mg/L, Roundup at 0.065 or 0.5 mg/L reduced the distance traveled, the mean speed and the line crossings in adult zebrafish. A decreased ocular distance was observed for larvae exposed at 0.5 mg/L of glyphosate. We verified that at 0.5 mg/L of Roundup-treated adult zebrafish demonstrated a significant impairment in memory. Both glyphosate and Roundup (R) reduced aggressive behavior. Our data suggest that there are small differences between the effects induced by glyphosate and Roundup', altering morphological and behavioral parameters in zebrafish, suggesting common mechanisms of toxicity and cellular response.",2017,392,32,39,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2017.10.007

In this study, feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb (residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides (classes) did not influence on adult survivorship, but all treatments caused significantly lower body weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body weight loss, and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + lambda-cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase (EST) activity, while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. However, ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19%.

In addition to mortality, ingestion of clothianidin at LC50 significantly reduced bee body weight by 12%. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees, while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus, data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees.

Disruption of both C. pomonella and G. molesta male orientation to pheromone traps in plots treated with a dual-species formulation (Isomate CM/OFM TT), simultaneously releasing the pheromone components of both C. pomonella and G. molesta, was equivalent to that obtained by treating plots with separate formulations for each species (Isomate C Plus or Isomate C TT for C. pomonella and Isomate M Rosso for G. molesta) through mid-season. However, disruption efficacy of the dual-species formulation was significantly lower near the and of the season for G. molesta compared with the Isomate M Rosso formulation because of depletion of active ingredients and coincided with a slight increase in fruit injury. Effective disruption of C. pomonella and G. molesta also was obtained with a multispecies formulation (Isomate CM/OFM/LR) that releases the main pheromone components of C. pomonella, G. molesta, and several leafroller species. Each formulation type releasing (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-of (codlemone) also was found to release the E,Z- and Z,E-isomers of codlemone. Our data provide further evidence that simultaneous disruption of C. pomonella and G. molesta with dispensers releasing both species' pheromone components is possible; however, the controlled release formulations tested here require modification or postponed deployment coupled with early season control by other means to achieve season-long efficacy.

Two SC and one WG formulation of imidacloprid (Confidor(R)) were tested in 11 trials near Bundaberg or Childers in southern Queensland. These defined useful application rates for the formulations, compared the efficacy of formulations, tested surface and subsurface placement, tested different spacings of the coulters behind which the insecticide was applied, and compared the efficacy of early and late applications of the insecticide. Comparisons were made with cadusafos (Rugby(R) 100 G). Kill of larvae was not as rapid or great as following treatment with cadusafos, but surviving larvae appeared not to be feeding as much. Both SC formulations at rates of at least 3.75 g active ingredient/100 m of row applied into the soil behind coulters placed either side of the stool gave similar gains in cane yield to applications of cadusafos. The WG formulation showed some responses, but was not tested extensively. Application to the soil surface was not as effective as injection into the soil behind coulters. Efficacy seemed to be largely unaffected by the spacing between the coulters. Early applications appear to be more effective than later applications, and lead to larger yield responses. Imidacloprid provides a way of treating infested ratoon crops, does not degrade in high-pH soils, and can be used in rotation with the organophosphate-based cadusafos and chlorpyrifos (suSCon(R) Blue) to minimise the development of insecticide resistance.

However, the overuse of pesticides can harm non-target organisms, and, thus, it is vital to comprehensively study their effects on the different metabolic pathways of living organisms. In the present study, enzyme-inhibition-based assays have been used to investigate the effects of commercial pesticide formulations on the key enzymes of the organisms, which catalyze a wide variety of metabolic reactions (protein catabolism, lactic acid fermentation, alcohol metabolism, the conduction of nerve impulses, etc.). Assay conditions have been optimized, and the limitations of the methods used in the study, which are related to the choice of the solvent for commercial pesticide formulations and optical effects occurring when commercial pesticide formulations are mixed with solutions of enzymes and substrates of assay systems, have been revealed. The effects of commercial pesticide formulations on simple chemoenzymatic assay systems (single-enzyme reactions) have been compared to their effects on complex multicomponent molecular systems (multi-enzyme reactions) and organisms (luminescent bacterium). The in vitro assay systems have shown higher sensitivity to pesticide exposure than the in vivo assay system. The sensitivity of the in vitro assay systems increases with the elongation of the chain of conjugated chemoenzymatic reactions. The effects exerted by commercial pesticide formulations with the same active ingredient but produced by different manufacturers on assay system functions have been found to differ from each other.",2022,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/chemosensors10080328

These radicals react with organic pollutants and thus lead to their degradation. Each pesticide contains many active ingredients and additives. The treated solutions were followed by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurement during the processing permitted the evaluation of the kinetic of organic matter decay and the mineralization efficiency.

Effects of the microchannel structure, reaction temperature, surfactant type, and fluid flow rates were investigated and evaluated. The results showed that pendimethalin microcapsules prepared under suitable conditions had a smooth surface, good monodispersity, a high encapsulation efficiency (96.7%), and excellent thermal stability. The size and morphology control of microcapsules were realized by adjusting the flow rates of the continuous phase and the hydrophilic monomer EDA aqueous solution. The release of pendimethalin had a sustained release characteristic that was closely related to the morphology of microcapsules.

Twenty-four hours after the last injection, the uterus was removed and weighed and processed for histopathology and mRNA extraction. Epithelial cell proliferation and height and expression of estrogen-responsive genes were evaluated (estrogen receptors, ER and ER; progesterone receptor, PR; complement 3, C3). Uterine weight and epithelial proliferation were not affected by GBH. However, the luminal epithelial cell height increased at GBH0.5. ER mRNA was downregulated by all GBH doses and E-2 groups, whereas PR and C3 mRNA were diminished by GBH0.5. GBH5-, GBH50-, and UE2-treated rats showed downregulated ER protein expression in luminal epithelial cells, while the receptor was upregulated in the stroma. GBH upregulated ER (GBH0.5-50) and PR (GBH5) expressions in glandular epithelial cells, similar effect to that of NUE2 group.

In the process of microencapsulation with various emulsifying agents under the condition of high to medium concentration, polysulfonated emulsifiers such as lignosulfonate and styrenesulfonate sometimes failed to produce microcapsules because of random solidification of the aqueous mass leaving a serious problem of reproducibility. A protective colloid, polyvinylalcohol (PVA), was examined to prepare the stable high-concentrated emulsion under various conditions. Capsule slurry with 33% active ingredient was successfully obtained by the use of ca. 1% PVA as a protective colloid. In the case of the capsule with 42% active ingredient, the wall-forming reaction produced microcapsules, which turned out to be considerably coagulated or sometimes resulted in the failure of producing microcapsules. However, it was found that the mixed emulsifier of 10% of PVA and 90% of poly (sodium4-styrenesulfonate (PSS) produced stable emulsion and successfully led to microcapsules in high concentration under various conditions without any problems of reproducibility.

In addition, samples for measuring a possible background value were taken upwind of the sprayed field. Deposits of spray drift were common to all spray equipment and spray was detected up to 150 m off-target. There were deposits of 0.1-9% of the applied amount close to the sprayed field (up to 2 m). But 3 m from the spraying zone deposits were reduced to 0.02-4%. The amounts decreased exponentially when moving away from the field. The differences in drift could be described mainly by the different drop sizes, the wind velocity, the formulation and the filtering effect of vegetation on the sampling area. The tendency of the active ingredients to evaporate could also have an, although less important, influence on the drift. This is a factor, which ought to be exposed to a further study. The findings supported that it is the physical properties of the spray and the conditions of application (i.e. equipment and meteorology) that are the primary determinants of primary drift rather than the chemical property of the pure active ingredients.

After 7 days of cultivation in the nutrient solution determined were the growth parameters and some biochemical compounds (photosynthetic pigments, total protein and free amino compounds content). The combined action of 1 nmol.dm(-3) rimsulfuron and salt caused a reduction in plant biomass accumulation, but this reduction was due to the salt itself. In the presence of 100 nmol.dm(-3) rimsulfuron, growth inhibition of maize roots was very high and salinity did not modify herbicide toxicity. However, reduction in maize shoots growth equalled the sum of the reductions caused by each particular factor applied separately (additive effect). The reduction in shoot fresh weight reached 64%. The investigated stress factors induced a significant increase in amino compounds, with the exception of maize roots gown under NaCl plus 100 nmol.dm(-3) rimsulfuron. The concentration of total protein in maize roots diminished under NaCl and 100 nmol.dm(-3) rimsulfuron, although in the other cases, it did not change distinctly in comparison to the control.

Formulated Emulsfiable concentrate (E.C.). Toxaphene (60% Chlorinated camphene) was used in four successive sprays during the cotton season on an area of 1.5 million acres at the rate of 2L/acre during the first three seasons(1956-1958). The rate was then increased to 3L/acre during the next two seasons (1959-1960). In the 1961 season, a disaster occurred when toxaphene even at 4L/acre failed to stop the infestation outbreak of the cotton leaf worm resulting in a loss of 50% of the national cotton yield of that season. This failure was caused by the build up of cotton leaf worm resistance to toxaphene. The total amount of toxaphene used during these six seasons was estimated to be 54,000 metric tons of the active ingredient. Although the use of Toxaphene in Egypt was banned in 1962 due to the irreversible cotton leaf worm resistance, new sources of toxaphene residues kept comming to Egypt across the River Nile Basin countries which were still heavily using toxaphene (Sudan, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Congo). As well, the illegal use of toxaphene by fishermen was another source of toxaphene pollution. The residues of toxaphene seem to be quite persistent as shown by the few studies carried out. Levels up to 10 ppm were detected in the River Nile water, soil and other biological samples in the Egyptian environment. (Saleh, 1981).

Foliage was also fed to laboratory-reared 4th- and 6th-instar spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens). The data indicated that tebufenozide residues in foliage declined with time according to first-order kinetics. The average rate-constant and half-life of disappearance (DT50) were 0.0340 and 20.45 days, respectively. Larval mortality declined gradually, corresponding to the residues, but was still appreciable (49 to 70%) when the larvae were fed with foliage collected 64 days after treatment. The amount of foliage consumed by the larvae decreased when foliar residues of tebufenozide increased, thus indicating anti-feedant activity of the chemical.

We tested sorption of PM on montmorillonite and on two different organo-montmorillonites in a mixed water-chloroform environment, to determine the feasibility of developing an environmentally oriented formulation of the herbicide. FTIR measurements show that the interactions of PM with montmorillonite on which difenzoquat (DZ) or mepiquat (MQ) were, previously adsorbed are via the nitro and methyl groups of the herbicide. The pre-adsorbed organocations cause a dehydration of the interlayer space, leading to hydrophobicity of the organoclay. Changes in the electrokinetic surface charge of the organoclay measured using a particle charge detector, confirm these results. The high affinity to PM and the hydrophobic behavior of the used organoclays were also demonstrated in experiments using a mixed chloroform-water environment. The crude clay mineral stayed in the water phase. whereas DZ- and MQ-montmorillonites concentrated in the PM-chloroform phase. Amounts of PM adsorbed to the organoclays using this method were very high (up to 0.65 mol PM kg(-1) compound), which suggests a very efficient technology of preparation of herbicide-clay formulations, compared with techniques used in the past for similar herbicide-organoclay compounds. Plant experiments using die organoclay-herbicide formulation with higher amount of active ingredient (based on DZ-clay) demonstrate efficient herbicidal activity with 30% less active ingredient.

The majority (>90%) of the spray deposit from a famoxadone 500g kg(-1) water-dispersible granule formation on a grape leaf were found on the leaf surface or associated with epicuticular waxes. A significant fi action of this deposit could not be removed by a water wash, suggesting strong binding to the waxes. Nearly 100% of the spray deposit was still recovered after 12 days of exposure to a dry environment, confirming the good residual properties of the substance. Thirty per cent of the applied active ingredient was lost after exposure to a wet environment, probably via hydrolysis or wash-off. Studies with radiolabelled famoxadone formulated as a suspension concentrate indicated that redistribution occurred both in dry conditions, via diffusion in the cuticular waxes, and in wet conditions via dissolution in water followed by re-deposition. No systemic movement of famoxadone was observed within the treated plant. Grape plants treated with famoxadone alone or in mixture with cymoxanil and subjected to up to 50mm of artificial rain remained well protected against downy mildew infections. Good rain-fastness was observed even 2h after fungicide application.

Serious shortcomings have occurred in the search for new active ingredients, such as the initial selection of fenoxycarb, copper oxychloride and diflubenzuron, compounds considered very promising but whose inefficiency was verified only later, indicating methodological problems. In view of this situation, we developed a classification method for insecticidal activity over time using workers of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens rubropilosa Forel. The insecticides used were fipronil, sulfluramid GX071HB and sulfluramid GX439, vehicled in an attractive pasty formulation prepared based on citrus pulp. The results obtained were consistent from a toxicological viewpoint and agreed with the literature in terms of the control of colonies. Sulfluramids were found to possess a delayed action at a broad range of concentrations, in agreement with the fact that these substances are highly effective in the control of all leaf-cutting ant species. The smaller range of concentrations of fipronil with delayed action is probably related to its lower efficacy for species more difficult to control such as Atta capiguara (Forti et at. 2003).

Increasing use of pesticides by smallholder farmers is suspected to have negative effects on non-target organisms. In this study, possible pesticide impact on the development of tadpoles was investigated. Two insecticide formulations used in cotton cultivation in Benin were compared: CotofanA (R) (active ingredient (a.i.): alpha- and beta-endosulfan) and TihanA (R) (a.i.: spirotetramat and flubendiamide). Tadpoles of the widespread species Amietophrynus maculatus were kept in small water basins with increasing insecticide concentrations (1, 10 and 100 mu g a.i./L) over a period of 28 days. Tadpoles showed reduced survival at the highest endosulfan concentrations (100 mu g/L). Survival of tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis was not influenced by TihanA (R). Endosulfan in concentrations of 10 and 100 mu g/L negatively impacted the movement of the tadpoles which was not the case for the mixture of spirotetramat and flubendiamide. Time to metamorphosis was not significantly different in the various treatments. Tail length of tadpoles was significantly shorter in CotofanA (R) treatments compared to controls. Pesticide residues in the tadpoles were relatively low after keeping them in concentrations of 1 and 10 mu g a.i./L (25 and 26 mu g/kg wet weight (w/w) for the sum of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate and below the detection limits for flubendiamide and spirotetramat). For the 100 mu g a.i./L treatments, 1,600 mu g/kg w/w was found of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate together in the survived tadpoles and 21 mu g/kg w/w of flubendiamide.",2015,22,2574,2583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3462-y

Ammonia also contributed to toxicity in one sample, an unidentified OP was responsible far toxicity in another sample, and unidentified transient toxicant(s) were present in four samples. Transient toxicity was not due to surfactants (methylene blue active substances, cobalt thiocyanate active substances, or nonyl- or octylphenolethoxylates) or to a polymer used to dewater the sludge.

It has been found to cause nasal, stomach, and thyroid tumours in rodent feeding studies at levels that are much higher than likely human exposures. Aims: To evaluate mortality rates from 1968 to 1999 and cancer incidence rates from 1969 to 1999 for alachlor manufacturing workers at a plant in Muscatine, Iowa. Methods: Worker mortality and cancer incidence rates were compared to corresponding rates for the Iowa state general population. Analyses addressed potential intensity and duration of exposure. Results: For workers with any period of high alachlor exposure, mortality from all causes combined was lower than expected (42 observed deaths, SMR 64, 95% CI 46 to 86) and cancer mortality was slightly lower than expected (13 observed deaths, SMR 79, 95% CI 42 to 136). Cancer incidence for workers with potential high exposure was similar to that for Iowa residents, both overall (29 observed cases, SIR 123, 95% CI 82 to 177) and for workers exposed for five or more years and with at least 15 years since first exposure (eight observed cases, SIR 113, 95% CI 49 to 224). There were no cases of nasal, stomach, or thyroid cancer. Conclusions: There were no cancers of the types found in toxicology studies and no discernible relation between cancer incidence for any site and years of alachlor exposure or time since first exposure. Despite the small size of this population, the findings are important because these workers had chronic exposure potential during extended manufacturing campaigns, while use in agriculture is typically limited to a few days or weeks each year.",2004,61,680,685,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/oem.2003.010934

Antifeedant activity to the strawberry aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii (Cockerell), for example, was lost within 24 hours following applications to strawberry in the greenhouse. Control instead results from the inhibition of adult reproduction and from the failure of nymphs to molt. Efficacy is variable, however, depending on the species of aphid, instar, and host plant. Populations of predacious and parasitic insects were not adversely affected by sprays of NSO or neem seed extract (NSE) in the field, but, based on laboratory trials, natural enemies of aphids are moderately susceptible to the insect growth regulating effects of neem.

Firstly, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), and lipid-based nanoemulsions (NE) with similar characteristics (particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential) were successfully prepared by the combined method of hot homogenization and sonication, with beeswax as a solid lipid, corn oil as a liquid lipid, and Nile Red as a fluorescent active-ingredient. Penetration of nanocarriers into the roots and their transportation to the stem were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The images of vertical sections illustrated that NE penetrated into the root and was transported upward at a rate faster than did NLC and SLN, because of its relatively higher flexibility. While it took only 1 day for NE to penetrate into the center of the root and be transported upward to up to 4 cm of the stem, it took 3 and 6 days, respectively, for NLC and SLN to achieve the same. This study provides an important basic background required to generate a new generation of pesticide formulations, where pesticides will be encapsulated in nanocarriers, which in turn will be embedded into a patch that will be stuck on the root or stem. This would minimize pesticide loss, resulting in higher commercial profit and better environmental protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since glyphosate is highly water soluble it reaches water bodies easily in surface water runoff. This prompted us to undertake an experiment to evaluate the effects of glyphosate in Roundup(R) on natural communities of marine microphytobenthos. Microphytobenthos communities were obtained from the environment, and after transporting them to the laboratory and acclimatizing them, they were tested under controlled conditions. Changes in microphytobenthos composition and structure and the deteriorating condition of the cells of community-forming organisms (assessed by analyzing changes in chloroplast shape) were used to assess the impact of Roundup(R) on endpoints. The tests indicated that microphytobenthic communities were relatively resistant to herbicide. The species richness of the communities probably enabled them to rebuild effectively. Sensitive species were replaced by those more tolerant of glyphosate. Only at the highest glyphosate concentration (8.5 g center dot dm(-3)) tested was a strong negative effect noted that limited community abundance and eliminated some of the organisms. The dominant diatoms in the communities were replaced by intensively developing cyanobacteria, which ultimately comprised nearly 60% of all the cells observed in the communities.",2021,18,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18030884

Autodissemination, using conspecific species to transfer pesticide, is unable to provide proactive control. Here we report results from a new hypothesis, heterodissemination, wherein females of the cohabiting non-biting midge, Chironomus decorus, reared in the laboratory, treated with pyriproxyfen, and released to transfer lethal concentrations to shared mosquito larval habitats. Results Pyriproxyfen-impregnated oil and powder formulations were developed. The average payload for each female midge treated with oil followed by powder formulations was 5.07 +/- 0.92 mu g of active ingredient or 1660 times the median lethal concentration (LC50) for Ae. albopictus or Ae. aegypti in 200 mL of water. Subsequent residue analysis showed pyriproxyfen transference from chironomids, treated with oil formulation only, into water-holding containers up to 2.06 ppb or 171.7 times the LC50. Releasing 20 laboratory reared and contaminated Chironomus decorus into a small room resulted in 80.42 +/- 0.67% and 75.67 +/- 3.14% Ae. albopictus pupal mortality in open and cryptic sentinel ovicups, respectively. Container water volumes ranging up to 4 L did not affect efficacy. In a large field cage, 90.3 +/- 2.5% Ae. albopictus mortality was resulted from releasing 100 treated female midges. Releasing 400 contaminated midges into a residential backyard resulted in 74.3% pupal mortality in sentinel ovicups. Conclusions Room, large field cage and field release trials demonstrated that adult midges reared and treated in the laboratory transfer highly lethal concentrations of pyriproxyfen to Ae. albopictus container habitats. Heterodissemination provides a potential approach for precision, proactive mosquito control, which may draw attention for further studies.

However, natural systems are complex and biological communities diverse. The organophosphate pesticide propetamphos (PPT) has been found exceeding regulatory limits (100 ng L-1) in rivers. We address whether solution properties affect the fate of Analar (Analar-PPT) or industrial PPT (PPT-Ind) propetamphos formulations and whether propetamphos and metal toxicant effects are additive, antagonistic or synergistic? The sorption, desorption, biodegradation and microbial toxicology of Analar-PPT and PPT-Ind were investigated in Conwy River and estuary sediment. Results showed elevated salinity enhanced PPT sorption, while higher salinities increased PPT-Ind retention. Higher dissolved organic matter (DOM) and low salinity slowed Analar-PVT biodegradation (1.9 x 10(-3) h(-1)). Analar-PPT and PPT-Ind biodegradation was further reduced by low salinity, high DOM and dissolved Zn and Pb (6.3 x 10(-4) h(-1), 1100 h t(1/2) for Analar-PPT; 7.5 x 10(-4) h(-1), 924 h t(1/2) for PPT-Ind). Toxicity effects of PPT, Zn and Pb in equitoxic ratio were higher for PPT-Ind (4.7 mu g PPT-Ind g(-1); 581 mu g Zn g(-1); 395 mu g Pb g(-1)) than for Analar-PPT (34.6 mu g PPT g(-1); 312 mu g Zn g(-1); 212 mu g Pb g(-1)) whilst a toxicant ratio 1:100:10 suggested small quantities of Analar-PPT (EC10 = 0.06 mu g g(-1)) affected microbial communities.

In distilled water and in PEG-containing solutions displaying -0.1 MPa potential and up, the beads imbibe water and swell. The ensuing increase in weight is about 5%, and the increase in the bead's diameter is about 10%. At water potentials of -0.5 MPa and lower, loss of weight and shrinkage of the beads were observed. The changes in weight and diameter of the alginate-clay beads incubated in a Hamra loamy sand soil at 26.5% moisture content (w/w; -0.18 MPa) were similar to those observed in PEG solutions of > -0.5 MPa moisture potential. The weight and diameter losses observed in the drier soils (12.0 and 7.1% water content; -0.49 and -1.11 MPa) were similar to those in the more concentrated PEG solutions. A decrease in the rate of release of the active ingredient from the beads into soil was observed as the water potential decreased (drier soils).

Nanoencapsulation can enhance the pest-control efficiency over extended durations by preventing the premature degradation of active ingredients (AIs) under harsh environmental conditions. This review is thus organized to critically assess the significant role of nanotechnology for encapsulation of AIs for pesticides. The smart delivery of pesticides is essential to reduce the dosage of AIs with enhanced efficacy and to overcome pesticide loss (e.g., due to leaching and evaporation). The future trends of pesticide nanoformulations including nanomaterials as AIs and nanoemulsions of biopesticides are also explored.

We investigated separately the effects of iminoctadine, POEAE, and BFR on heart rate and blood pressure of rats and also on isolated atria and aortas. In isolated rat atria, iminoctadine produced positive chronotropic and inotropic responses. In contrast, POEAE produced negative chronotropic and inotropic responses. BFR produced no effects at low concentrations, but significant negative chronotropic and inotropic responses at high concentrations. In isolated rat aortas, iminoctadine produced remarkable vasodilative responses, but POEAE produced vasoconstrictive responses. BFR produced both vasodilative and vasoconstrictive responses. When intravenously administered to anesthetized rats, iminoctadine produced hypotension and tachycardia in a dose-dependent manner. POEAE produced significant hypotension and slight bradycardia. BFR, at low doses, produced hypotension without elevation of heart rate. At high doses, it produced significant hypotension and tachycardia. From these results, it can be concluded that severe hypotension induced by BFR is due mainly to the vasodilative effect of iminoctadine and partly to the cardio-suppressive effect of POEAE.

To combat increased patterns of resistance to chemicals against mosquito vectors, alternative candidate insecticide formulations should be screened. With mortality as the primary endpoint, the persistence of residual efficacy of a polymer-enhanced pyrethroid suspension concentrate containing deltamethrin (K-Othrine (R) PolyZone-KOPZ) applied at 25 mg active ingredient (ai)/m(2) was compared with a microencapsulated organophosphate suspension formulation of pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic (R) 300CS-ACS) applied at 1 g ai/m(2). Methods Following standard spray application, periodic contact bioassays were conducted for at least 38 weeks on four types of wall surfaces (unbaked clay, baked clay, cement, and painted cement) sprayed with either KOPZ or ACS in simulated semi-field conditions. Similarly, two types of existing walls in occupied houses (painted cement and baked clay) were sprayed and examined. A colonized strain of female Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes were exposed to treated or untreated surfaces (controls) for 30 min. For each wall surface test period, 40 treatment mosquitoes (4 cones x 10) in semi-field and 90 (9 cones x 10) in 'natural' house conditions were used per wall. 30 mosquitoes (3 cones x 10) on a matching unsprayed surface served as the control. Insecticide, wall material, and sprayed location on wall (in houses) were compared by final mortality at 24 h. Results Insecticide, wall material, and sprayed location on wall surface produced significant difference for mean final mortality over time. In semi-field conditions, KOPZ produced a 72% mean mortality over a 38-week period, while ACS gave 65% (p < 0.001). Painted cement wall performed better than other wall surfaces throughout the study period (73% mean mortality). In the two occupied houses, KOPZ provided a mean mortality of 88%, significantly higher than ACS (p < 0.001). KOPZ provided an effective residual life (>= 80% mortality) between 7.3 and 14 weeks on experimental walls and between 18.3 and 47.2 weeks in houses, while ACS persisted between 3 and 7.6 weeks under semi-field conditions and between 7.1 and 17.3 weeks in houses. Household painted cement walls provided a longer effective residual activity compared to baked clay for both formulations. Greater mortality was recorded at the top and middle sections of sprayed wall compared to the bottom portion near the floor. Conclusion KOPZ provided longer residual activity on all surfaces compared to ACS. Painted cement walls provided better residual longevity for both insecticides compared to other surfaces. Insecticides also performed better in an occupied house environment compared to semi-field constructed walls.

When trying to assess the volatilisation potential of a given pesticide (i. e., its volatility) based on volatilisation measurements one is faced with a number of uncertainties. All volatilisation measurements are influenced by a number of parameters which depend on the experimental design. While the qualitative nature of the influence often is understood the effects usually cannot be quantified. When assessing pesticide volatility based on the physicochemical properties of the active ingredient other uncertainties need to be addressed: the most important property, vapour pressure, is difficult to measure and a broad range of values have been published for many active ingredients. Water solubility is not determined easily, either. Above all, these properties are usually measured for the active ingredient only but not for the formulated product. Fuzzy logic provides a means of quantifying vague knowledge of processes and properties.

In a well plate assay with J2, DA applied at 500, 250 and 125 ppm resulted in 100, 95 and 55% mortality, respectively, while MH showed 80% mortality even at the lower concentration of 63 ppm. MH gave stronger HIA than DA at 1000 and 500 ppm. In addition, alpha-pinene, camphor, borneol and p-menthole, which are the main components of DA and MH extracts, showed strong nematicidal properties and HIA. In particular, the nematicidal activity of p-menthole among them was the highest and its HIA was also stronger than that of cadusafos and fosthiazate. In a container test using emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and granule (G) formulations containing 50 and 30% DA and MH, respectively, EC of D. aromatica showed a stronger LC50 value (0.203 mu l (g soil)(-1)) than G formulation (0.935 mg (g soil)(-1)). However, their effects were fewer than MH formulations. The lethality of EC and G formulations containing MH was comparable to that of fosthiazate soluble concentrate and granule formulations. In another test using pots containing soils naturally infected by M. incognita, these plant formulations significantly inhibited the nematode-population density judging from the number of galls that formed on tested tomato roots after 8 weeks. These results suggest that DA and MH methanol extracts, as well as their constituents, might be useful as management agents against M. incognita.",2014,16,193,200,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-00002757

The widespread use of synthetic pesticides have led to concerns regarding their environmental fate and their effects on pollinators. While the impact of insecticides on bees has received substantial attention, relatively little is known about the consequences of the use of non-insecticidal pesticides for bee health, and no comprehensive review is available. Here, we used a standardized method to review scientific papers with classifiable outcomes on bee health of noninsecticidal applications (i.e., fungicides, herbicides, and other non-specific pesticides) and their interactive effect on bee health. We comprehensively summarize for the first-time overall outcomes and outcomes per bee species, as well as the individual and combinatory outcomes for specific chemicals, types, and classes. The available information indicates minimal impact for nearly all fungicides and fungicide combinations, confirming that, with some exceptions, fungicides are not as harmful as insecticides. However, when interactions were found, fungicide-fungicide combinations were just as harmful as fungicide-insecticide interactions. Herbicide and other groups were more harmful than fungicides and showed similar interactive effects. Because exposure to multiple chemicals is likely to be common in most agricultural landscapes, we recommend that the detrimental interactive effects through co-application be made available on pesticide labels.",2021,314,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107423

Early studies on the potential of H3PO3 and its salts as alternative phosphate fertilizers showed that these phosphorus (P)-containing materials were not as effective as phosphoric acids (H3PO4) and its derivatives on growth of the first crop in successive cropping trials. However, a definite growth response to phosphite was seen when compared to the zero-P control, proving that these materials provided nutritional support. Beneficial effects from the phosphite and H3PO3 treatments were observed in the subsequent crops, and were presumed attributable to the probable conversion of phosphite to phosphate in the soil. Studies done more than thirty years later on plant responses to the phosphite anion focused on plant disease control, rather than on the nutrient qualities of such materials. Nevertheless, many plant physiological phenomena caused by the phosphite-active ingredient were discovered as its chemical dynamics were documented. Effects important to plant growth were shown to occur when plants were treated with H3PO3 or its salts even in the absence of plant pathogens. Whereas a certain amount of observed nutritional responses to phosphite is correlated with its conversion to orthophosphate by microbial action and other mechanisms, other nutritional responses were also observed, leading to commercialization of specially formulated H3PO3 derivatives as fertilizers. For example, higher yields in oranges were directly attributed to increased flowering and fruit set after winter pre-bloom foliar applications of commercial phosphite fertilizer formulations. Many horticultural and agronomic crops have exhibited positive growth responses under field conditions to the nutritional support available in fertilizers derived from H3PO3.",2000,23,161,180,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904160009382006

The entomological outcomes tested were anti-feeding effect (proportion of female sandflies unfed), lethal effect (24-h female sandfly mortality) and these two effects combined, and the insecticide persistence time at 50% (residual activity, RA(50)) and 80% (RA(80)) efficacy. On initial application, the proportions of female flies that demonstrated anti-feeding activity or were killed were similar for both formulations, at 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.856-0.977) vs. 0.81 (95% CI 0.763-0.858) (anti-feeding) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.787-0.920) vs. 0.76 (95% CI 0.698-0.817) (24-h mortality) for EC and SC, respectively. The RA50 rates for anti-feeding and mortality caused by the EC formulation were 4.7 months (95% CI 4.18-5.84) and 2.5 months (95% CI 2.25-2.90), respectively, compared with 1.1 months (95% CI 0.96-1.15) and 0.6 months (95% CI 0.50-0.61), respectively, for the SC formulation.

The four-to six-fold superior residual activity of the EC formulation was attributed to the addition of a solvent-soluble resin in the formulation which improved fur adhesion and acted as a reservoir for the slow release of the active ingredient. These results identify the potential of such a low-cost formulation to reduce the inter-intervention interval to 5-6 months, similar to that recommended for deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars or for re-impregnation of conventional bednets, both of which are currently used to combat Leishmania transmission.

Our review describes the effects of exposure to G or GBHs on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in males and females in terms of endocrine disruption, cell viability, and proliferation. Most of the main regulators of the reproductive axis (GPR54, GnRH, LH, FSH, estradiol, testosterone) are altered at all levels of the HPG axis (hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, testis, placenta, uterus) by exposure to GBHs which are considered more toxic than G alone due to the presence of formulants such as polyoxyethylene tallow amine (POEA).  In addition, we report intergenerational impacts of exposure to G or GBHs and, finally, we discuss different strategies to reduce the negative effects of GBHs on fertility.",2021,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells10113079

Application of azole fungicides has been shown to affect fitness of Z. tritici variants differentially, so it has been hypothesized that combinations of azoles could slow the evolution of resistance. This work assessed the effects of dose, mixtures and alternations of two azoles on selection for isolates with reduced sensitivity and on disease control. Naturally infected field trials were carried out at six sites across Ireland and the sensitivity of Z. tritici isolates monitored pre- and post-treatment. Epoxiconazole and metconazole were applied as solo products, in alternation with each other, and as a pre-formulated mixture. Full and half label doses were tested. Isolates were partially cross-resistant to the two azoles, with a common azole resistance principal component accounting for 75% of the variation between isolates. Selection for isolates with reduced azole sensitivity was correlated with disease control. Decreased doses were related to decreases in sensitivity but the effect was barely significant (P = 0.1) and control was reduced. Single applications of an active ingredient (a.i.) caused smaller decreases in sensitivity than double applications. Shifts in sensitivity to the a.i. applied to a plot were greater than to the a.i. not applied, and the decrease in sensitivity was greater to the a.i. applied at the second timing. These results confirm the need to mix a.i.s with different modes of action.",2016,65,124,136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppa.12395

For the ozonation process the primary involvement of free radical species such as OH. in the oxidative reaction could be demonstrated via inspection of ozone absorption rates. Alkaline ozonation and the photo-Fenton's reagents both appeared to be the most promising AOPs in terms of COD (49-66%) and TOC (42-52%) abatement rates, whereas the BOD5 of the originally non-biodegradable effluent could only be improved to a value of 100 mg/L with O-3/pH = 3 treatment (BOD5/COD, f = 0.08). Evaluation on COD and TOC removal rates per applied active oxidant (AOx) and oxidant (Ox) on a molar basis revealed that alkaline ozonation and particularly the UV-light assisted Fenton processes enabling good oxidation yields (1-2 mol COD and TOC removal per AOx and Ox) by far outweighed the other studied AOPs. Separate experimental studies conducted with the penicillin active substance amoxicillin trihydrate indicated that the aqueous antibiotic substance can be completely eliminated after 40 min advanced oxidation applying photo-Fenton's reagent (pH = 3; Fe2+:H2O2 molar ratio = 1:20) and alkaline ozonation (at pH = 11.5), respectively.

Although mancozeb has been detected in surface waters, studies addressing the genotoxic risk to fish arising from the use of this formulation, testing environmentally realistic concentrations, are absent from the literature. Hence, this work aimed to investigate the DNA and chromosome damaging potential of Mancozan (R) (0.29 and 2.9 mu g L-1) in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.), after a short-term exposure (3 days), through the adoption of the comet and the erythrocytic nuclear abnormality (ENA) assays. In addition, it was intended to elucidate the subjacent damage mechanisms, improving the comet assay with the adoption of the endonucleases formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (EndoIII), which detect oxidized bases. The highest Mancozan (R) concentration was able to affect the DNA integrity (comet assay), while the adoption of endonucleases pointed out an oxidative cause to the damage. Regarding the chromosomal damage (ENA assay), both concentrations displayed significant effects, revealing the clastogenic and/or aneugenic properties of Mancozan (R). Furthermore, the two genotoxic endpoints were significantly correlated.

Thus, NOVAD is a sustainable product with wide use potential in crop protection. Both components of the product are adjuvants and we will demonstrate the property as an enhancer of penetration of various model compounds and selected active ingredients in this study. The product acts as a foliar penetration enhancer in particular, because the mobility of active ingredients in the plant cuticle is rapidly increased and active availability in the deposit is high. Plant compatibility indications are excellent across all major grain and fiber crops, as well as various fruit crops, vegetable crops, and ornamental plants.

However, because of the complexity of these systems, in most cases there is no readily available means to predict emulsion stability. Thus, product formulation development is based on laboratory evaluations of emulsion stability, e.g., by measuring the time required for the emulsion to break according to standardized procedures. These tests are time-consuming and subject to visual inaccuracies between different operators. In this work, a neural network-based model is tested as a tool for predicting the emulsification properties of mixtures of surfactants, organic solvents, and organic compounds used as active ingredients in pesticide formulations. The model is able to predict the emulsion-breaking height, a standard measure of the system's stability. Six physicochemical properties were used as descriptors for the active ingredients: octanol/water partition coefficient, molar volume, refractive index, density, Hildebrand solubility parameter, and Henry's constant. The solvents and their mixtures were described by their density, Hildebrand solubility parameter, and surface tension. Other input variables include water hardness and the concentrations of active ingredient and surfactant. The output variable was the volume percentage of cream formation after dispersion of the emulsifiable concentrate in water, represented by the emulsion-breaking height, predicted by the neural network model. In a different approach, nonionic surfactants were described by their average hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) number. The loss of information in the neural network resulted in inaccurate estimates of cream formation. Nevertheless, with this approach, the neural network was able to discriminate between regions of emulsion stability and instability. Application of the method enabled the construction of phase diagrams for the prediction of the optimum surfactant mixture(s) for emulsification of a given combination of solvent and active ingredient. The method can reduce the time needed for formulation development, minimize the exposure of the formulator to chemicals, and avoid unnecessary production of effluent in product test facilities.",2007,46,5100,5107,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie070337a

In summary, these data indicate that the lethal effects on zebrafish early-life stages can be ranked in the following order from most to least toxic: surfactant POEA > formulation ATN > active ingredient GLY approximate to metabolite AMPA. Genotoxic effects were observed in both RTG-2 cells (only POEA) and zebrafish (all test compounds) with the lowest tested concentrations. Therefore, it is important to evaluate different toxicological endpoints as well as use different non-target organisms to predict the hazards of GLY-based formulations and their components and breakdown product to aquatic biota.",2019,842,94,101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mrgentox.2019.05.002

We focused our work on a mixture of three herbicides commonly applied on maisP crops within a fortnight, namely mesotrione (beta-triketone), nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea) and S-metolachlor (chloroacetanilide). The metabolic pathways of mesotrione and nicosulfuron were qualitatively and quantitatively determined with a bacterial strain (Bacillus megaterium Mes11). This strain was isolated from an agricultural soil and able to biotransform both these herbicides. Although these pathways were unaffected in the case of binary or ternary herbicide mixtures, kinetics of nicosulfuron disappearance and also of mesotrione and nico-sulfuron metabolite formation was strongly modulated. The toxicity of the parent compounds and metabolites was evaluated for individual compounds and mixtures with the standardized Microtoxa (R) test.

Now that the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism is well understood, it is time to consider how to apply the acquired knowledge to agriculture and crop protection. Some RNAi-based products are already available for farmers and more are expected to reach the market soon. Tailor-made dsRNA as an active ingredient for biopesticide formulations is considered a raw material that can be used for diverse purposes, from pest control and bee protection against viruses to pesticide resistance management. The RNAi mechanism works at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, exploiting a sequence-dependent mode of action, which makes it unique in potency and selectivity compared with conventional agrochemicals. Furthermore, the use of RNAi in crop protection can be achieved by employing plant-incorporated protectants through plant transformation, but also by non-transformative strategies such as the use of formulations of sprayable RNAs as direct control agents, resistance factor repressors or developmental disruptors. In this review, RNAi is presented in an agricultural context (discussing products that have been launched on the market or will soon be available), and we go beyond the classical presentation of successful examples of RNAi in pest-insect control and comprehensively explore its potential for the control of plant pathogens, nematodes and mites, and to fight against diseases and parasites in beneficial insects. Moreover, we also discuss its use as a repressor for the management of pesticide-resistant weeds and insects. Finally, this review reports on the advances in non-transformative dsRNA delivery and the production costs of dsRNA, and discusses environmental considerations.

The occurrence of deltamethrin in the aquatic environment is well-established, but the possible genotoxic effects of Decis (R) in non-target organisms, namely fish, remain unknown. Hence, this work aimed to evaluate the cytogenetic damaging potential of Decis (R) in European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.), adopting the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assay. In addition, it was intended to investigate the damage progression in the post-exposure period. The frequency of immature erythrocytes (IE) was also determined to provide indirect information on the erythrocyte catabolism and erythropoiesis rate. Fish were exposed to 17.5 and 35 mu g L-1 of Decis (R) (equivalent to 0.05 and 0.1 mu g L-1 of deltamethrin, respectively) during 1 and 3 days. Thereafter, fish were transferred to clean water and kept for I, 7 and 14 days. The results demonstrated a clear potential to induce chromosomal damage following 3 days exposure, depicted in an ENA frequency increase for both Decis (R) concentrations. The transient nature of this cytogenetic damage was also demonstrated, as ENA frequency returned to the control level 1 and 7 days after cessation of the exposure, respectively for the higher and the lower Decis (R) concentration. Moreover, this response pattern suggested a rapid metabolization and elimination of the formulation constituents by A. anguilla, combined with an increased erythrocyte turnover in fish exposed to the higher Decis (R) concentration, as pointed out by the IE frequency rise. Overall, the demonstrated genotoxic properties of Decis (R) pointed out increased risk factors to fish exposed to this insecticide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It invaded Africa during 2016, causing important economic damages, forcing African countries to take urgent actions to tackle this new invasive pest. In Burkina Faso, several chemical insecticides were promoted, but farmers have quickly and repeatedly reported control failures. In this work, we collected seven fall armyworm populations in as many maize-producing areas of Burkina Faso. Following the approved IRAC leaf bioassay protocol, we evaluated the susceptibility of third instar larvae to seven commercially available insecticide formulations, including various modes of action: methomyl and chlorpyriphos-ethyl (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin (sodium channel modulators), emamectin benzoate and abamectin (chloride channel activators) and Bacillus thuringiensis (a microbial disruptor of insect midgut membranes). Lethal concentrations (LC50), resistance ratios (RR50) and relative toxicity were calculated for each population and active ingredient. LC50 values for all S. frugiperda populations were, in order of importance: emamectin benzoate (0.33-0.38 mu g/l), methomyl (18-73 mg/l), abamectin (58-430 mg/l), chlorpyrifos-ethyl (199-377 mg/l), deltamethrin (70-541 mg/l) and lambda-cyhalothrin (268-895 mg/l). LC50 of the B. thuringiensis formulation ranged from 430 to 614 MIU/l. Lambda-cyhalothrin was the least efficient of the tested chemical pesticides, and emamectin benzoate the most efficient (relative toxicity x2 712 969). Methomyl (x49), abamectin (x15), deltamethrin (x13), chlorpyriphos-ethyl (x4) were also more toxic than lambda-cyhalothrin. Based on these results, we conclude that emamectin benzoate, methomyl and chlorpyriphos-ethyl insecticides are the most efficient for the control of the fall armyworm in Burkina Faso.

It was introduced in the late 1950s, but its use has been controversial because of its high potential for environmental contamination. In agriculture, the implementation of sustainable practices can help in reducing the adverse effects atrazine. This review addresses aspects related to the impacts of atrazine in the environment, with focus on its effects on aquatic species, as well as the potential use of nanoencapsulation to decrease the impacts of atrazine. The application of atrazine leads to its dispersal beyond the immediate area, with possible contamination of soils, sediments, plantations, pastures, public supply reservoirs, groundwater, streams, lakes, rivers, seas, and even glaciers. In aquatic ecosystems, atrazine can alter the biota, consequently interfering in the food chains of many species, including benthic organisms. Nanoformulations loaded with atrazine have been developed as a way to reduce the adverse impacts of this herbicide in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Ecotoxicological bioassays have shown that this nanoformulations can improve the targeted delivery of the active ingredient, resulting in decreased dosages to obtain the same effects as conventional formulations. However, more detailed analyses of the ecotoxicological potential of atrazine-based nanoherbicides need to be performed with representative species of different ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The introduction of numerous new active ingredients and commercial pesticide formulations in connection with reports on pesticide-related health problems strongly indicate that the analytical procedures should be tested and evaluated for currently used pesticides. Coping with matrix effects and ensuring pesticide stability when samples are taken in remote areas are paramount. In the present study, we tested an analytical method that targets nine currently used pesticides in surface water in northern Vietnam. The method consists of solid phase extraction, storage at -18 degrees C in the adsorbed state, and capillary gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus-detection of five insecticides (dichlorvos, fenobucarb, dimethoate, fenitrothion, and chlorpyrifos), three fungicides (chlorothalonil, metalaxyl, and edifenphos) and one herbicide (atrazine). We evaluated the potential analytical bias caused by matrix effect and investigated its possible causes. We also tested the long-term stability (up to 9 months) of pesticides adsorbed to Carbopack SPE cartridges when stored at temperatures below -18 degrees C. Adopting a matrix-matched calibration technique considerably improved the recovery values of seven of the nine tested pesticides. At spiking levels of 0.1 mu g L-1 and 1 mu g L-1 and after storage of 119 days at -18 degrees C, recovery values of these pesticides ranged from 67% to 107% and from 67% to 155%, respectively. For the remaining two pesticides recovered at 53-55% at both spiking levels - dichlorvos and chlorothalonil - the method could still be useful for semi-quantitative analysis or as a screening tool. Even though the general recommendation is to minimise storage time to reduce pesticides degradation, our results showed that storage times up to nine months can be adopted for atrazine, metalaxyl, fenitrothion, and chlorpyrifos.",2012,92,797,809,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2010.532872

Wilding conifers can also enhance damaging fires and in water limited catchments can affect surface flows and aquifer recharge. A range of herbicide treatments was aerially applied by boom to a field trial established within a wilding Pinus contorta (Dougl.) (height range 1.5 - 12 m) infestation. Measurements of mortality taken two years post herbicide application were used to examine variation in efficacy of these herbicides using a mixed-effects model that tested the main and interactive effects of tree height and herbicide treatment on mortality. For a treatment to be considered effective, a mortality rate of over 85% should be achieved. Findings: Herbicide treatment was found to significantly affect mortality. Application of herbicides that included triclopyr (18 kg a.i. ha(-1)) and dicamba (5 kg a.i. ha(-1)) applied in combination or these active ingredients applied with picloram (2 kg a.i. ha(-1)) were found to effectively control P. contorta across the treated height range inducing respective mortality rates of 88 and 89%.

Crustacean zooplankton communities were examined by multivariate ordination (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and time-course analyses of population trends among indicator taxa over two field seasons to determine application effects on community structure and recovery patterns. Significant effects on zooplankton community structure were detected at all main test concentrations (n = 5) of 28, 17, and 10 mug L-1 azadirachtin. There was also evidence of adverse effects on zooplankton communities at an auxiliary test concentration (n = 2) of 5 mug L-1 azadirachtin. Community-level effects resulted primarily from reductions in adult copepods with short-term, reciprocal increases in cladocerans. Copepod nauplii were not significantly affected. Response patterns suggested that the reductions in adult copepods resulted from growth-regulating effects of the active ingredient azadirachtin, or other neem compounds, and not from formulation ingredients. There was no evidence of recovery among adult copepods within the season of application. At the beginning of the second sampling season, there were apparent carryover effects similar to the community responses in the previous year. By the end of the second season, there was evidence indicating recovery of community structure at the two lower test concentrations of 10 and 17 mug L-1, but not at 28 mug L-1. The selective toxicity to adult copepods is problematic in that this group has a relatively long life cycle (1 year), contributes a major component of zooplankton biomass and respiration, and occupies critical functional guilds within zooplankton food web structures. Mitigation measures such as reductions in application rates and efforts to avoid deposition of sprayed materials on water bodies will be required to reduce the risk of harmful effects on zooplankton communities of forest ponds and other shallow, standing-water bodies.

This study aims to elucidate how CPD photolyase (Phr1) and 6-4PP photolyase (Phr2) repair DNA damage and photoreactivate UVB-inactivated cells in Beauveria bassiana, a main source of fungal insecticides. Both Phr1 and Phr2 are proven to exclusively localize in the fungal nuclei. Despite little influence on growth, conidiation, and virulence, singular deletions of phr1 and phr2 resulted in respective reductions of 38% and 19% in conidial tolerance to UVB irradiation, a sunlight component most harmful to formulated conidia. CPDs and 6-4PPs accumulated significantly more in the cells of Delta phr1 and Delta phr2 mutants than in those of a wild-type strain under lethal UVB irradiation and were largely or completely repaired by Phr1 in the Delta phr2 mutant and Phr2 in the Delta phr1 mutant after optimal 5-h exposure to visible light. Consequently, UVB-inactivated conidia of the Delta phr1 and Delta phr2 mutants were much less efficiently photo-reactivated than were the wild-type counterparts. In contrast, overexpression of either phr1 or phr2 in the wildtype strain resulted in marked increases in both conidial UVB resistance and photoreactivation efficiency. These findings indicate essential roles of Phr1 and Phr2 in photoprotection of B. bassiana from UVB damage and unveil exploitable values of both photolyase genes for improved UVB resistance and application strategy of fungal insecticides. IMPORTANCE Protecting fungal cells from damage from solar UVB irradiation is critical for development and application of fungal insecticides but is mechanistically not understood in Beauveria bassiana, a classic insect pathogen.

Ethyl cellulose microspheres loaded with norfluazon were prepared by the solvent-evaporation method. To obtain the microspheres, certain conditions (pesticide/polymer ratio, percentage of emulsifying agent and solvent) were varied. The shape and size of the microspheres obtained were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Other parameters, such as solids recovery, encapsulation efficiency and pesticide loading, were also studied. The release rate of norfluazon from the different microspheres was slower than that of pure norfluazon. In particular, microspheres obtained with o-xylene, which provided the largest diameter, retarded the initial release of the pesticide relative to microspheres obtained with chloroform, or to pure norfluazon. Moreover, the studies showed that the pesticide/polymer ratio controlled the release of norfluazon, which was slower when this ratio was low. Release rates conformed to a generalised kinetic equation for a diffusion-controlled release mechanism, and the time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, t(50) was calculated.

1468,Cecylia,not vetted,"Belden, JB; Brain, RA",Incorporating the joint toxicity of co-applied pesticides into the ecological risk assessment process,INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT,"Pesticides are frequently formulated as mixtures of active ingredients. Although traditionally ecological risk assessments (ERAs) have focused on individual active ingredients, there is an ongoing effort in many jurisdictions to more formally include assessment of mixtures. The overall goal of this project was to describe an approach for conducting ERA of jointly applied pesticides. We suggest that standard testing of formulation mixtures is not warranted due to the low probability of synergy occurring at a high-enough magnitude to be measurable above experimental variability. Thus, empirical testing should focus on formulations for which there is a greater likelihood of synergy due to known toxicological interactions of the pesticide class or a priori knowledge of synergy, such as intellectual property claims. Additionally, empirical testing should focus on species that are above levels of concern and limit testing on species for which it is unlikely that synergy would significantly change the outcome of the ERA. If empirical testing is warranted, we suggest that results be compared to the concentration addition model (CA). If the empirical data deviates from the model by a factor of greater than 5, then synergy is considered likely and the ERA is based on the empirical data. Otherwise, the ERA may use CA to calculate risk quotients or be based on the most toxic active ingredient. To evaluate the approach, we reviewed formulation mixtures for which data were available. Only 3 of 24 mixture studies were found to deviate from CA by more than 5. The majority of the studies had a single component that dominated toxicity, suggesting that the ERA for these formulations will not be meaningfully different if based on the most toxic active ingredient. Overall, this approach balances risk assessment conservatism and reduces testing that would likely not result in improvement of the ERA. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2018;14:79-91.

In the Flooding Pampa where native grasslands were not replaced by crops, glyphosate is frequently sprayed in late-summer every year to increase winter forage productivity for cattle without knowing the impacts on both aboveground and belowground grassland genetic resources. Here, we evaluated the effect of this practice on the abundance and community structure of members of the genus Pseudomonas, one of the most diverse bacterial taxa of the plant rhizosphere broadly recognized by their benefits on plant growth and protection, and on soil remediation. In a field experiment, we analyzed the impact of a single application or of a repeated annual application during 4 consecutive years of the recommended dose of commercial glyphosate (Glacoxan (R), 3 l ha(-1) and 1440 g active ingredient ha(-1)). In a greenhouse experiment, we tested whether exposure of bare soil to either commercially formulated or pure glyphosate has a direct impact on the resident pseudomonas community in the absence of plants. In the field, we found that the repeated annual herbicide application resulted in a reduction in the abundance and a shift in the community structure of culturable pseudomonads, with evidence of an enrichment of glyphosate-metabolizing lineages. On the other hand, a single application of glyphosate to bare soil under greenhouse conditions did not affect the abundance nor the community structure of pseudomonads. Considering that these plant-beneficial bacteria are natural inhabitants of the rhizosphere and that their fitness is promoted by plant root exudates, the observed alterations are most likely associated with the drop in the vegetation cover directly provoked by the effect of glyphosate. For the first time, we report on the consequences that a reiterated glyphosate application has on a diverse soil reservoir of bacteria that contributes to crucial ecosystem functions in a temperate natural grassland under animal production. Our findings strengthen the notion that this agronomical practice has an unavoidable imprint on non-target microorganisms that are relevant components of the plant-soil feedbacks and that may be instrumental for ecosystem restoration. We conclude that it is necessary to develop sustainable management practices to avoid affecting key functional microorganisms and exploit their contributions to society.",2021,319,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107503

It is absorbed after foliar application and quickly translocated inside the plant. In this study, we investigated the effects of Roundup speed, a commercial glyphosate formulation, on the structural composition (dominance of microbial groups, phospholipid fatty acid analysis-PLFA) and functional diversity (use of carbon sources, Multiple Substrate Induced Respiration- MSIR) of soil microorganisms. We specifically aimed at understanding the potential impact of biotic interactions on herbicide effects and included plants, earthworms, and endomycorrhizal fungi in the experimental setup. For this, we grew clover (Triton= repens) in the greenhouse and added mycorrhizal inoculum (Glomus mosseae) and earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) to the pots. Two weeks after foliar Roundup application and subsequent plant death, the pots were destructively sampled. The application resulted in a significant increase of microbial respiration (SIR) by approximately 30%. A multivariate analysis of the MSIR data exhibited small but significant differences between the microbial communities of treated and untreated pots, while no significant difference was apparent for the PLFA data. Bacterial PLFAs generally decreased following herbicide application, while mycorrhizal and fungal PLFAs were not affected. We did not find a consistent difference between the fatty acid markers of gram negative and gram positive bacteria. For all investigated parameters, there were highly significant differences between the upper (0-5 cm depth) and lower (5-10 cm) soil layers. The fact that rooting density differed by a factor of 3.5 between the two layers indicated that herbicide effects were especially pronounced in the clover rhizosphere and were likely due to changes in root exudate composition. We found significant, though very small, interactions between Roundup and other experimental factors (especially mycorrhizal inoculum).",2019,174,506,513,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.02.073

A major constraint on the wider adoption of biopesticides is their susceptibility to the ultraviolet (UV: 290-400 nm) radiation in sunlight, which limits their persistence and efficacy. Here, we describe a novel formulation technology for biopesticides in which the active ingredient (baculovirus) is micro-encapsulated in an ENTOSTAT wax combined with a UV absorbant (titanium dioxide, TiO2). Importantly, this capsule protects the sensitive viral DNA from degrading in sunlight, but dissolves in the alkaline insect gut to release the virus, which then infects and kills the pest. We show, using simulated sunlight, in both laboratory bioassays and trials on cabbage and tomato plants, that this can extend the efficacy of the biopesticide well beyond the few hours of existing virus formulations, potentially increasing the spray interval and/or reducing the need for high application rates. The new formulation has a shelf-life at 30 degrees C of at least 6 months, which is comparable to standard commercial biopesticides and has no phytotoxic effect on the host plants. Taken together, these findings suggest that the new formulation technology could reduce the costs and increase the efficacy of baculovirus biopesticides, with the potential to make them commercially competitive alternatives to synthetic chemicals.",2020,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70293-7

In this study we assessed the response of M. convecta larvae to four alternative compounds using topical and dietary bioassays. RESULTS Emamectin benzoate [LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% of insects tested) values 2.69 mu g mL(-1) topical, 0.017 mu g active ingredient (AI) g(-1) dietary] and chlorantraniliprole (LC50 values 4.87 mu g mL(-1) topical, 0.080 mu g AI g(-1) dietary) were significantly more active than either indoxacarb or cyantraniliprole. Our results showed strong parallels with data on the more extensively studied Australian strains of Helicoverpa armigera, with the most notable differences being the higher contact toxicity of emamectin benzoate to M. convecta and the lower acute dietary activity of formulated cyantraniliprole to this species, which was linked to feeding deterrence. Cyantraniliprole at dietary concentrations of >= 0.02 mu g AI g(-1) significantly reduced the weight of surviving larvae and frass production (an indirect measure of food consumption) over the seven-day exposure period. There was also some evidence of chlorantraniliprole deterring larval feeding, although to a much more limited extent. CONCLUSIONS Both emamectin benzoate and chlorantraniliprole are suitable for use against M. convecta.

Three alkaline soil types, representative of farm soils in SE Australia, were used for these experiments. Laboratory tests of initial bioefficacy using a Mallee sand (pH 7.2) were able to detect, within ED05-95 limits, that approximately 50% of active ingredient remained as a non-available reserve in DT26B immediately after spraying, when compared with the granular formation. There was also an indication that the bioavailable component of active ingredient in DT26B would be sufficient for weed control. This was confirmed at field sites on a Kattyoong sand (pH 7.9) and a Wimmera Grey clay (pH 8.4), after using recommended application rates of chlorsulfuron during the 1994 winter growing season. The formulations produced only marginal differences in control of Lolium rigidum Gaud. The field leaching trials at these sites showed that there can be rapid leaching of chlorsulfuron with only small amounts of rainfall. Under these conditions, there was an overall trend of reduced leaching by DT26B at both trial sites, although these reductions were not significant when compared with the granular formation. A laboratory system designed to measure the mobility of herbicides is described. It was used to impose upon each formulation a greater level of leaching than in the field trials, using Mallee sand columns irrigated with 50 mm day(-1) under -50 kPa suction. This test revealed a negligible reduction in leaching of chlorsulfuron by DT26B as compared with the granular formulation. Therefore, although the controlled-release formulation DT26B demonstrated that it could provide a viable alternative for weed control under conventional spraying conditions in arable farming, the agricultural usage of DT26B for the purpose of reducing leaching could not be warranted at its current stage of development.",1997,37,19,26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1997.tb01818.x

In the last few decades, the interest concerning the formulation of botanical based biopesticides increased, but little research investigated the suitability of these approaches for B. oleae control. This research aimed to investigate the residual contact toxicity and the oviposition deterrence of three essential oil (EO)-based nano-emulsions (Pimpinella anisum, Foeniculum vulgare, Mentha x piperita) against B. oleae adult flies. All the nano-emulsions possessed optimal physical characteristics, with droplets dimensions ranging from 115 to 152 nm and low PDI values (<0.2), even after 1 year of storage. Although no notable residual contact toxicity was noted, all the tested formulations reduced the number of oviposition puncture in no-choice tests (percent repellence: mint < fennel < anise). In choice trials, olives treated with fennel and anise EO-formulations at the highest concentration (7.5%, 75 g of EO/L) were less attractive respect to control fruits and a significant reduction of olive punctures was recorded. Nano-biopesticides are promising eco-friendly tools to integrate B. oleae pest management programs and to reduce the use of harmful conventional active ingredients.",2022,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae8030240

Although they are more toxic to insects, they have toxic effects in mammals. Pyrethroids were detected in 100% of farmed salmon with a mean concentration of 1.31 +/- 1.39 ng g(-1) ww and in 50% of wild salmon with a mean of 0.02 +/- 0.03 ng g(-1) ww. Cypermethrin and deltamethrin, the active ingredients of anti-sea lice formulations, represented 77 +/- 27% of the total contamination of farmed salmon. Although farmed salmon had higher concentrations than wild salmon, the daily intake of pyrethroids through salmon consumption was several orders of magnitude below the accepted daily intake (ADI). Thus, the pyrethroids treatment on salmon does not pose a threat on the health of the consumers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although various pathogens, including R. solani, have been traditionally controlled using chemical pesticides, their use faces drawbacks such as environmental pollution, development of pesticide resistance, and other negative effects. Carbendazim is a well-known antifungal agent capable of controlling a broad range of plant diseases, but its use is hampered by its poor aqueous solubility. In this study, we describe an environmentally friendly pharmaceutical microemulsion system using carbendazim as the active ingredient, chloroform and acetic acid as solvents, and the surfactants HSH and 0204 as emulsifiers. This system increased the solubility of carbendazim to 30 g/L. The optimal microemulsion formulation was determined based on a pseudo-ternary phase diagram; its physicochemical characteristics were also tested. The cloud point was greater than 90 degrees C and it was resistant to freezing down to -18 degrees C, both of which are improvements over the temperature range in which pure carbendazim can be used. This microemulsion meets the standard for pesticide microemulsions and demonstrated better activity against R. solani AG1-IA, relative to an aqueous solution of pure carbendazim (0.2 g/L).

Within two weeks, no effect of the herbicide was displayed by the Eumull population, while the Dysmoder population was stimulated. When animals were able to escape from the herbicide through a perforated wall separating two compartments filled with natural soil, the behavior of collembolan communities exhibited interactive (non-additive) effects of humus type and herbicide application. The combination of an acid soil (supposedly providing greater tolerance to organic pollutants) with a neutral soil, increased biodiversity of Collembola, but caused the disappearance of some acido-sensitive species, pointing to complex relationships between pesticides, soils and soil organisms.

The aim of the present study was to test the suitability of an attract-and-kill strategy consisting of pure pheromones and the contact insecticide cyfluthrin as the active ingredient, formulated with plant oils and ultraviolet absorbers, and applied in droplet sizes of 100 mu L. RESULTS: Cyfluthrin at a concentration of 5 g L-1 resulted in the highest and fastest killing of males after 48 h, with a 100% mortality after 3-4 days. In contrast, control males survived for 13 days. In olfactometer experiments, the pheromone concentration of 0.5 g L-1 was significantly most attractive against eight virgin females. At controlled conditions (20 degrees C), no reduction in efficacy of the attract-and-kill formulation was observed for a minimum period of 36 days, whereas under natural environmental conditions the efficacy reduced gradually after day 6 of exposure. The longer the droplet was exposed, the longer was the time to reach 100% mortality of males. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with attract-and-kill studies for other pest species, the results are promising as a means of achieving highly effective control of potato tuber moths under field conditions.

Fifty to 80 % of the applied dose penetrated within 2 h with concentrations ranging from 0.04 g/l to 2.0) g/l C12E8, respectively. Velocity of penetration was also increased by adding the polydisperse surfactant, Genapol C-100, which has a similar average formula and ethylene oxide content (C12.5E8.4). In contrast, Genapol C-200, wit h an average ethylene oxide content of 17 had no effect (at. 2 g/l on C12E8 penetration. It is suggested that C12E8 and other homologues of polydisperse surfactants diffuse independently and rates of penetration can be increased by those homologues which increase diffusivity in the cuticles. Homologues having this property are termed accelerators as they increase their own rates of diffusion but also rates of penetration of active ingredients which cross cuticles by following the accelerator front. They are useful additives if rapid penetration is desired, as with systemic active ingredients. Velocity of penetration of C12E8 in presence of Genapol surfactants did nor. depend on relative humidity (11-93%) and only slightly so if applied alone. However, surfactant penetration rates were greatly slowed in presence of CaCl2 (greater than or equal to 0.2 g/l) and other salts. This effect was largest at low (11%) humidity and diminished at higher (93 %) humidities.

The livers and serum samples of the offspring were collected on gestational day 19 (GD19), postnatal day 7 (PND7) and PND21. The results showed a significant decrease in the body weight and obvious hepatic steatosis with excessive lipid droplet formation in offspring. Moreover, the concentrations of lipids such as triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (T-CHO), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterols (LDL-C) increased to a significant extent in both the serum and livers. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the expression levels of the genes SREBP1C, SREBP2, Fasn, Hmgcr, Hmgcs and PPAR alpha, which are related to lipid biosynthesis or catabolism in the liver.

In this work, an intelligent redox and pectinase dual stimuli-responsive pesticide delivery system was constructed by bonding pectin with metal-organic frameworks (FeMOF nanoparticles) which were loaded with pyraclostrobin (PYR@FeMOF-pectin nanoparticles). The successful fabrication of PYR@FeMOF-pectin nanoparticles was proved by a series of physicochemical characterizations. The results indicated that the loading capacity of PYR@FeMOF-pectin nanoparticles for pyraclostrobin was approximately 20.6%. The pectin covered on the surface of PYR@FeMOF nanoparticles could protect pyraclostrobin from photolysis and improve their spreadability on rice blades effectively. Different biological stimuli associated with Magnaporthe oryzae could trigger the release of pyraclostrobin from the pesticide-loaded core-shell nanoparticles, resulting in the death of pathogens. The bioactivity survey determined that PYR@FeMOF-pectin nanoparticles had a superior fungicidal activity and a longer duration against Magnaporthe oryzae than pyraclostrobin suspension concentrate. In addition, the FeMOF-pectin nanocarriers showed no obvious phytotoxicity and could enhance the shoot length and root length of rice plants. More importantly, PYR@FeMOF-pectin nanoparticles had an 8-fold reduction in acute toxicity to zebrafish than that of pyraclostrobin suspension concentrate.

As filter feeders, freshwater mussels are particularly exposed. Like many native bivalve species, Unio pictorum suffers from a continuous decline in Europe. In order to get a deeper insight of its response to contaminants, U. pictorum was exposed to either 10 mu g L-1 of microcystin-LR or 10 mu g L-1 of glyphosate or a mixture of both. Proteins of the digestive glands were extracted and analyzed by DIGE. Gel analysis revealed 103 spots with statistical variations, and the response seems to be less toward glyphosate than to microcystin-LR. Specific spots have variations only when exposed to the mixture, showing that there is an interaction of both contaminants in the responses triggered. The proteins of 30 spots have been identified.

The weed flora was dominated by broad-leaved species. The most common broad-leaved weeds were Chenopodium album L., Galeopsis L. spp., Viola arvensis Murr. and Stellaria media (L.) Vill., and the most common grass weed was Elymus repens (L.) Gould. The density of weeds averaged 170 plants m(-2) (median 124), and the dry weight 320 kg ha(-1) (median 183). Ordination analyses revealed that the species composition of weed populations varied regionally and was affected by soil characteristics and crop management practices, particularly by long-term use of herbicides. An additional aspect studied in the survey was herbicide efficacy in farmers' fields. Phenoxy acid herbicides, MCPA, dichlorprop and mecoprop, were the most common active ingredients used in the 252 spring cereal fields surveyed. MCPA alone gave only a moderate control of 65%, determined as a reduction of weed biomass, whereas the efficacy of herbicide mixtures containing MCPA averaged 83%. Inadequate control was in most cases due to a wrong choice of active ingredient for the prevailing weed population. Reduction in the use of herbicides by applying lower doses than recommended was studied in field experiments. Herbicide formulations of MCPA/dichlorprop, MCPA/mecoprop and MCPA/fluroxypyr were screened in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields. The efficacy of herbicides, applied at the lowest recommended dose, averaged 85%. At a 30% lower dose the efficacy still reached 79%. Even lower herbicide doses were often adequate, depending on the herbicide, weed species and the crop. The production of weed biomass was adequately suppressed with reduced doses since the most common and aggressive species, such as Chenopodium album and Galeopsis spp., were efficiently controlled with low doses. Use of reduced herbicide doses for three years in the same field caused neither an increase in the subsequent weed infestation nor changes in the species composition of weed populations compared with the treatments at recommended rates of application. The percentage emergence of weeds averaged 70-75% at the time of herbicide application when the crop was at the 34 leaf growth stage. However, spraying during the early growth stages of those weeds that emerge in the main flush is recommended since the competitive ability of the crop is normally sufficient to suppress the growth of late-emerging weed seedlings. At harvest the proportion of weed biomass in unsprayed plots, as a proportion of the total vegetative biomass, averaged 3.1% in barley fields and 3.6% in wheat fields. The growth of weeds was more efficiently suppressed with reduced herbicide doses than by increasing the seeding rate of the crop. The mean yield gain remained below 5% at all rates of herbicide application. No reliable density-based threshold for chemical weed control was established. Instead, site-specific dose adjustment based on the composition and infestation level of the prevailing weed populations is suggested to reduce the total use of herbicides and to maintain the current low levels of weed infestation. Consequently, annual reductions of 30% in use of cereal herbicides are expected. Such a reduction corresponds to monetary savings of approximately FIM 20 million per annum at the national level.",1993,2,7,40,NA

In order to reach this objective, electrolytic conductivity measurements, laser diffraction, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and rheology were used. Electrolytic conductivity tests along with CLSM supported the formation of W/alpha-pinene/W multiple emulsions in all systems containing the most hydrophilic copolymer. Parameter R did not significantly influence either the mean diameters or the span when both copolymers were used. However the lack of Atlas G-5000, not only did it provoke an important increase of mean diameter of droplets, but it also caused the formation of a simple O/W emulsion instead of a multiple emulsion. All emulsions showed shear thinning flow behaviour. The mechanical spectra of multiple emulsions with R >= 2 were similar to each other and independent of aging time. A reduction of R led to a decrease in G' and G '' values and aging time yielded increasing G' values probably due to the occurrence of incipient creaming. Conversely, the emulsion without Atlas (TM) G-5000 showed a drop of viscoelastic moduli with aging time due to a coalescence process.

A high degree of trap catch shutdown (indicating mating suppression) was observed throughout the pheromone treated area during the whole of the season compared to non-pheromone treated farmer practice fields. Night observations confirmed that mating disruption occurred in the pheromone treated area as a smaller percentage of mated females were collected from this area compared to farmer practice fields. A majority of mated females collected from the pheromone treated area mated only once, whereas females in farmer practice fields had undergone multiple matings. A greater percentage of tethered female H. armigera moths retrieved from farmer practice fields had successfully mated compared to tethered females retrieved from the pheromone treated area. Release rate data of H. armigera pheromone from the formulation show that c. 70% was released during the two month trial period. However, the highly dispersive pre-oviposition flight behaviour of females meant that the area treated was not sufficient to eliminate the problem of gravid females migrating in from surrounding areas, and ovipositing therein. The implications of using the technique of mating disruption to control large strong flying insects like H. armigera are discussed.",2000,90,183,190,NA

Although chemical fungicides are still able to provide adequate control of mildews in most growing regions, fungicide resistance and other concerns have heightened the interest of manufacturers to develop alternative methods of control to replace chemicals. Ecogen Inc., has developed one suck product, AQ10(TM) biofungicide based on the hyperparasitic fungus Ampelomyces quisqualis, or A.q., for the control of powdery mildew disease (Uncinula necator) in gapes among other crops. The product was recently registered and launched for commercial sale in the United States. A product has also been submitted for registration in the EU where it is expected for the 1997 season. A.q. is produced using large-scale fermentation and is formulated as a stable water dispersible granule (WDG) containing fungal spores as the active ingredient. Germinating spores form hyphae that are capable of attacking and penetrating the propagating hyphae of the host via a very specific host-parasite interaction. This process will eventually lead to suppression and/or complete elimination of the powdery mildew pathogen. Results obtained in wine producing regions throughout the world have shown that powdery mildew can be effectively controlled with A.q., if applied to vines at stages where disease incidence is very low and good coverage of the entire vine canopy is attained. The product has also been successfully used in integrated pest management (IPM) programs occurring during bud-break, between bloom and bunch closure and just prior to veraison. The results of representative efficacy trials are discussed.",1996,NA,33,40,NA

In the present study, the electrospinning technique was used to produce nanoscale dispensers for attract-and-kill strategies. Non-woven nanofibres containing insecticide (cypermethrin) and (E)-8,(Z)-8-dodecenyl acetate and (Z)-8-dodecanol (0.87 mg L-1), the main components of Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) (Busck) pheromone, were evaluated in laboratory experiments. Male electroantennographic (EAG) responses and mortality (tarsal-contact and attract-and-kill behavioural cages) bioassays were performed for nanofibres (with and without insecticide) exposed for different periods (21, 42, 63 and 84 days) in controlled and non-exposed conditions. RESULTSThere were no significant differences in G. molesta male EAG responses based on the time of exposure within treatments. Nanofibres with pheromone only and with pheromone plus insecticide elicited equal EAG responses. Mortality in tarsal-contact bioassays was greater than 87% after exposure for 84 days. In the attract-and-kill bioassays, mortality ranged from 28.4 to 56.6%, although no difference was observed on insect mortalities over time (24, 48 and 72 h). CONCLUSIONIncorporation of cypermethrin in nanofibres did not interfere with G. molesta attractiveness. Both aspects of the strategy, the attractant and killing effects, were recorded using innovative nanofibres, and long-term effects suggest a controlled release of pheromone and insecticide.

Moreover, it is largely unknown to what extent different soil characteristics alter potential side effects of herbicides. We conducted a greenhouse experiment growing a model weed population of Amaranthus retroflexus in arable field soil with either 3.0 or 4.1% soil organic matter (SOM) content and treated these weeds either with GBHs (Roundup LB Plus, Touchdown Quattro, Roundup PowerFlex) or their respective AIs (isopropylammonium, diammonium or potassium salts of glyphosate) at recommended dosages. Control pots were mechanically weeded. Nontarget effects were assessed on the surface activity of the springtail species Sminthurinus niger (pitfall trapping) and litter decomposition in the soil (teabag approach). Both GBHs and AIs increased the surface activity of springtails compared to control pots; springtail activity was higher under GBHs than under corresponding AIs. Stimulation of springtail activity was much higher in soil with higher SOM content than with low SOM content (significant treatment x SOM interaction). Litter decomposition was unaffected by GBHs, AIs or SOM levels.

However, when the same two volume rates were created by varying the speed of a 11003 nozzle, clodinafop-propargyl efficacy was not affected by application volume, whereas fenoxaprop-P-ethyl remained more efficacious at 75 L ha(-1). This suggests that in the first experiment, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl efficacy was affected by changes in both spray quality and concentration, whereas only the former influenced clodinafop-propargyl efficacy. The hypothesis that the fenoxaprop-P-ethyl formulation was more influenced by concentration than clodinafop-propargyl was supported by dynamic surface tension studies and measures of active ingredient retention by oat plants. Within the practically relevant concentration range considered, surface activity of clodinafop-propargyl remained low, with little influence on herbicide retention. In contrast, depending on the concentration, surface activity of fenoxaprop-P-ethyl was below or above levels that were critical for its retention.

Currently, comparatively little is known about the influence of AI deposit patterns within a spray droplet residue area on the penetration and biological efficacy of glyphosate. A scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis has been used to characterise residue patterns and to quantify the area ultimately covered by glyphosate within the droplet spread area. RESULTS: The easy-to-wet weed species Stellaria media L. and Viola arvensis L., as well as the difficult-to-wet Chenopodium album L. and Setaria viridis L., differing in their surface micromorphology, have been used. Rapeseed oil ethoxylates (RSO 5 or RSO 60) were added to glyphosate solutions to provide different droplet spread areas. Addition of RSO 5 enhanced droplet spread area more than RSO 60, and both caused distinct glyphosate residue patterns. The biological efficacy of treatment solutions showed no significant correlation with the area ultimately covered by glyphosate. CONCLUSION: The results have implications on herbicide uptake models. This study shows that droplet spread area does not correspond to the area ultimately covered by glyphosate, and that the latter does not affect glyphosate phytotoxicity.

Makhteshim-Agan Ltd (Israel) has developed two new microencapsulated formulations of chlorpyrifos with a very low toxicity to humans and mammals (LD50 > 20,000 mg/kg). One of them (Master 25 cs) is a suspension of very small and uniform microcapsules (10 mu m) with precise thickness and flexibility of wall structure, which enables the prolonged release of the active ingredient from the capsule. This formulation contains 250 g/L chlorpyrifos. Another formulation (Master Quick) contains 6% of the pyrethroid deltamethrin in addition to chlorpyrifos. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the two new microencapsulated formulations of chlorpyrifos on the main stored-product insect pests, with a view to their use as protectants for stored products.

To determine the combined effect of the nematicides Velum and Purpureocillium lilacinum strain 251 formulated as wettable granulate (BioAct WG), we evaluated tomato yield parameters, gall index, soil and root nematode populations. Velum is a chemical nematicide with fluopyram as its active ingredient and BioAct is a biological nematicide based on the egg pathogenic fungus Purpureocilliwn lilacinum (strain 251). As a single treatment, the nematicide Velum showed better M. incognita reduction at-planting, while BioAct controlled the nematode population throughout the growing season. Greenhouse experiments in two consecutive years, showed that by combining the two nematicides, the M. incognita controlling effect was enhanced and the tomato yield increased compared to single nematicide treatments. The controlling effect of P. lilacinum was lower when M. incognita population increased, presumably based on its limiting ability to parasitize the increasing numbers of nematode eggs.

The effect on carbofuran release rate caused by the incorporation of bentonite, activated carbon, and different mixtures of both sorbents in alginate basic formulation was studied by immersion of the granules in water. The water uptake, sorption capacity of the sorbent, permeability, and time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, T-50, were calculated by the comparison of the preparations. T-50 values were higher for those formulations containing bentonite and/or activated carbon (T-50 values range from 14.76 h for the alginate formulation containing only bentonite as the sorbent to 29.5 weeks for the alginate formulation containing only activated carbon as the sorbent) than for the preparation without these sorbents (11.72 h). On the basis of a parameter of an empirical equation used to fit the insecticide-nernaticide release data, it appears that the release of carbofuran from the various formulations into water is controlled by a diffusion mechanism. The sorption capacity of the sorbents for carbofuran was the most important factor modulating carbofuran release.

To determine whether fish might be able to limit point-source exposures through sensory-driven behaviors, we introduced pulses of representative herbicide mixtures to individual adult zebrafish (a model species) in flow-through tanks. Fish did the opposite of limit exposure; they chose to spend more time in pulses of herbicide mixtures representative of those that may occur with rain events. This attraction response was not altered by a previous 4-d exposure to lower concentrations of the mixtures, suggesting fish will not learn from previous exposures. However, previous exposures did alter an attraction response to an amino acid prevalent in food (L-alanine). The present study demonstrates that fish living within urban waterways may elect to place themselves in herbicide-contaminated environments and that these exposures may alter their behavioral responses to cues necessary for survival.

The variables potentially influencing chemical fate and exposure define the exposure scenario while the variables determining effects at the ecosystem level define the ecological scenario. In absence of any empirical data, the objective of this paper is to present simulations by a fugacity-based fate model and a differential equation-based ecosystem model to theoretically explore how direct and indirect effects on invertebrate shallow pond communities vary with changing ecological and exposure scenarios. These simulations suggest that direct. and indirect effects are larger in mesotrophic systems than in oligotrophic systems. In both trophic states, interaction strength (quantified using grazing rates) was suggested a more important driver for the size and recovery from direct and indirect effects than immigration rate. In general, weak interactions led to smaller direct and indirect effects. For chemicals targeting mesozooplankton only, indirect effects were common in (simple) food-chains but rare in (complex) food-webs. For chemicals directly affecting microzooplankton, the dominant zooplankton group in the modelled community, indirect effects occurred both in food-chains and food-webs. We conclude that the choice of the ecological and exposure scenarios in ecotoxicological modelling efforts needs to be justified because of its influence on the prevalence and magnitude of the predicted effects. Overall, more work needs to be done to empirically test the theoretical expectations formulated here. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Flies were exposed to each bait alone in no-choice tests and to the bait plus sugar in choice tests. Golden Malrin was generally effective against the strains tested in no-choice tests; the lowest recorded knockdown after exposure for 48 h was 82%. Eight strains, however, gave a reduced knockdown when exposed in choice tests (between 60 and 87%). Golden Malrin was ineffective against one strain in choice tests with 7% knockdown at 48 h. With Alfacron 12 strains exhibited knockdown responses between 57 and 87% at: 48 h in no-choice tests. In choice tests, 17 strains gave knockdown responses of less than 50% at 48 h. Correlation coefficients were calculated for results from cage tests and levels of resistance to the active ingredients assessed using topical application and feeding test methods. There was a positive correlation between cage and feeding test results. Correlation was, however, less significant with choice test results than with no-choice results. There was no correlation between cage test and topical results. It is suggested that behavioural resistance was responsible for the reduced responses shown by some strains in choice tests compared to no-choice tests. The results demonstrate the importance of using a laboratory method which allows for behavioural differences when monitoring for resistance to insecticides formulated as baits. Behavioural differences in housefly strains should be considered when testing the efficacy of new bait formulations. It is also suggested that insecticide baits should not be used continuously and exclusively to control houseflies in intensive animal units.",1996,86,541,546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748530003933X

Using an adjuvant in spray liquid is an easy option for reducing droplet drift because there is no need to make any changes to the sprayer. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of seven commercially available adjuvants (Surfeco plus, Starguar, Kantor, Sterling, Control, Control WM, and Control DUO) with varying active ingredients on droplet size, surface tension, and viscosity. Since these properties affect droplet formation, these adjuvants were evaluated in terms of their drift-reducing performance in a wind tunnel at various wind speeds (2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 m/s) and spray pressures (3, 4, and 5 bars). The ground and airborne components of drift were evaluated. With the use of a patternator, the potential for the ground drift of adjuvants was measured; for airborne drift, polyethylene lines that were stretched along the cross-section area of the wind tunnel at various heights were employed. The number of deposits of a tracer dye-adjuvant mixture that was sprayed on the polyethylene lines was measured via fluorometric methods for determining the airborne drift potential. The test results showed that the adjuvant Control Duo containing a polymer blend, which had the highest dynamic viscosity (4.27 mPa.s), increased the Dv(0.5) droplet diameter up to 192 mu m at 3 bar with nozzle XR11002. This adjuvant reduced the ground drift potential (D-c) by 60.53% compared to tap water. The maximum airborne drift potential reduction percentage (DPRP) was obtained as 85.76% with Surfeco plus containing organic silicone at a pressure of 3 bar and a wind velocity of 5 m/s.

They provide a low cost and efficacious approach to pest control, where they may be employed both reactively and pre-emptively. It is likely insecticides will continue to play a role in meeting the challenge of feeding a growing global population. The widespread use of insecticides creates potential for negative impacts on non-target invertebrate populations. Many countries have regulatory processes in place to manage these. However, there regulatory processes have potential limitations when it comes to detecting the long-term and large-scale consequences of insecticide use. For example, long-term sub-lethal effects resulting from low dose exposure durations are rarely considered in toxicity tests, while predictable additive effects of mixtures of active ingredient are often ignored. In order to address this data gap, there is substantial scope for using existing spatially and temporally explicit biological records of species occurrence. This could help in monitoring and assessment to support our responsibilities to maintain biodiversity while continuing to grow enough food to feed the human population. How this is achieved poses several problems, both practical and analytical. Here, we describe how national-scale data on the spatial and temporal distribution of native invertebrates can be combined with maps of large-scale insecticide application and exposure risk to explore the actual consequences for non-target native biodiversity. Understanding these impacts on native invertebrates will provide a vital evidence base to inform policy decisions that could complement existing regulatory processes.",2020,63,93,126,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.aecr.2020.07.001

The innovative compound belongs to a new chemical class, the triazolo-pyrimidylamines. Initium controls all major oomycete pathogens, e. g., Plasmopara viticola in grapes, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, and Pseudoperonospora cubensis in cucurbits. Initium is a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor interfering with the complex III (complex bc1) in the electron transport chain of the pathogen, thus ATP synthesis in the fungal cells is inhibited. Research has demonstrated that Initium does not show cross-resistance to fungicide classes such as Qo inhibitors, phenylamides, and carboxylic acid amides. Initium is highly effective in inhibition of zoospore formation and release, zoosporangia release, motility, and germination. At low concentrations Initium leads to bursting of zoospores within a few seconds. Initium is a non-systemic fungicide that remains primarily on the leaf surface where it is adsorbed with high affinity to the epicuticular wax layer of the epidermis, and thus forms a stable protective film against fungal attack. To ensure sustainable use and to complement fungicidal properties, Initium is marketed in ready formulations with other compounds of different mode of action such as dimethomorph. In numerous field trials carried out worldwide, Initium applied either alone or in mixture with dimethomorph has been shown to be highly selective in a wide range of specialty crops and provides excellent oomycete control. Initium has an excellent toxicological and ecotoxicological profile and is highly suitable for use in integrated crop management systems.",2011,NA,143,148,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2011.917.18

Despite this, the use of G is currently under intense debate. Many studies indicating its hazard and toxicity on non-target organisms are emerging, and associations between GBHs and immune-endocrine disturbances have been described. This review aims to investigate, based on recent epidemiological studies and studies performed in vitro and in vivo in animals, the possible association between GBHs and immune-endocrine alterations. Published data suggest that GBHs have endocrine disrupting potentiality targeting sex and thyroid hormones, although its relevance for humans will require further investigations. Evidence of immunotoxicity are limited compared to those on endocrine effects, but overall highlight possible noxious effects, including lung inflammation and rhinitis. An attractive hypothesis could be the one that connects microbiota dysbiosis with possible immune-endocrine outcomes. Indeed, several intestinal microorganisms express the enzyme EPSPS and, studies are emerging that highlight a possible G-induced dysbiosis. Considering the wide use of GBHs in agriculture, further studies investigating their noxious effects at levels relevant for human exposure should be performed.

Controlled release of the herbicides was obtained by addition of selected minerals, including calcium bentonite, fine-grind bentonite, montmorillonite K10, kaolinite and iron (III) oxide. A formulation without clay was used as a comparison. The formulations tested had herbicide active ingredient contents ranging from similar to 0.02 to 0.54% and a nitrogen content of 21%.

The Precambrian Shield region of central Ontario, Canada, which is a major recreational area, is especially susceptible to the impacts of golf courses as a result of the geology and hydrology of the region. In a monitoring program at two golf courses in the Muskoka region conducted during the spring, summer, and fall of 2002, semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed into streams that drain the golf courses. The extracts from the SPMDs were tested for toxicity using bioassays with early life stages of an aquarium fish, the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Toxicity was assessed using a scoring system developed for the present study. The bioassays with medaka indicated that toxicity was highest in extracts from SPMDs deployed during the spring and the fall. The peaks in toxicity for the SPMDs deployed at the two golf courses corresponded with the presence in the SPMD extracts of pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) at concentrations up to 334 ng/SPMD. Quintozene is the turfgrass fungicide in which PCNB is the active ingredient. Pentachlorothioanisole, an anaerobic degradation product of PCNB, also was detected in the SPMDs deployed during the spring. Extracts prepared from SPMDs with high toxicity contained residues of a surfactant used in pesticide formulations, nonylphenol, at concentrations up to approximately 20 mu g/SPMD.

To better understand how these newer materials may work in management of European earwig, Forficula auricularia L., a systematic evaluation was done of formulated pyrethroid insecticides that are currently marketed, comparing them to an established standard, carbaryl. Two of the tested insecticides, esfenvalerate and beta-cyfluthrin, did not produce significant mortality compared to the water check. Three active ingredients - permethrin, deltamethrin, and bifenthrin - produced significant mortality when tested at the marketed concentration but failed to provide significant mortality at 0.2X dilution. Carbaryl provided irregular control that was significant in only one of the two experiments. These data suggest that the concentration of the insecticides in these over-the-counter products presently sold at retail seems to be at or near the lower amount where earwigs can be controlled.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,MALARIA JOURNAL,"Background: Recommended vector control tools against malaria, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), mainly target mosquitoes that rest and feed on human hosts indoors. However, in some malaria-endemic areas, such as Southeast Asia and South America, malaria vectors primarily bite outdoors meaning that LLINs and IRS may be less effective. In these situations the use of topical insect repellents may reduce outdoor biting and morbidity from malaria. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of topical insect repellents against malaria. Methods: Studies were identified using database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and clinical trials registers), as well as reference list searches and contact with researchers. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included that assessed the effect of topical repellents (all active ingredients and concentrations) on Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria or infection in malaria-endemic populations. Meta-analysis of clinical data was conducted in order to generate summary risk ratios. Results: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. Studies varied in terms of repellent active ingredient and formulation, co-interventions, study population, compliance, and follow-up period. Topical repellents showed an 18% protective efficacy against P. falciparum malaria, although this was not significant (95% CI: -8%, 38%). Similarly, the average protective efficacy of topical repellents against P. vivax malaria did not reach significance (protective efficacy: 20%, 95% CI: -37%, 53%). Exclusion of non-randomized trials from the meta-analysis did not alter the findings. Conclusions: Although topical repellents can provide individual protection against mosquitoes, the results of this meta-analysis indicate that topical repellents are unlikely to provide effective protection against malaria. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between studies included and the relatively small number of studies meant that this heterogeneity could not be fully explored in the analysis. Further well-designed trials of topical repellents at appropriate doses and alternative modes of repellent delivery, such as spatial repellents and long-lasting insecticide-treated clothing, are required.",2014,13,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-13-446
1533,Cecylia,not vetted,"Peterson, CJ",Longevity of a mixture of acetamiprid and bifenthrin (TransportTM) at the termiticidal application rate,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: The 30 month longevity, mobility and insecticidal activity of a combination of acetamiprid and bifenthrin currently marketed in the United States for the prevention of termite infestation in buildings was investigated in greenhouse and laboratory studies. RESULTS: Acetamiprid dissipated to below the limit of detection within 7 months of application, while bifenthrin remained in the soil at levels sufficient to kill termites for the duration of the study. Acetamiprid was detected in decreasing amounts in eluates of treated soil from months 1 to 4, while no bifenthrin was detected in eluates at any time. The treated soil remained toxic to termites for the 30 month duration of the study. Two indices of synergy between technical-grade acetamiprid and bifenthrin demonstrated that it is unlikely that there would be any synergism between the two active ingredients in the field. The presence of vegetation did not have a significant effect on the longevity of bifenthrin, except at intermediate times, where residues in the treated soil were higher in vegetated plots, depending on depth and time. CONCLUSIONS: Acetamiprid has a short residual time in soil, and this formulation's effectiveness beyond about 7 months against subterranean termites is due to the bifenthrin content.

Excessive use of chemical pesticides to control this pest affects its successful management. In this study, we used a novel technology to improve insecticide efficacy while reducing doses through the combination of insecticides. Therefore, the joint action of pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin (LAM) and neonicotinoid imidacloprid (IMI) was evaluated on the aphid M. persicae using leaf-dipping method. Co-nanoencapsulated formulation of these insecticides was prepared using phosphatidylcholine and chitosan as carrier and surface-coating material, respectively. The results of toxicological studies revealed a considerable synergistic effect at 2:1 ratio of technical grade IMI plus LAM and their co-encapsulated formulation. Nanoparticles produced were spherical with size of 67.56 nm. The LC50 values for the technical grade of IMI, LAM and their mixture were 12.65, 89.82 and 4.07 mg ai l(-1); for co-encapsulated formulation, the value was 7.06 mg ai l(-1). To evaluate the effect of co-nanoencapsulation process on detoxification enzymes, the activities of general esterases and glutathione S-transferases and the amount of cytochrome P450s were measured in M. persicae. The technical grade mixture of IMI and LAM caused pronounced changes in the levels of all tested enzymes compared with the control. In contrast, co-nanoencapsulation protected IMI and LAM from cytochrome P450s- and glutathione S-transferase-induced enzymatic degradation. Considering the toxicological and biochemical findings, co-nanoencapsulation can be valuable as an eco-friendly method for improving the efficacy of the insecticides while preserving the synergistic effects and protecting the active ingredients against detoxification enzymes.",2021,33,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2021.101974

Treatment focuses on the fact that OP compounds inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE): however, AChE-reactivating drugs do not benefit poisoned humans. We therefore studied the role of solvent coformulants in OP toxicity in a novel minipig model of agricultural OP poisoning. Gottingen minipigs were orally poisoned with clinically relevant doses of agricultural emulsifiable concentrate (EC) dimethoate, dimethoate active ingredient (AI) alone, or solvents. Cardiorespiratory physiology and neuromuscular (NMJ) function, blood AChE activity, and arterial lactate concentration were monitored for 12 h to assess poisoning severity. Poisoning with agricultural dimethoate EC40, but not saline, caused respiratory arrest within 30 min, severe distributive shock and NMJ dysfunction, that was similar to human poisoning. Mean arterial lactate rose to 15.6 [SD 2.8] mm in poisoned pigs compared to 1,4[0.4] in controls. Moderate toxicity resulted from poisoning with dimethoate AI alone, or the major solvent cyclohexanone. Combining dimethoate with cyclohexanone reproduced severe poisoning characteristic of agricultural dimethoate EC poisoning. A formulation without cyclohexanone showed less mammalian toxicity. These results indicate that solvents play a crucial role in dimethoate toxicity. Regulatory assessment of pesticide toxicity should include solvents as well as the AIs which currently dominate the assessment. Reformulation of OP insecticides to ensure that the agricultural product has lower mammalian toxicity could result in fewer deaths after suicidal ingestion and rapidly reduce global suicide rates.

Products in 4 of these pairs were applied once to different rectangular areas on the driveway (1 product in each pair to 3 house lots and the other to the remaining 3 house lots). The products in the fifth pair were applied 3 times at 2-mo intervals to vertical stucco walls above the driveway. All house lots received natural and simulated rainfall over 7 mo. Indoor studies showed differences up to 170-fold between paired products, whereas the maximum difference between paired products in the field was only 5-fold. In the pair applied to the wall, 1 product had 91 times the washoff of the other in the indoor study, whereas in the field the same product had 15% lower washoff. These results show that, although the formulation may influence washoff under actual use conditions, its influence is complex and not always as predicted by indoor experiments.

Foliar fungicides were evaluated at various rates and timings for managing blight epidemics over 18 station years from 1998 to 2000. Dry weather in 1998 resulted in low disease pressure, and fungicide application had no effect on blight severity and yield. In 1999 and 2000, wet conditions favored the development of epidemics. Under high disease pressure, a single fungicide application often reduced disease severity, but had no effect on yield. Two applications (early + mid flowering) of chlorothalonil (Bravo((R)) 500) at I kg active ingredients (a.i.)/ha, two applications of azoxystrobin (Quadris((R))) at 125 g a.i./ha, or chlorothalonil + azoxystrobin reduced ascochyta blight and increased yield. An alternative formulation of chlorothalonil, Bravo Ultrex((R)), was less effective than Bravo 500, but more effective than mancozeb (Dithane((R))). Fungicide application had a substantial impact on seed yield; at one site, yield in the untreated control was less than 5% of the best fungicide treatment. Regression analysis showed a strong relationship between disease severity and seed yield. With high disease pressure in 2000, the incidence of seed-borne A. rabiei was 30-48%. Applying azoxystrobin at early + mid flowering reduced it to 7-9%.

Recent reports have questioned its safety, showing that glyphosate may act as an endocrine disruptor by promoting estrogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in this phenomenon remains unclear. Therefore, here we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which glyphosate in-duces estrogenic activity using estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell line models. Our results show that glyphosate mimics the cell effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), promoting estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) phosphorylation, its degra-dation, and transcriptional activity at high concentrations. The molecular mechanism seems involved in the ER alpha ligand-binding domain (LBD). Molecular simulations suggest a plausible interaction between glyphosate and the LBD through a coordinated complex involving divalent cations such as Zn (II). In addition, glyphosate exposure alters the level of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 that contribute to ER alpha phosphorylation. Finally, glyphosate in-creases cell proliferation rate and levels of cell cycle regulators, accompanied by an increase in anchorage -independent growth capacity. These findings suggest that glyphosate at high concentrations, induces estrogen -like effects through an ER alpha ligand binding site-dependent mechanism, leading to cellular responses resulting from a complex interplay of genomic and non-genomic events.",2023,313,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137201

In addition, the sampling sites were grouped based upon the type of water body sampled and environmental concentrations were compared to relevant levels of concern (LOCs) from invertebrates, fish, and amphibians selected from the literature based upon relevant toxicity data. Bifenthrin was the most frequently detected analyte, appearing in 83% of the samples.

However, there is a paucity of data on human dermal exposure to insecticides applied by this method. The objective of the current study was to estimate dermal exposures to the insecticide active ingredient permethrin using water- (Aqua-Reslin (R)) and oil-based (Permanone (R) 30-30) formulations with passive dosimetry. No significant differences in deposition of permethrin were observed between years, distance from the spray source, front or back of the body, or the placement of the patches on the body. However, exposure to Aqua-Reslin was significantly greater than Permanone 30-30 and average concentrations deposited on the body were 4.2 and 2.1 ng/cm(2), respectively. The greater deposition of Aqua-Reslin is most likely due to the higher density of the water-based formulation which causes it to settle out faster than the lighter oil-based formulation of Permanone 30-30. The estimated average absorbed dermal exposure for permethrin from Aqua-Reslin and Permanone 30-30 was 0.00009 and 0.00005 mg/kg body weight, respectively.

Particular challenges of managing flies in different animal systems are discussed for swine, poultry, dairy cattle, beef feedlot, and equine operations. Effective fly management requires diligent monitoring and integration of cultural control, especially manure management, with mechanical control, traps, conservation or augmentative biological control, and judicious use of insecticides. House fly is notorious for developing insecticide resistance and its resistance status is summarized as of August 2020. Several critical research needs are identified. Monitoring systems and nuisance/action thresholds need improvement. Faster-killing strains and better formulations are needed to integrate pathogens into Integrated Pest management (IPM) programs.

The toxicity of pure glyphosate is well known, yet there is little information on the toxicity of glyphosate products, which contain other compounds that may increase or decrease toxicity. Here we studied the effects of different glyphosate-based formulations on the predatory activity of wolf spiders Pardosa against flies. We measured the number of dead flies after direct spider contact with seven commercial glyphosate-based formulations. We found that Roundup (R) Klasik pro affected predatory activity in the short term. For long-term predatory activity, the number of dead flies increased slower in the cases of application of Roundup (R) Klasik pro and Touchdown Quattro (R). Our results support the hypothesis that various pesticide formulations with the same active ingredient have different effects on predators.

A review of environmental chemistry, fate, and toxicology of didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) was conducted. DDAC is used in Canada in antisapstain formulations for treatment of freshly sawn lumber, in disinfectant formulations, and as a molluscicide, DDAC is an active ingredient in the most widely used antisapstain formulation (Kop-Coat NP-I), and one of the most widely used pesticides in British Columbia; 454,400 kg of DDAC were used by lumber mills for antisapstain purposes in 1996. DDAC, a cationic surfactant, is highly water soluble, and binds rapidly to suspended solids and sediments. It is not persistent in the water column; movement to solid phase and microbial degradation are expected to be main routes of dissipation. DDAC was reported to affect rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at levels as low as 0.1 mg L-1, and Daphnia magna at levels as low as 0.03 mg L-1. It is not expected to bioaccumulate.

Both commercially formulated and purified azadirachtin were used in the experiments. The results of adult feeding experiments showed that azadirachtin significantly reduced syrup consumption by worker bees (P < 0.05) and exhibited a dose response in mortality: with an oral LC50 of 10.87 <mu>g/ml in mite-free bees, 13.69 mug/ml in mite-infested bees, and 41.87 mug/ml for associated mites.

Lesser mealworms were collected from four caged-layer poultry farms, three in New York and one in Maine. An additional strain was obtained from an infestation occurring in a cricket colony. RESULTS: In all poultry farm derived strains, a portion of the population (1.8-16.2%) survived cyfluthrin exposure. The Maine and cricket colony strains were tolerant of tetrachlorvinphos exposure as both larvae and adults, with 55-74% mortality, whereas nearly 100% mortality was observed with New York strains. The cricket colony adult beetles were highly susceptible to cyfluthrin, with 100% mortality following exposure, but larvae were considerably less susceptible (87.7%). Pesticide use histories for the poultry farms and their impact on the results are discussed. CONCLUSION: The results document that tetrachlorvinphos, an active ingredient with a long use history, may be losing its effectiveness against lesser mealworms in some poultry operations; however, it is still effective in many others.

Improvement can be interpreted as better weed control better disease control, or reducing the amount of active ingredient required for control. Claims related to the adjuvant function vary from wetter, spreader, and sticker to penetrant and synergist. While most activator adjuvants are applied as 'tank mix' additives, the fatty amine alkoxylates are also suitable as formulation-adjuvants for in-can product developments. During the past decade, Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry has synthesized complex alkoxylates of selected fatty amines for application with relatively hydrophobic pesticides and directed their evaluation as adjuvants for application enhancement of many pesticides in trials conducted around the world. Among those adjuvant trials were applications with systemic and contact fungicides. The application of fatty amine alkoxylates as efficacy-enhancing tank mix adjuvants for triazole fungicides was previously presented [1]. However, there are very little data published regarding the use of this class of surfactants as activator adjuvants with the newer strobilurin fungicides.

If a worst-case estimate of pesticide exposure is below a very conservative effects metric (e.g., the no observed effects concentration of the most sensitive tested surrogate species) then the potential risks are considered de minimis and unlikely to jeopardize the existence of a threatened or endangered species. Thus by design, such compounded layers of conservatism are intended to minimize potential Type II errors (failure to reject a false null hypothesis of de minimus risk), but correspondingly increase Type I errors (falsely reject a null hypothesis of de minimus risk). Because of the conservatism inherent in screening-level risk assessments, higher-tier scientific information and analyses that provide additional environmental realism can be applied in cases where a potential risk has been identified. This information includes community-level effects data, environmental fate and exposure data, monitoring data, geospatial location and proximity data, species biology data, and probabilistic exposure and population models. Given that the definition of risk includes likelihood and magnitude of effect, higher-tier risk assessments should use probabilistic techniques that more accurately and realistically characterize risk. Moreover, where possible and appropriate, risk assessments should focus on effects at the population and community levels of organization rather than the more traditional focus on the organism level. This document provides a review of some types of higher-tier data and assessment refinements available to more accurately and realistically evaluate potential risks of pesticide use to threatened and endangered species.

Whilst the major focus to date has been on managing exposure to the active ingredient glyphosate, it is now recognised that a common major 'inert' surfactant ingredient, polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) and related compounds, may be more toxic. However, the information on the toxicokinetics of POEA surfactants after exposure is limited, in part, due to the lack of suitable methods for their analysis in biological matrices. We therefore developed and validated a robust LC-MSMS method that allowed, for the first time, a rapid analysis of 11 POEA homologues in human plasma. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Kinetex EVO C18 column under a 5 min gradient elution with mobile phase A containing water/acetonitrile/formic acid (95:5:0.1, v/v/v) and mobile phase B containing acetonitrile/water/formic acid (95:5:0.1, v/v/v). Amlodipine was chosen as the internal standard (IS) for this assay. Amlodipine-d4 would be an ideal alternative IS to expand the applicability of the established method especially in antihypertensive patients. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) methods were optimized for 11 POEA homologues and the IS. Sample pre-treatment was performed using simple protein precipitation with methanol at a ratio of 4:1, requiring only 20 mu L plasma. The validated method showed good specificity, accuracy and precision with lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) ranging from 0.35 to 10.8 ng mL-1 for all selected POEA homologues. The method was then used to measure concentrations of the various POEA surfactants in more than 600 human plasma samples from 151 patients admitted to hospital with acute glyphosate intoxication. The highest concentrations ranged from 1.07 ng mL-1 for C18u(EO)4-362.70 ng mL-1 for C16s(EO)2.

With broad beans, similar growth stimulation was obtained with the blank at the same or half dose, but not at a quarter dose. Testing the four formulation components separately showed that only the non-ionic emulsifier caused stimulation A comparison of the stimulation of plant growth by the blank and the non-ionic emulsifier showed that plant height, shoot fresh weight, leaf fresh weight, leaf dry weight and leaf area were each equally increased by both treatments. The non-ionic emulsifier thus accounted for the entire stimulation caused by blank solution. Populations of Aphis fabae Scopoli (Homoptera: Aphididae) were twice as high on broad bean plants sprayed with the non-ionic emulsifier as on the controls. 'Cymbush' (the complete formulation) sprayed at 25 ppm a.i. was shown to increase the intrinsic rate of natural increase of the aphid through a 22% increase in fecundity; aphid development time was not affected. The results do, however, suggest that residual effects of cypermethrin may have partly counteracted the stimulatory effects of the non-ionic emulsifier.

Efficacy on target pests and market price of the pesticide products to be used were the most important criteria for selection of pesticides, i.e. products that are considered to be highly effective and/or that are cheap are more likely to be selected. Better-educated and more experienced farmers were found to pay more attention to environmental safety and pesticide toxicity. Most farmers felt that pesticide use can reduce crop damage by more than 75%, assuring high yields.

Total formulation efficacy can be expressed as a function of [deposition:retention:uptake: translocation:a.i. toxicity]. Adjuvants influence the physico-chemical and plant interactions involved for each factor. Deposition efficiency of spray droplets on to a target is dependent largely on the droplet spectrum, whereas retention performance is dependent on plant leaf surface character, orientation and canopy architecture, as well as droplet volume, velocity and dynamic surface tension effects. Uptake into plant foliage is affected by the leaf surface wax, cuticle age and composition and species variability. Uptake can be improved through appropriate formulation to provide either stomatal infiltration or much greater and faster cuticular absorption of the active ingredient. The inherent translocation capability of the a.i. is not affected directly by adjuvants, which are relatively immobile, but they can increase the mass of absorbed a.i. translocated, as a consequence of improved uptake or may reduce it as a result of localized contact phytotoxicity. Considerable progress has been made in developing models of spray droplet deposition, adhesion and retention, as well as uptake.

The procedure developed reduces organic solvent consumption, per sample preparation, from 51 ml CH3CN required for HPLC to 2.5 ml CHCI3, and reduces waste generation also increasing the sample measurement frequency, from 3 to 30 samples/h, as compared with the HPLC-UV reference method.

Current bait products use one of the few available benzoylurea chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) labeled for subterranean termites. These insecticides are used because of their nonrepellency, their slow-acting mode of action, and their dose-independent lethal time. Although many studies have provided ample evidence of the efficacy of CSI baits for subterranean termite colony elimination, most have focused on hexaflumuron and noviflumuron. However, bait products using alternative CSIs have not received the same level of scrutiny, limiting the amount of evidence proving their efficacy. One such compound is novaluron, the active ingredient currently used in the Trelona ATBS-AdvanceTermite Baiting System bait product. The current study independently tested the efficacy of this commercially available bait formulation against whole colonies of Coptotermes gestroi (Wamann) (similar to 63,910 workers) in the laboratory, using an extended experimental setup to simulate a 15-m foraging distance from the central part of the nest to the bait, while having access to alternative food sources. Treated colonies progressively ceased to feed on wood items within 45 d after being provided access to the novaluron bait formulation, with a subsequent progressive collapse of the population, leading to colony elimination by 91 d. This study therefore confirms the efficacy of novaluron baits against subterranean termites, and currently remains one of the few CSIs that can be applied for the successful control of Coptotermes infestations.",2021,114,1249,1255,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toab061

No lice were found on any of the treated sheep despite careful inspection of at least 40 fleece partings per animal at 2, 6, 12 and 20 weeks after treatment. In the untreated sheep louse numbers increased from a mean (+/- SE) of 2.4 (+/- 0.7) per 10 cm fleece part at 2 weeks to 12.3 (+/- 4.2) per part at 20 weeks. Treatment of sheep with 6 months wool by jetting (high pressure spraying into the fleece) reduced louse numbers by 94% in comparison to controls at two weeks after treatment with both 1% and 2% TTO formulations.

The particular choice of LVP fluid and its concentration may also affect the biological performance of insecticide formulations. To demonstrate these effects, a variety of hydrocarbon LVP carrier fluids were combined with the insecticides S-bioallethrin(5) and deltamethrin(6) in both solvent and water-based insecticide formulations. Experiments were conducted to evaluate knockdown and residual activity against German cockroaches. Data indicated that use of hydrocarbon LVP carrier fluids with higher levels of normal paraffins resulted in faster knockdown of the cockroaches under a variety of test conditions. Higher concentrations of hydrocarbon LVP carrier fluids in water-based formulations also enhanced their knockdown performance. The residual activities of water-based formulations, inferred from the lengths of time the formulations remained efficacious after they were applied to ceramic tile and painted plywood, were adversely affected by higher concentrations of normal paraffins or LVP hydrocarbons. The results suggest that normal paraffins and higher concentrations of LVP hydrocarbon fluids may increase the penetration of the formulations into insect and household surfaces. With the insects this leads to faster intake of insecticide. With the household surfaces this reduces insecticide availability. One can use this information to select active ingredients, LVP fluids, and their concentrations, along with other formulants, to optimize formulation performance for specific application requirements and meet VOC regulations. Of the LVP hydrocarbon fluids tested, a mixed aliphatic fluid with a moderate concentration (20% w/w) of normal paraffins appeared to offer the best balance of properties for use in crawling insect killers.",2001,1414,90,98,http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP10720S

However, a number of commercially available formulations have been shown to enhance the transdermal penetration of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Most of the active ingredients used in these compounds can individually act as penetration enhancers. Commercial sunscreens frequently contain multiple active ingredients in order to provide broad sunscreen protection. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the effect of these active ingredient combinations on the transdermal absorption of 2,4-D in vitro. All six of the combinations tested resulted in increased cumulative penetration (P< 0.01) and faster lag times ( P< 0.05). The 2,4-D cumulative penetration in the presence of the OFF! Deepwoods combination was significantly greater than the absorption with either the individual ingredients or their average ( P< 0.05). A systematic study designed to isolate the chemicals responsible for this enhancement demonstrated that with UV absorbers DEET synergistically increased the 2,4-D penetration and that DEET's cumulative enhancement properties correlate with its concentration. By contrast, octocrylene significantly slowed the lag time when used in combinations and was the only active ingredient that showed any antagonistic effects on 2,4-D penetration. Because none of the active ingredient combinations were able to inhibit dermal uptake of 2,4-D, it seems that proper selection of inert ingredients may be the most feasible solution for reducing penetration enhancement.",2003,19,1,8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0748233703th172oa

One common active ingredient used in commercial herbicide formulations in Midwestern states is 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Due to the stability of 2,4-D in aquatic environments, many non-target aquatic species experience prolonged exposure throughout critical developmental life stages that can affect essential behaviors. However, the impacts of 2,4-D exposure on learning behaviors in juvenile fish are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments using a maze environment to determine the effects of a commercial 2,4-D amine salt herbicide formulation (Weedestroy (R) AM40; WAM40; at 0.00, 0.50, 2.00, and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D acid equivalent (a.e.)) exposure on juvenile yellow perch's ability to perform a feed associated learning behavior. We observed a significant decrease in the ability of yellow perch to correctly complete the feed associated learning behavior within 200 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.00 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to controls (p = 0.0002; p < 0.0001, respectively) and within 600 s when exposed to WAM40 at 2.00 and 50.0 mg/L 2,4-D as compared to the controls (p = 0.0107 and p 0.0001). These data suggest that exposure to 2,4-D in WAM40 can both increase the amount of time it takes for yellow perch to complete a feed associated learning behavior and/or obstruct the behavior altogether. Further experiments showed no significant decreases in locomotion (p 0.05), hunger motivation (p > 0.05), and a visually guided startle response (p > 0.05), in all treatment groups tested as compared to controls. This suggests that 2,4-D in WAM40 does not inhibit feed associated learning behaviors via interaction with these mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate that the use of 2,4-D herbicides for weed control in aquatic ecosystems could present risks to cognitive functions that control essential behaviors of yellow perch.",2021,237,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.105909

Molecular weights of salts ranged from 111 g mol(-1) to 755 g mo(-1). Penetration in light at 20 degrees C and 100% humidity was a first order process and rate constants of penetration ranged from 0.39 h(-1)(CaCl2) to 0.058 h(-1)supercript stop (Ca-lactobionate). Penetration was a first order process in the dark as well, but the rate constants were smaller by a factor of 1.82. Plotting logarithmatised rate constants versus anhydrous molecular weights resulted in straight lines both in light and in the dark. The slopes per hour were very similar and the average slope was -1.2x10(-3) mol g(-1). Hence, size selectivity was not affected by stomatal opening, and in light or darkness permeability of Vicia cuticles decreased by a factor of 2.9 when molecular weight increased from 100 g mol(-1) to 500 g mol(-1).

The size selectivity of aqueous pores in Vicia leaf cuticles is small compared to that observed in poplar leaf cuticles, in which permeability decreased by a factor of 7-13 for the same range of molecular weights. It is also much smaller than size selectivity of the lipophilic pathway in cuticles.

In this regard, we studied the herbicidal activity of a series of substituted cyclic ketals, their derivatives and alkenylmalonates. On the basis of commercially available triols the corresponding cyclic ketals were obtained with a yield more than 90%. O-alkylation of alcohol according to the methods led to the corresponding ethers and esters. The glycerol monoethers were obtained quantitatively by acid hydrolysis of ketals. Growth-regulatory activity of the synthesized compounds was determined in vitro on wheat and pea seedlings according to a known procedure (aromatic solvent - nefras A 150/330, surfactant - oxyethylated izononilfenol neonol AF-9-12). Evaluation of herbicidal activity of preparations was carried out in the laboratory. During 3 days length (L, mm) and weight (m, g) seedlings in comparison with the control option was measured. Without herbicide on seedlings the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants are placed in Petri dishes containing water emulsion of active substances with a concentration of 5 mg / l and 10 mg /l for peas and 50 mg / l and 100 mg / l for wheat. As a reference well-known herbicide, Oktapon Extra, was used. The diol with allyloxydiol group showed the best results towards wheat. This compound successfully inhibits the increase in the length and weight of escape and gives close results to the standard. For peas, ketals and derivatives thereof are effective only in terms of inhibition of the shoot masses. Heterocyclic alcohol and glycols are superior to the standard, and a ketal at a concentration of 10 mg / l practically corresponds to it. Alkenylmalonates were more effective in inhibiting the escape weight wheat than peas. In particular, at a concentration of 100mg / l effectiveness of methallyl derivatives of trans-1,3-dichloropropene coincides to the standard. Physical and chemical characteristics of the compounds were proved by NMR and mass spectra. Screening results showed that activity of diol with allyloxy group is close to the ideal attitude to wheat. Ketals and their derivatives show the herbicidal activity only at inhibition of the mass escape of peas. Results of alkenylmalonates were better at inhibition of the mass escape of wheat than peas.

The organobentonites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and the adsorption towards pretilachlor was investigated, to reveal the structural effects of organobentonites on the release of pretilachlor. Organobentonites with quaternary alkylammonium surfactant showed excellent adsorption capacity for pretilachlor and greatly reduced its release in water. On the basis of the parameter of an empirical equation used to fit the release data, the release of pretilachlor from organobentonites could be deduced to be predominated by Fickian diffusion mechanism. The time taken for 50% of active ingredient to be released, T-50, from DTMA-bentonite with surfactant loading of 60, 80, 100 and 120% of the cation exchange capacity was 12.9, 12.7, 185 and 26.7 times of that for the formulation without organobentonites and exhibited good linear relationship with the adsorption constant K-f from the Freundlich equation. Similar results were obtained for HTMA-bentonite. Hydrophobic interaction played a key roll in the adsorption and sustained release of pretilachlor. An increasing loading level of quaternary alkylammonium surfactant on organobentonites generally led to an enhancement of the sustained release. The permeability of organobentonite also had an important impact on the diffusion of the herbicide. The extension of the alkyl chain of the quaternary ammonium surfactant resulted in an increased permeability of organobentonites and release of pretilachlor, owing to the increased basal spacing and lower surfactant packing density.

To evaluate the effects of Glyph on the nervous system, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given six intraperitoneal injections of 50, 100, or 150 mg Glyph/kg BW over 2 weeks (three injections/week). We assessed dopaminergic markers and their association with locomotor activity. Repeated exposure to Glyph caused hypoactivity immediately after each injection, and it was also apparent 2 days after the last injection in rats exposed to the highest dose. Glyph did not decrease monoamines, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), or mesencephalic TH+ cells when measured 2 or 16 days after the last Glyph injection. In contrast, Glyph decreased specific binding to D1 dopamine (DA) receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) when measured 2 days after the last Glyph injection. Microdialysis experiments showed that a systemic injection of 150 mg Glyph/kg BW decreased basal extracellular DA levels and high-potassium-induced DA release in striatum. Glyph did not affect the extracellular concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or homovanillic acid. These results indicate that repeated Glyph exposure results in hypoactivity accompanied by decreases in specific binding to D1-DA receptors in the NAcc, and that acute exposure to Glyph has evident effects on striatal DA levels. Additional experiments are necessary in order to unveil the specific targets of Glyph on dopaminergic system, and whether Glyph could be affecting other neurotransmitter systems involved in motor control.

While comparing the sensitivity of the acute (30 min) Microtox (R) standard assay with the chronic (25 h) test adapted to microtiter plate, joint effects (antagonism, additive effect and synergism) to the bioluminescence inhibition (consequently the metabolic damage) in A. fischeri were also determined by Combination Index (CI) method. 30 min of exposure to mesotrione and S-metolachlor resulted in a relatively low acute toxicity (EC50 values were 118 and 265 mg/L), while terbuthylazine did not cause bioluminescence inhibition at all. Results showed that the chronic toxicity of S-metolachlor and terbuthylazine to A. fischeri (EC5010h = 59.2 and 4.9 mg/L and EC5015h = 54.0 and 9.6 mg/L, respectively) is larger by at least one order of magnitude than that after 30 min of contact time. Considering mesotrione no significant difference was experienced in toxicity. Regarding the EC50 values, all of the mixtures had synergistic joint effects in the acute assay. However, in the chronic test all the mixtures showed antagonistic responses with the exception of mesotrione and S-metolachlor (ratio 1:1) combination, which also had additive and synergistic effects after 10 and 15 h of exposure, similarly to the short-term test. This is also the first report of the joint effects of these herbicides.

Historically, fatty methyl esters have been used to increase solubility, improve stability, and increase flash points in some high active pesticide formulations. In an attempt to investigate solvent alternatives in emulsifiable concentrate formulations, fatty methyl esters were examined under laboratory conditions with a cross section of typical fatty methyl esters. Emulsifiable concentrates consisting of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, trifluralin, and malathion were used in this study. Fatty methyl esters ranging in carbon chain lengths C-4-C-18 were evaluated as replacements for C-10 alkylbenzene solvent (aromatic solvent) in the emulsifiable concentrate formulations.

GLY is applied in formulated products known as glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), which could induce effects that are not predicted by toxicity assays with pure GLY. This herbicide is classified as organophosphorus compound, which is known to induce neurotoxic effects. Although this compound is classified as non-neurotoxic by regulatory agencies, acute exposure to GBH causes neurological symptoms in humans. However, there is no consensus in relation to neurotoxic effects of GBH. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the neurotoxic effects of the GBH in the zebrafish Danio rerio, focusing on acute toxicity, the activity and transcript levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive species (RS) formation, and behavioral repertoire. Adult zebrafish were exposed in vivo to three concentrations of GBH Scout (R), which contained GLY in formulation (fGLY) (0.065,1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 fGLY) for 7 d, and an in vitro assay was performed using also pure GLY. Our results show that GBH induced in zebrafish brain a decrease in cell viability, inhibited mitochondrial complex enzymatic activity, modulated gene expression related to mitochondrial complexes, induced an increase in RS production, promoted hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane, and induced behavioral impairments. Together, our data contributes to the knowledge of the neurotoxic effects of GBH. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a relevant cellular response that should not be disregarded. Moreover, this study pointed to the mitochondria as an important target of GBH. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018,209,353,362,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.06.075

Adulteration of pesticides can occur in several stages of manufacturing the active ingredient (AI) when using poor raw materials and low-quality solvents to produce either the AI or the formulation by avoiding required purification procedures, leading to impurities in the form of stereoisomers (cis or trans). Also, counterfeit pesticide producers can use low-cost materials in manufacturing packaging materials, among other methods of adulteration. Impurities in counterfeit pesticides, such as ethylmethanesulfonate, isomalathion, or non-ylphenol ethoxylates, could threaten human health, environmental components, and national economies. Elaborate tests are necessary to distinguish between original and counterfeit pesticides. Organized crime trades in counterfeit pesticides, driven by their great profits. Global revenues from counterfeit pesticide trade are estimated at more than (sic)4.4 billion (US$5.4 billion) annually.

In this work, the droplet size distribution, rheology and physical stability of nanoemulsions with improved properties containing rosemary essential oil and biopolymers as a function of the concentration of these polysaccharides were investigated. RESULTS Mean diameters below 150 nm were achieved, indicating nanostructures were obtained. Regardless of gum type, a gel-like structure and a shear thinning behaviour was achieved. In addition, an increase of G ', G '' and viscosity and a decrease of J(0), J(1), J(2), lambda(1) and lambda(2) with increasing gum concentration were observed, due to the formation of a three-dimensional network in the aqueous phase. Slight differences between nanoemulsions containing welan or xanthan were found. Creaming, depletion flocculation and gel aggregation were the main destabilization processes at low, intermediate and high gum concentration, respectively.

Research has shown that glyphosate and Roundup can induce a broad range of biological effects in exposed organisms, particularly via generation of oxidative stress. However, there has been no comprehensive investigation of the global molecular mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate and Roundup for any species. We aimed to characterise and compare the global mechanisms of toxicity of glyphosate and Roundup in the liver of brown trout (Salmo trutta), an ecologically and economically important vertebrate species, using RNA-seq on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. To do this, we exposed juvenile female brown trout to 0, 0.01, 0.5 and 10 mg/L of glyphosate and Roundup (glyphosate acid equivalent) for 14 days, and sequenced 6 replicate liver samples from each treatment. Results: We assembled the brown trout transcriptome using an optimised de novo approach, and subsequent differential expression analysis identified a total of 1020 differentially-regulated transcripts across all treatments. These included transcripts encoding components of the antioxidant system, a number of stress-response proteins and pro-apoptotic signalling molecules. Functional analysis also revealed over-representation of pathways involved in regulating of cell-proliferation and turnover, and up-regulation of energy metabolism and other metabolic processes. Conclusions: These transcriptional changes are consistent with generation of oxidative stress and the widespread induction of compensatory cellular stress response pathways. The mechanisms of toxicity identified were similar across both glyphosate and Roundup treatments, including for environmentally relevant concentrations. The significant alterations in transcript expression observed at the lowest concentrations tested raises concerns for the potential toxicity of this herbicide to fish populations inhabiting contaminated rivers.",2015,16,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-015-1254-5

The study was conducted in outdoor mesocosm systems (860 to 7000 L tanks) at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Waterways Experiment Station, Lewisville Aquatic Ecosystem Research Facility (LAERF) in Texas. The selectivity evaluations of submersed species were conducted in mesocosm tanks, and treatment rates included 0, 1, 2, and 5 mg/L active ingredient (ai) endothall with a 24 hour water flow-through half-life. Emergent species treatment rates included 0, 1, 2 and 5 mg/L ai endothall and a static water-flow exposure period of 120 hours. Floating-leaf treatment rates included 0, 1, 2, and 5 mg/L ai endothall and a static waterflow exposure period of 120 hours. Endothall was effective at controlling hydrilla at the 2 and 5 mg/L application rates, reducing the biomass by more than 90%, 6 weeks after treatment (WAT), with no regrowth observed. Wild celery and Illinois pondweed biomass were also significantly reduced following the endothall application at 1, 2 and 5 mg/L, but healthy, regrowth was observed by 6 WAT. American pondweed and southern naiad biomass was significantly reduced by more than 90% by 6 WAT, and no regrowth was measured. Watershield and water stargrass showed no effects from endothall application at 1, 2, and 5 mg/L, and growth was actually enhanced by reduced competition from invading annual species. Soft-stemmed bulrush also showed no effects from treatment with endothall. Biomass of arrowhead, spatterdock, and fragrant waterlily was significantly reduced at the 2 mg/L application rate, and plants were controlled at the 5 mg/L application rate. Because the emergent and floating-leaf evaluations were conducted under static water-flow conditions, these evaluations represented a worst case scenario, which may not be indicative of endothall use patterns under field conditions.

Measurements of sensitivities of target and non-target species to hydrogen peroxide are necessary for water resource managers to make informed decisions and minimize risks for non-target species when treating noxious algae. The objective of this study was to measure and compare responses among a target noxious alga (cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa) and non-target organisms including a eukaryotic alga (chlorophyte Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata), microcrustacean (Ceriodaphnia dubia), benthic amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) to exposures of hydrogen peroxide as SCR Hydrogen peroxide exposures were confirmed using the I-3 - method. SCP margins of safety for these organisms were compared with published toxicity data to provide context for other commonly used algaecides and herbicides (e.g. copper formulations, endothall, and diquat dibromide). Algal responses (cell density and chlorophyll a concentrations) and animal mortality were measured after 96 h aqueous exposures to SCP in laboratory-formulated water to estimate EC50 and LC50 values, as well as potency slopes. Despite a shorter test duration, M. aeruginosa was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide as SCP (96 h EC50:0.9-1.0 mg L-1 H2O2) than the eukaryotic alga P. subcapitata (7-d EC50:5.2-9.2 mg L-1 H2O2), indicating potential for selective control of prokaryotic algae. For the three non-target animals evaluated, measured 96-h LC50 values ranged from 1.0 to 19.7 mg L-1 H2O2. C dubia was the most sensitive species, and the least sensitive species was P. promelas, which is not likely to be affected by concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as SCP that would be used to control noxious algae (e.g. M. aeruginosa). Based on information from peer-reviewed literature, other algaecides could be similarly selective for cyanobacteria. Of the algaecides compared, SCP can selectively mitigate risks associated with noxious cyanobacterial growths (e.g. M. aeruginosa), with an enhanced margin of safety for non-target species (e.g. P. promelas).

We are still using the same two antidotes - atropine and oximes - that first came into clinical use in the late 1950s. Clinical research in South Asia has shown how improved regimens of atropine can prevent deaths. However, we are still unsure about which patients are most likely to benefit from the use of oximes. Supplemental antidotes, such as magnesium, clonidine and sodium bicarbonate, have all been proposed and studied in small trials without production of definitive answers. Novel antidotes such as nicotinic receptor antagonists, beta-adrenergic agonists and lipid emulsions are being studied in large animal models and in pilot clinical trials. Hopefully, one or more of these affordable and already licensed antidotes will find their place in routine clinical care. However, the large number of chemically diverse OP insecticides, the varied poisoning they produce and their varied response to treatment might ultimately make it difficult to determine definitively whether these antidotes are truly effective. In addition, the toxicity of the varied solvents and surfactants formulated with the OP active ingredients complicates both treatment and studies. It is possible that the only effective way to reduce deaths from OP insecticide poisoning will be a steady reduction in their agricultural use worldwide.",2016,81,462,470,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bcp.12784

Effective mitigation requires better understanding and prediction of off-site transport processes. Presented here is a comprehensive study on pesticide washoff from concrete surfaces, including washoff tests, experimental data analysis, model development, and application. Controlled rainfall experiments were conducted to characterize washoff loads of commercially formulated insecticides with eight different active ingredients. On the basis of the analysis of experimental results, a semimechanistic model was developed to predict pesticide buildup and washoff processes on concrete surfaces. Three pesticide product specific parameters and their time dependences were introduced with empirical functions to simulate the persistence, transferability, and exponential characteristics of the pesticide washoff mechanism. The parameters were incorporated using first-order kinetics and Fick's second law to describe pesticide buildup and washoff processes, respectively. The model was applied to data from 21 data sets collected during 38 rainfall events, with parameters calibrated to pesticide products and environmental conditions. The model satisfactorily captured pesticide mass loads and their temporal variations for pesticides with a wide range of chemical properties (log K-OW = 0.6-6.9) under both single and repeated (1-7 times) rainfall events after varying set times (1.5 h similar to 238 days after application). Results of this study suggested that, in addition to commonly reported physicochemical properties for the active ingredient of a pesticide product, additional parameters determined from washoff experiments are required for risk assessments of pesticide applications on urban impervious surfaces.",2014,48,234,243,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es4028343

Our encapsulated formulation reduces the volatility of the active ingredient when it is applied to the soil surface in a typical agricultural spray use. The commercialized formulation was selected from among hundreds of encapsulated formulations for its ability to reliably control volatility. Many of the rejected formulations did not control volatility, and it was only through a careful optimization of the encapsulation process that we came to our selection. As part of our formulation development process, we developed a laboratory volatility assessment method for use in screening formulations. This method determined the volatility following a soil application and normalized the volatility of the encapsulated formulations to that of the older Command 4EC herbicide formulation. Our optimized formulation was introduced to the market in 1996 to control volatility. A sample of the first production batch of commercial clomazone 3CS formulation, which had been stored at room temperature and regularly assessed for ten years, continues to provide excellent control of volatility. This indicates that the capsules have remained intact and functional, and that the proportion of clomazone in the capsule, versus outside, has not changed as the formulation aged. When these capsules are diluted in water, some clomazone slowly diffuses out of the capsules. This release is limited by the water solubility of clomazone. Even for excessive residence times in the spray tank, the volatility from the soil surface increased only slightly and was well within the acceptable range, for dilutions used for agricultural spray application. Improper addition of solvents and surfactants to the formulation can provide a phase where the clomazone is soluble, and this solubility will extract clomazone from the capsules. Under these conditions the volatility of the product increased so that it was similar to an unencapsulated formulation. In contrast, addition of other herbicides or spray additives to the spray tank mix had little impact on the volatility.",2008,1500,17,26,http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP47502S

The NNA and APTES conjugate was prepared through a covalent cross-linking reaction and subsequent hydrolyzation and polycondensation to synthesize NNA-silica nanospheres. The release data indicated that the release of NNA was by non-Fickian transport and increased as particle size decreased. It was also found that the acidity-alkalinity was enhanced and as the temperature increased, the release of the active ingredient was faster.

The acetochlor nanocapsules were characterised by size distribution, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and factors related to loading efficiency, swelling behaviour of the formulation were investigated. For this controlled-release formulation, the loading efficiency could reach about 50% (w/w). n, the diffusion parameter was indicative of the transport mechanism, and the values for 'n' were in the range of 0.28-0.61, which indicated that the release of acetochlor was diffusion-controlled. The time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, t(50), was also calculated for the comparison of formulations in different conditions. The formulation with higher temperature and more diacetone acrylamide had lower value of t(50), which means a quicker release of the active ingredient. This study highlighted some pieces of evidence that improved herbicide incorporation and slower release were linked to potential interactions between the herbicide and the polymer.",2014,94,1001,1012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2014.930844

Three formulations were examined: (1) a single component active ingredient in an 85% dry flowable, (2) dry flowable formulation in combination of pyroxasulfone + flumioxazin, and (3) a liquid SC formulation of pyroxasulfone + carfentrazone. The liquid formulation is a suspo-emulsion. When averaged across the three studies, the DT 50 were 34.4, 30.2 and 29.9 d for pyroxasulfone plus carfentrazone, pyroxasulfone, and pyroxasulfone plus flumioxazin, respectively. These trends would indicate that formulation had little or no effect on pyroxasulfone dissipation in this experiment. Pyroxasulfone DT 50 in all studies ranged from a low of 15.4 d to a high of 53.3 d, and loss was more rapid under warm, moist conditions.

All acaricides resulted in 100% mite mortality. Two groups of active ingredients could be differentiated. The products Silicosec(R)and Ewazid(R), based on naturally occurring diatomaceous earth (DE), killed 100% of adultD. gallinaewithin 48 h exposure time. The time to kill 50% of the mites (LT50) was calculated to be 31.7 and 34.9 h, respectively. The other two products, containing aggregates and agglomerates of pyrogenic synthetic amorphous silicon dioxide as active ingredients, killed the mites in a significantly shorter time: LT(50)was 6.3 h for the liquid product Fossil Shield(R)Instant White and 11.8 h for the powdery product Fossil Shield 90.0 White. This is more remarkable as the quantities of active ingredients used for the DE treatments were several folds higher. The effectiveness of all tested products was also shown in practical tests. A professional company treated five chicken houses on one farm in the Berlin-Brandenburg region with the test products, three houses with Fossil Shield Instant White and one each with Ewazid and Silicosec. Over a period of 46 weeks after stocking, the mite development in the houses was assessed. Only in one of the houses, treated with Fossil Shield Instant White, the mite population remained permanently low. In two houses treated with Fossil Shield Instant White, small mite colonies appeared in week 36, which were controlled by a follow-up spot treatment in week 41. In the houses treated with DE, the first mite colonies appeared 12 weeks after stocking. The number increased continuously over the experimental period and in week 31 after stocking there were clearly visible colonies (2-3 cm diameter) and the first mites could also be detected on the chicken eggs. At this time both houses were treated again with a follow-up spot-treatment, which only led to a slight improvement in one house and to a stabilization of the infestation in the other house. In week 41, large mite colonies were detected in both houses. A spot treatment at this point was ineffective in reducing the infestation. The tests showed faster acaricidal action of the products with the synthetic active ingredients compared to the natural DE-based products. This matches the shorter killing times under laboratory conditions. The experiments in a commercial chicken farm showed that it is possible to control the mite population for a period of 46 weeks by using physically effective SiO2-based products.

A sustainable, alternative weed control strategy is developed using salicylaldehyde (SA; 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde) as an active ingredient. SA is a natural, redox-active small molecule listed as a Generally Recognized As Safe food additive by the European Food Safety Authority and the United States Food and Drug Administration. The repurposing of SA determined that SA possesses both pre- and post-emergent herbicidal, fumigant activity, where the emitted SA from the source completely prevented the germination of plant seeds and/or the growth of the germinated plants. As a proof-of-concept, we developed agricultural byproducts (tree nutshell particles) as SA delivery vehicles to the soil, thus helping the growers' sustainable byproduct recycling program, necessary for carbon sequestration. In plate assays, SA emitted from the nutshell vehicles (0.15 to 1.6 M) completely prevented the germination of six invasive or native weed seeds (monocots, dicots). In Magenta vessel assays, SA emitted from the nutshell vehicles (0.8 to 1.6 M) not only prevented the germination (pre-emergent) of Lagurus ovatus (Bunny Tails Grass) seeds but also inhibited the growth (post-emergent) of the germinated weeds. We determined further that soil covering (soil pasteurization) could be one of the practices to effectively deliver SA to the soil, whereby 1.6 M of SA emitted from the nutshell vehicles prevented the germination of the L. ovatus seeds maintained in soil trays covered with plastic tarp at 22 degrees C, while 0.8 M SA allowed partial (15%) germination of the weed seeds. Of note, SA also possesses an intrinsic antifungal activity that overcomes the tolerance of the stress signaling mutants of filamentous fungal pathogens (Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium expansum) to the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil. Environmental degradation data available in the public database indicate that, once released to the environment, SA will be broken down in the air by sunlight or microorganisms and, thus, is not built up in aquatic organisms. Altogether, SA can serve as a safe, potent pesticide (herbicidal, fungicidal) ingredient that promotes sustainable crop production by lowering the pesticide burden in fields.",2022,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12083749

However, while PPF may be delivered to oviposition locations by the mosquito vehicles, these treated mosquitoes may also be delivering PPF to nectar sources that other insects may visit, in particular important insect pollinators. Here we have examined for the direct transfer of PPF to nectar sources and the indirect transfer to the European honey bee. We show PPF is being deposited on artificial nectar sources and is being indirectly transferred to European honey bees. The results are discussed in reference to the potential risks to important insect pollinators of using autodissemination approaches for mosquito control.</p> The frequency of arboviral disease epidemics is increasing and vector control remains the primary mechanism to limit arboviral transmission. Container inhabiting mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti are the primary vectors of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Current vector control methods for these species are often ineffective, suggesting the need for novel control approaches. A proposed novel approach is autodissemination of insect growth regulators (IGRs). The advantage of autodissemination approaches is small amounts of active ingredients compared to traditional insecticide applications are used to impact mosquito populations. While the direct targeting of cryptic locations via autodissemination seems like a significant advantage over large scale applications of insecticides, this approach could actually affect nontarget organisms by delivering these highly potent long lasting growth inhibitors such as pyriproxyfen (PPF) to the exact locations that other beneficial insects visit, such as a nectar source. Here we tested the hypothesis that PPF treated male Ae. albopictus will contaminate nectar sources, which results in the indirect transfer of PPF to European honey bees (Apis mellifera). We performed bioassays, fluorescent imaging, and mass spectrometry on insect and artificial nectar source materials to examine for intra- and interspecific transfer of PPF. Data suggests there is direct transfer of PPF from Ae. albopictus PPF treated males and indirect transfer of PPF to A. mellifera from artificial nectar sources. In addition, we show a reduction in fecundity in Ae. albopictus and Drosophila melanogaster when exposed to sublethal doses of PPF. The observed transfer of PPF to A. mellifera suggests the need for further investigation of autodissemination approaches in a more field like setting to examine for risks to insect pollinators.</p>",2021,15,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009824

It also provides comparative data to that obtained from previous surveys in 1981 (Jess & Marks 1986), 1988 (Foy et al. 1995) and 1997 (Jess et al. 2000). The total number of sheep farms in Northern Ireland decreased by 25% to 8822 farms with a consequent 26% reduction in total sheep population to 2.1 million sheep compared with the previous survey in 1997. During this period, the number of sheep treated for ectoparasites decreased by 40%. The total quantity of organophosphorus (OP) compounds used for ectoparasite control decreased by approximately 67%, from 7.8 tonnes in 1997 to 2.6 tonnes in 2005, during which an estimated 0.38 of all sheep treated for ectoparasites received the OP active ingredient diazinon. The survey results indicate a decline in the practice of plunge-dipping sheep for ectoparasite control with the proportion of farms using this treatment method decreasing from 0.58 to 0.16 between 1997 and 2005. In 1997, an estimated 0.8 of all sheep treated for ectoparasites in Northern Ireland were plunge-dipped, which reduced significantly to 0.28 during 2005. Conversely, the use of alternative methods has increased with pour-on formulations of insecticides, macrocyclic lactones and growth regulators being applied to 0.33 of all sheep treated in 2005 compared with 0.09 in 1997. Use of intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of macrocyclic lactones for ectoparasite control has also increased to 0.24 of all sheep treated in 2005 compared with 0.1 in 1997. The proportion of sheep treated in communal spray showers also increased from 0.01 in 1997 to 0.14 in 2005. Control of blowfly maggots (Lucilia spp.) and prevention of sheep scab (Psoroptes ovis) were the main reasons given by farmers for sheep treatments. On the farms that plunge-dipped, an estimated 0.68 of surplus dip wash was disposed of immediately after dipping took place, with 0.8 of farms emptying the dipping tanks using a vacuum tanker and 0.54 spreading the surplus dip wash directly onto land. An estimated 0.35 of these farmers mixed the dip wash with slurry pre-disposal. The survey suggests that the products used for spray showers are those recommended for plunge-dipping as there are no contemporary products recommended for use in spray showers.

Cantaloupe production in the southwestern USA has been confronted by epidemics of CYSDV since 2006 when itwas first identified inArizona and California. As a phloem-limited virus that is vectored in a semi-persistent manner by B. tabaci, CYSDV has transmission characteristics thatmay be suppressed by select insecticide applications. RESULTS: Eight active ingredients formulated as foliar and/or soil-applied insecticideswere tested to determine the suppressive effect on transmission and incidence of CYSDV in greenhouse and field studies. Many compounds limited virus transmission to <10% infected plants even when challenged by 30 viruliferous whiteflies. Foliar formulations had greater knockdown activity than their soil-applied analogs and resulted in lower virus transmission. Insecticides that had the greatest effect on reducing virus transmission in the greenhouse also showed the lowest incidence of CYSDV in field trials. CONCLUSIONS: Select insecticides can significantly reduce transmission of CYSDV. However, insecticidemanagement of CYSDV incidence in cantaloupes has limitations in chronically high infestation areas such as the southwestern USA, and is often only able to delay disease onset rather than prevent its occurrence.

In controlling the population of larvae and adult mosquito using chemical pesticide spraying through fogging method, the dilution rate based on the efficient mixing of pesticide and biodiesel is yet to be investigated. A simulation field trial was conducted indoor in a visible container with the designed dimension of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm with the method of fogging was adapted from the principle of thermal fogger. The biodiesel was produced through the transesterification reaction of palm oil with methanol using hydrotalcite as catalysts. To evaluate the larvicidal and adulticidal mortality, dilution of pesticide which is Sumithion L-40 into biodiesel as liquid carrier is varied. The 5 ml pesticide-carrier mixture with the dilution ratio of 1:9, 3:7 and 5:5 were used and dispersed into the ambient in the form of fog. After several tests, it can be deduced that the most effective dilution ratio for against larvae is 1:9 and adult mosquito is 5:5. The larvae mortality rate achieved 100% at the duration of 117 min due to effective settlement of the spraying droplet of formulation mixture on exposed water. The result also proven that, biodiesel as liquid carrier capable to overcome the solubility problem encountered by the conventional petroleum-based carrier. The adult mosquito needs shorter knockdown time with the higher dosage of pesticide. Sumithion L-40 consists of two active ingredients which are tetramethrin and fenitrothion that provide quick knockdown and residual effect especially to adult mosquito. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

CNTs tend to form aggregates, thus CNTs dispersion was commonly produced by sonication with surfactant in industry for better application. In the present study, a novel passive sampling method was used to systematically study sorption of triclosan to CNTs dispersion to give a better understanding on their interactions especially with the presence of surface-active substances. With the increase of anionic surfactant concentration (SDBS or SDS), sorption of triclosan was gradually suppressed. CNTs dispersed by nonionic surfactant TX-100 increased or decreased sorption at different TX-100 and triclosan concentration. Little amount of cationic surfactant CTAB(1 mg/L) could sharply decrease triclosan sorption to CNTs but with larger CTAB concentration, sorption was continually increased. Sorption isotherms of triclosan to CNTs dispersion with 40 mg/L and 100 mg/L surfactant fitted well with Toth model show the existence of double competition in the sorption process.

Despite newer and potent chemicals as pesticides, there are still substantial crop losses, and if by any means this loss can be tackled; it will alleviate unwanted excessive use of chemical pesticides. Scientific surveys have already established that pesticides are not being utilized by the crops completely rather a significant amount remains unused due to various limiting factors such as leaching and bioconversion, etc., resulting in an adverse effect on human health and ecosystems. Concerted efforts from scientific diaspora toward newer and innovative strategies are already showing promise, and one such viable approach is controlled release systems (CRS) of pesticides. Moreover, to bring these smart formulations within the domain of current pesticide regulatory framework is still under debate. It is thus, paramount to discuss the pros and cons of this new technology vis-a-vis the conventional agrarian methods.

On the other hand, pest control is made through products containing lethal chemicals for insects, nematodes, fungi or bacteria. These products used in agriculture including, fertilizers, plant growth stimulants, and pesticides may be of synthetic or natural origin. Many years ago, the man, observing the natural processes of ecosystems balance, discovered that there are living organisms (plants, bacteria, fungi, insects, mites, algae, nematodes, etc.) capable of influencing many soil processes associated with N fixation, P solubilization, vitamins and phytohormones production to promote plant growth, enzymes involved in the decomposition of organic matter, natural enemy insects controlling pests, and microorganisms controlling diseases. This observation of nature led to the development of bio-based products for agricultural use, and today this biotechnology industry is growing faster than the knowledge and regulation policies. The bio-product term refers to all products originated on renewable biological resources. Regarding agricultural bioproducts, these are used in fertilization, plant growth stimulation or biological control, and their active ingredients can be plants, algae, extracts, microorganisms or active metabolites. In the case of microorganisms, in which this article focuses, bioproducts are produced under controlled biotechnological processes, in order to achieve the desired growth of microorganisms or the production of metabolites of interest in a concentrated manner.

Concerns over the widespread use of 2,4-D-based herbicides has led to the development of alternative herbicides with low use rates or classifications such as reduced risk or organic. The objective of this study was to test alternative herbicide products in the field and compare their efficacy to a standard three-way mixture containing 2,4-D, dicamba, and mecoprop. Nine different herbicides were tested for their efficacy over a 3-year period on a turfgrass lawn in Madison, WI. All treatments reduced weed cover compared with the non-treated control. The three-way standard herbicide Trimec 1000 consistently reduced weed populations most effectively. Low-use-rate products like Defendor and Turflon Ester Ultra and the mineral oil-based adjuvant Civitas WEEDfree all reduced weed populations to levels comparable to that of Trimec 1000.

Our results show that the photostabilities of two fungicides were affected by the type of paper used as the application monitor and by pesticide formulation. In side-by-side comparisons using an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation, rapid photodegradation of both fungicides occurred when applied to white proportional to-cellulose paper. Only 10 to 35% of the applied C-14-fungicides remained as parent after 15-min irradiation in a Suntest photolysis chamber. Dark controls exhibited no losses or degradation under study conditions. In contrast, greater than 85% of the compounds remained as parent when applied to brown Kraft paper. These effects were attributed, in part, to enhanced scattering of light by the white background of the proportional to-cellulose paper. When applied as a suspension concentrate (SC) formulation, both fungicides were stable to photolysis on proportional to-cellulose and Kraft papers.

In human medicine, chitosan is used as a stabilizer for active ingredients in tablets, and is popular in slimming diets. Due to its low toxicity, it was the first basic substance approved by the European Union for plant protection (Reg. EU 2014/563), for both organic agriculture and integrated pest management. When applied to plants, chitosan shows triple activity: (i) elicitation of host defenses; (ii) antimicrobial activity; and (iii) film formation on the treated surface. The eliciting activity of chitosan has been studied since the 1990's, which started with monitoring of enzyme activities linked to defense mechanisms (e.g., chitinase, beta-1,3 glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) in different fruit (e.g., strawberry, other berries, citrus fruit, table grapes). This continued with investigations with qRT-PCR (Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction), and more recently, with RNA-Seq. The antimicrobial activity of chitosan against a wide range of plant pathogens has been confirmed through many in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Once applied to a plant surface (e.g., dipping, spraying), chitosan forms an edible coating, the properties of which (e.g., thickness, viscosity, gas and water permeability) depend on the acid in which it is dissolved. Based on data in literature, we propose that overall, the eliciting represents 30 to 40% of the chitosan activity, its antimicrobial activity 35 to 45%, and its film-forming activity 20 to 30%, in terms of its effectiveness in the control of postharvest decay of fresh fruit. As well as being used alone, chitosan can be applied together with many other alternatives to synthetic fungicides, to boost its eliciting, antimicrobial and film-forming properties, with additive, and at times synergistic, interactions. Several commercial chitosan formulations are available as biopesticides, with their effectiveness due to the integrated combination of these three mechanisms of action of chitosan.",2018,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02745

Materials and Methods: We applied the comet assay on blood and four mouse organs (kidney liver, bone marrow, and spleen) to evaluate possible genome damage caused by Gesaprim(R) containing atrazine as an active ingredient. Male CBA mice were assigned to four treatment groups and a control group. Gesaprin(R) was injected intraperitoneally once. It was given at the dose of 1.08 ml/g so that the dose of atrazine contained within the pesticide formulation given was 540 mg/kg and 0.07 mul of Gesaprim(R)/kg so that the dose of atrazine contained within the pesticide formulation was 3.5 x 10(-2) mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the treatment. Alkaline comet assay on the blood samples, kidney, liver, bone marrow and spleen was performed. Results: Statistically significant (p < 0.01) increase was found in tail length for all 5 tissues examined in mice treated by Gesaprimo compared to the control.

From a sustainability perspective, organic farming offers an eco-friendly cultivation system that minimizes agrochemicals and producing food with little or no environmental footprint. However, organic agriculture's biggest drawback is the generally lower and variable yield in contrast to conventional farming. Compatible with organic farming, the selective use of biostimulants can close the apparent yield gap between organic and conventional cultivation systems. A biostimulant is defined as natural microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) or biologically active substances that are able to improve plant growth and yield through several processes. Biostimulants are derived from a range of natural resources including organic materials (composts, seaweeds), manures (earthworms, fish, insects) and extracts derived from microbes, plant, insect or animal origin. The current trend is indicative that a mixture of biostimulants is generally delivering better growth, yield and quality rather than applying biostimulant individually. When used correctly, biostimulants are known to help plants cope with stressful situations like drought, salinity, extreme temperatures and even certain diseases. More research is needed to understand the different biostimulants, key components, and also to adjust the formulations to improve their reliability in the field. Demand for organically grown food crops is rising substantially annually owing to their contributions to human health. However, organic farm production is still generally lower compared to conventional farming. Nutrient availability, content consistency, uptake, assimilation, and crop responses to various stresses were reported as critical yield-limiting factors in many organic farming systems. In recent years, plant biostimulants (BSs) have gained much interest from researchers and growers, and with the objective of integrating these products to enhance nutrient use efficiency (NUE), crop performance, and delivering better stress resilience in organic-related farming. This review gave an overview of direct and indirect mechanisms of microbial and non-microbial BSs in enhancing plant nutrient uptake, physiological status, productivity, resilience to various stressors, and soil-microbe-plant interactions. BSs offer a promising, innovative and sustainable strategy to supplement and replace agrochemicals in the near future. With greater mechanistic clarity, designing purposeful combinations of microbial and non-microbial BSs that would interact synergistically and deliver desired outcomes in terms of acceptable yield and high-quality products sustainably will be pivotal. Understanding these mechanisms will improve the next generation of novel and well-characterized BSs, combining microbial and non-microbial BSs strategically with specific desired synergistic bio-stimulatory action, to deliver enhanced plant growth, yield, quality, and resilience consistently in organic-related cultivation.",2022,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11010041

Flufenoxuron is a recently introduced insecticide. The compound is known to exert its insecticidal activity by inhibiting chitin synthesis in insects. However, its toxic effects on humans are unknown. Case report. A 72-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department by ambulance. The person accompanying her brought an empty 100-mL bottle of an insecticide (Cascade T), which was found at the scene. The active ingredient of the product is flufenoxuron and the other components include surfactants and solvents. A detailed composition obtained from the manufacturer was flufenoxuron, ethoxylated nonylphenol phosphate, polyoxyethylene nonylphenol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and cyclohexanone. Upon arrival at the intensive care unit (ICU), her arterial pH was 7.093, her bicarbonate level was 7.4 mEq/L, and the anion gap was 33.8 mEq/L. Her lactic acid concentration was 16.5 mmol/L. Lactic acidosis was not considered to be a consequence of circulatory shock, because there was no clinical sign of shock other than lactic acidosis, and cardiac output was never below 4.5 L/min. Her acid-base status began to improve and returned to near normal on the next day. Conclusion. It can be hypothesized that the toxicity of the product includes inhibition of the oxygen utilization mechanism at the cellular level. The product is composed of a number of components, similar to many other herbicide products.

Fludioxonil was superior to other treatments. PS was the most effective additive. Synergistic effects between antifungal treatments and CA storage were observed. After 15 weeks of storage at 7.2 degrees C, the combination of PS treatment (3 min dip in 3% solution at 21 degrees C) and CA storage was as effective as the combination of heated fludioxonil (30 s dip in 0.6 g L-1 of active ingredient at 49 degrees C) and air storage. Mixtures of PS with SB or SC did not improve the efficacy of either treatment alone. In tests conducted in commercial facilities, decay development and external and internal fruit quality were assessed on naturally infected pomegranates stored in either air or CA after application of a selected postharvest antifungal combined treatment (CTrt) integrating PS, SB + chlorine, and fludioxonil. CTrt was effective in controlling natural gray mold after 6 weeks of storage at 8.9 degrees C, but lacked persistence and it was not effective after 14 weeks. CA storage greatly enhanced decay control ability of CTrt. Skin red color was better maintained in CA-stored than in air-stored fruit. Juice color and properties (SSC, TA, and pH) were not practically affected by either postharvest treatment or storage condition. The integration of PS treatments with CA storage could provide an alternative to synthetic fungicides for the management of pomegranate postharvest decay. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This methodology was based on the direct measurement of the transmittance spectra of solid samples and a multivariate calibration model to determine the active ingredient concentration. The proposed partial least squares (PLS) model was made using nine standards prepared by mixing different amounts of kaolin and Mancozeb, with concentrations between 5.43 and 88.10% (w/w). A hierarchical cluster analysis was made in order to classify the samples in terms of similarity in the PAS-FTIR spectra. From their spectra different commercially available fungicide samples were classified in four groups, attending to the presence of other active ingredients co-formulated with Mancozeb. Different PLS models were applied for the analysis of each group of samples. So, for samples containing copper oxychloride (group 1), the information in the spectral range from 1543 to 1474 and 1390 to 1269 cm(-1) was employed. For samples co-formulated with Fosetyl-Al (group 2) the range between 3334 and 3211 cm(-1), corrected with a single point baseline located at 3055 cm(-1), was used. For samples containing Metalaxyl (group 3) it was used the information in the spectral range from 1543 to 1474 km(-1) was used to determine Mancozeb. Finally, the range between 1456 and 1306 cm(-1) was used for Mancozeb determination in samples containing Cymoxanil (group 4). The PLS factors used for Mancozeb determination depends on the PLS model employed. 3, 2, 2 and 3 factors were used for Mancozeb determination in commercially available pesticides for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The mean accuracy errors found were 3.1, 2.1, 2.5 and 3.0% for groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

However, previous studies are more focused on the active pesticide ingredients than the adjuvants. Thus, this study investigates the changes in toxic effects of surfactants during photodegradation, which is one way of naturally degrading contaminants in natural waters. Triton X-100, a water-soluble non-ionic surfactant, was degraded using different types of UV radiation (UVA, UVB, and UVC), and the changes in the toxic effects were determined using bioluminescent bacteria and water flea. The Triton X-100 removals were negligible with UVA within 24 h, while its removal was 81% with UVB and almost complete with UVC. The NMR spectra indicated possible molecule rearrangement after photolysis. On the other hand, the toxic effects based on the mortality of Daphnia magna and the bioluminescence of Aliivibrio fischeri increased (i.e., lower EC50 values) after photodegradation, suggesting the generation of photoproducts that are likely to have higher toxic effects or higher bioavailability. Furthermore, the sensitivities of D. magna and A. fischeri for Triton X-100 and the photodegraded Triton X-100 were different. This study suggests that the changes in the chemical composition of the Triton X-100 containing water with photodegradation can lead to changes in the relative toxic effects on different aquatic organisms. Therefore, not only the management of parent compound (i.e., Triton X-100) but also the photoproducts generated from the parent compound need to be considered when managing water environment subject to photodegradation.",2021,28,11224,11232,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11362-2

The resulting structural formula of this organoclay based on thermogravimetric analysis was Si2Al2O5(OH)(3.72)(OCH3)(0.28)(MV)(0.17)(H2O)(0.82). The release of MV from the K-MV composite was studied in order to evaluate the advantages of using this material for pesticide formulation with MV as active ingredient. The localization of MV in the interlayer space of K-M significantly slows its release in water. However, the interactions that retain MV in the interlayer space remain sufficiently less intense to ensure a complete release of MV in a relatively short time (2 h). On the basis of the interactions that ensure MV intercalation in methoxykaolinite, K-M was used as electrode modifier and applied for the electrochemical determination of MV. The electrochemical signal of MV on the K-M modified electrode was 2 times more intense compared to the pristine kaolinite modified electrode. After optimization of experimental parameters, a sensitivity of 3.91 mu A M-1 and a detection limit of 0.14 nM were obtained at the KM modified electrode.

Microbial pesticides are being introduced in this new scenario of crop protection and currently several beneficial microorganisms are the active ingredients of a new generation of microbial pesticides or the basis for many natural products of microbial origin. The development of a microbial pesticide requires several steps addressed to its isolation in pure culture and screening by means of efficacy bioassays performed in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo, or in pilot trials under real conditions of application (field, greenhouse, post-harvest). For the commercial delivery of amicrobial pesticide, the biocontrol agent must be produced at an industrial scale (fermentation), preserved for storage and formulated by means of biocompatible additives to increase survival and to improve the application and stability of the final product. Despite the relative high number of patents for biopesticides, only a few of them have materialized in a register, for agricultural use. The excessive specificity in most cases and biosafety or environmental concerns in others are major limiting factors. Non-target effects may be possible in particular cases, such as displacement of beneficial microorganisms, allergenicity, toxinogenicity (production of secondary metabolites toxic to plants, animals, or humans), pathogenicity (to plants or animals) by the agent itself or due to contaminants, or horizontal gene transfer of these characteristics to nontarget microorganisms. However, these non-target effects should not be evaluated in an absolute manner, but relative to chemical control or the absence of any control of the target disease (for example, toxins derived from the pathogen). Consumer concerns about live microbes due to emerging food-borne diseases and bioterrorism do not help to create a socially receptive environment to microbial pesticides. The future of microbial pesticides is not only in developing new active ingredients based on microorganisms beneficial to plants, but in producing self-protected plants (so-called plant-incorporated pesticides) by transforming agronomically high-value crop plants with genes from biological control agents.",2003,6,245,252,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10123-003-0144-x

The effects of Triton X-100 on the growth of wheat and lettuce were studied and the germination and shoot growth of wheat were not significantly affected by Triton X-100. With lettuce, the increasing Triton X-100 concentrations tend to negatively affect the growth, possibly due to the absorption of Triton X-100 by lettuce. The average lettuce fresh mass was reduced by 31% when Triton X-100 concentration increased from 0 to 240 mg L-1. This may mean that chemicals dissolved or mobilized by Triton X-100 can be absorbed by lettuce. The Cd mobilization was facilitated with Triton X-100, and the absorption of procymidone in soil by lettuce was greater when Triton X-100 was applied (i.e., 0.18 mg kg(-1)) than when water was applied (i.e., 0.15 mg kg(-1)), although they were statistically not different (p-value > 0.05). The average lettuce masses in the presence of residual procymidone in soil and Triton X-100 (16 g) were lower than that of the control soils (20 g), although they were statistically not different (p-value > 0.05). The results suggest that surfactants contained in pesticide formulations can potentially affect crop growth and absorption of other contaminants. Therefore, the residual surfactants and active ingredients in pesticide formulations need to be properly managed to protect the environment and to produce crops free of contaminants.",2021,64,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-021-00615-4

Both SNNMs are multifaceted agricultural inputs-plant protectants, plant biostimulants/plant strengtheners, soil improvers. The effects depend on the plant parts, where such siliceous natural nanomaterials (SNNMs) are applied. For stored grains, SNNMs act as plant protectants. Foliar applied SNNMs protect plants against biotic and abiotic stress-plant protectant and plant strengtheners. When applied to soil/roots, SNNMs stimulate root development and improve soil characteristics. These effects are related to the composition and porous (nano)structure of SNNMs. The large active siliceous surfaces of SNNMs are involved in: desiccation of the insects damaging stored grains, fungistatic effects against mycotoxigenic fungi and adsorption of their mycotoxins, desiccation of foliar pathogens and pests, stimulation of photosynthesis, release of soluble silicon species, improved soil characteristics. Similar to other biorationals from the category of basic substances with low risk, the SNNMs efficacy as plant protectants and plant health strengtheners is rather low. Complementary active ingredients should be used to enhance the effects of SNNMs on treated plants.

Synergism of lambda-cyhalothrin and fipronil using piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was also assessed. RESULTS: The order of susceptibility of different stages of bed bugs was as follows: early stage - lambda-cyhalothrin > bifenthrin = imidacloprid > fipronil > fenitrothion > DDT; late stage - lambda-cyhalothrin > bifenthrin > fenitrothion > imidacloprid > fipronil > DDT; adult - lambda-cyhalothrin > imidacloprid > bifenthrin > fenitrothion > fipronil > DDT. The late instars exhibited significantly higher LT(50) among the life stages. The addition of PBO to fipronil increased the susceptibility of the insects. CONCLUSIONS: Lambda-cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, fenitrothion and fipronil at the recommended application rates were effective against C. hemipterus. Although imidacloprid demonstrated good initial response against C. hemipterus, the insects showed substantial recovery 72 h post-treatment.

To manage plant diseases and insect pests, pesticides are inevitably used in agriculture. However, the higher dosage of these chemicals on a per hectare basis has resulted in many environmental and health hazards. To tackle the conventional pesticide related issues, a new field of science called nanotechnology has led to the development of nanopesticides that have less active ingredients, but better efficiency. The nanopesticides contain the carrier molecule or the active nanosized ingredient with a very high surface area to the volume property that provides them unique exploitable-advantages. Several formulations, viz., nanoemulsions, nanosuspensions, nano gels, metal compound-based nanopesticides, have been developed for different modes of action and vivid applications. The biggest advantage comes due to the small size of the particles that helps in properly spreading the ingredients on the pest surface and, thus, producing a better action than conventional pesticides. The use of nanoparticles in the form of nanopesticides, nanofertilisers, and nano delivery systems is on the increase day by day due to their higher efficiency and reduced dosage requirements. However, human beings and other organisms are also getting exposed to the nano-entities during the application or afterwards.

We followed the variation of the steric energy during the complexation, computing different structural and energetic factors of the interactions using self-developed formula and software. Water molecules negatively affected the inclusion process because guest molecules must extrude them; consequently the formulation process requires higher energy.

We then investigated how exposure to a glyphosate concentration gradient (0 center dot 36, 3 center dot 6, 36 mg active ingredient (a.i.) L-1) affected the production and release of the infective cercarial stage of the parasite by its snail intermediate host Potamopyrgus antipodarum. 3. Survival of juvenile fish was unaffected by exposure to glyphosate alone (at an environmentally relevant concentration; 0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1) or by T. opisthorchis infection alone. However, simultaneous exposure to infection and glyphosate significantly reduced fish survival. 4. Juvenile fish developed spinal malformations when exposed either to infections alone or to infections and glyphosate, with a trend towards greater severity of spinal malformation after exposure to both stressors. 5. All snails exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (36 mg a.i. L-1) died within 24 h. Snails exposed to a moderate concentration (3 center dot 6 mg a.i. L-1) produced significantly more T. opisthorchis cercariae than snails in the control group or the low concentration group (0 center dot 36 mg a.i. L-1; the same concentration as in the fish experiment). 6. Synthesis and applications. This is the first study to show that parasites and glyphosate can act synergistically on aquatic vertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations, and that glyphosate might increase the risk of disease in fish. Our results have important implications when identifying risks to aquatic communities and suggest that threshold levels of glyphosate currently set by regulatory authorities do not adequately protect freshwater systems.",2010,47,498,504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01791.x

One of the most important properties of these nanoformulations is the proportion of pesticide associated with the nanocarriers (encapsulation efficiency, EE). EE is often determined by centrifugal ultrafiltration. However, the losses of active ingredient in the centrifugal ultrafiltration devices are typically not assessed, potentially leading to erroneous results. In this work, the losses of three pesticides (tebuconazole, terbuthylazine and chlorpyrifos) during centrifugal ultrafiltration have been systematically evaluated for nine different devices. Results suggest that centrifugal ultrafiltration is not suitable for determining the EE of compounds such as chlorpyrifos as 100% losses were observed on all the devices tested. Losses of tebuconazole and terbuthylazine were highly variable according to the type of membrane and the lowest losses were observed in the devices with hydrophilic regenerated cellulose membranes. Based on these results, we propose a correction factor and demonstrate its application to calculate the EE of two nanoformulations based on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) nanocarriers. The approach extends the applicability of centrifugal ultrafiltration to a wider range of pesticide nanoformulations. We also discuss the effect of dilution on EE and make recommendations to improve the characterisation of nanoparticles-based pesticide nanoformulations in the future.",2021,13,5410,5418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0nr08693b

Rotenone, a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial cellular respiration, is the active ingredient of the piscicide; however, other rotenoids of unknown persistence and toxicity account for an equivalent amount by weight. This work identified six distinct rotenoids in CFT Legumine using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry and optimized a rapid surface water sampling procedure for their analysis.

Sorption of pesticides in reconstituted cuticular wax (wax/water partition coefficients) of Chenopodium album L. and in isolated cuticular membranes (cuticle/water partition coefficients) of Prunus laurocerasus L. was determined. Diffusion coefficients of pesticides in reconstituted cuticular wax of C. album leaves were size-dependent, increasing with increasing molar volume. In the presence of alcohol ethoxylates, diffusion coefficients were enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude, and size selectivity was significantly decreased. The accelerating effect and the decrease in size selectivity were attributed to plasticisation of the cuticular wax by the alcohol ethoxylates increasing the fluidity in the wax. A free volume model adopted from polymer science was successfully applied to predict diffusion coefficients of pesticides on the basis of the transport properties of the wax (size selectivity and crystallinity), the molar volume of the diffusing compound and the accelerator concentration in the wax.

With a new translaminar model, the transport across the leaf cuticle and tissues and the electrochemical distribution of test compounds in cellular compartments and apoplast were calculated. RESULTSThe comparison of both information sets revealed that the intracellular localisation of active ingredients determines the performance of test compounds against different target pests because of different feeding behaviours: mites feed on mesophyll, and aphids and whiteflies mostly in the vascular system. Polar compounds have a slow adsorption into leaf cells and thus a favourable distribution into apoplast and xylem sap. Slightly lipophilic bases get trapped in vacuoles, which is a less suited place to control hemipteran pests but appropriate to control mites. Non-favourable cellular localisation led to a strong reduction in translaminar efficacy against phloem feeders. CONCLUSIONPrediction and optimisation of intracellular localisation of pesticides add valuable new information for targeted bioavailability and can indicate directions for improved pesticide design.

In this research, we studied the role of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in detoxification of permethrin by ticks using a gene silencing method RNA interference (RNAi). The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, used in these studies, has a notable host preference for dogs, but also infests other mammals. In this research, R. sanguineus females were injected with gst double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to effect gene silencing by RNAi and then exposed to sublethal doses of permethrin. Sixty hours after injection, the females were allowed to feed on sheep. The female ticks subjected to RNAi proved to be more susceptible to permethrin than the untreated controls. The effect of gene silencing was most notable in the highest dose group (50.3 ppm) in which all ticks died, while in the corresponding controls that were not subjected to RNAi this dose was not lethal. The acaricide treatment of the ticks resulted in a change in tick attachment behavior. Acaricide-treated ticks attached in a scattered pattern in contrast to the control ticks that attached and fed tightly clustered together. The time required for repletion for both the injected and non-injected females exposed to the higher permethrin level was shorter than that observed in the lower-dose groups and unexposed controls, and this more rapid attachment and feeding would likely favor more rapid transmission of pathogens. However, engorgement and egg mass weights were not significantly different among the experimental groups. This research demonstrated that the silencing of the gst gene increased the tick's susceptibility to permethrin. Overall, these results have contributed to our understanding of the detoxification mechanism of ticks and provide new considerations for the formulation of treatment strategies.

In the current study, we evaluated two chlorantraniliprole formulations, WG (wettable granule) and SC (suspension concentrate), as maize protectants against P. truncatus adults at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Both formulations performed similarly. The highest mortality was noted in chlorantraniliprole WG, at 10 ppm and 30 degrees C (98.9%), followed by chlorantraniliprole SC (96.1%), at the same dose and temperature. WG formulation was more effective at 10 ppm and 25 degrees C (92.8%) than SC formulation (89.4%). No progeny production was noted on maize treated the WG formulation at 20 and 30 degrees C. The SC formulation caused complete offspring suppression at 10 ppm at all three tested temperatures. The results indicate that chlorantraniliprole is an effective compound with a high insecticidal activity against T. truncatus that depends on temperature, dose and exposure. The larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae) is one of the most destructive insect pests of stored maize and dried tubers of cassava, and a wood-boring species. In the present study, we examined two chlorantraniliprole formulations, WG (wettable granule) with 350 g/kg active ingredient (a.i.) and SC (suspension concentrate) with 200 g/L a.i., as maize protectants against P. truncatus adults.

After 7 days of exposure, the overall mortality provided by both formulations was very low (<17%). Seven days later, mortality was remarkably increased on maize treated with 1 and 10 ppm at 25 and 30 degrees C for both formulations. The highest mortality was noted in chlorantraniliprole WG, at 10 ppm and 30 degrees C (98.9%), followed by chlorantraniliprole SC (96.1%), at the same dose and temperature.

However, their ecological impacts are not independent of environmental conditions. For example, the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has contributed to population declines and extinctions in many amphibian species, interacts with several environmental factors to influence its hosts, but potential interactions with other pathogens and environmental contaminants are understudied. We examined the combined effects of Bd, a water mold (Achlya sp.), and the herbicide Roundup (R) Regular (hereafter, Roundup (R)) on larval Pacific treefrog Hyliola regilla hosts. We employed a 2 wk, fully factorial laboratory experiment with 3 ecologically realistic levels (0, 1, and 2 mg l(-1) of active ingredient) of field-formulated Roundup (R), 2 Achlya treatments (present and absent), and 2 Bd treatments (present and absent). Our results were consistent with sublethal interactive effects involving all 3 experimental factors. When Roundup (R) was absent, the proportion of Bd-exposed larvae infected with Bd was elevated in the presence of Achlya, consistent with Achlya acting as a synergistic cofactor that facilitated the establishment of Bd infection. However, this Achlya effect became nonsignificant at 1 mg l(-1) of the active ingredient of Roundup (R) and disappeared at the highest Roundup (R) concentration. In addition, Roundup (R) decreased Bd loads among Bd-exposed larvae. Our study suggests complex interactive effects of a water mold and a contaminant on Bd infection in amphibian hosts.

RK Jansen and its nanoemulsion: Insecticidal, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,"Acmella oleracea (L.) R.K. Jansen, also named jambu, is an edible and medicinal plant native to Brazil but extensively cultivated all over the world due to its diverse utilizations in food, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and pest management science. Most of applications are related to the presence of active ingredients, namely alkylamides, among which spilanthol is the most important one. On the other hand, the plant biomass resulting from the largescale cultivation of A. oleracea may yield an essential oil (EO), which can be used for some industrial purposes, for instance as larvicide against vector mosquitoes. This EO is mainly characterized by mono- and sesquiterpenes, however also spilanthol can be detected in the mixture. To maximize the content of spilanthol in the A. oleracea EO, A. oleracea aerial parts obtained from a cultivation in central Italy were subjected to microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). This procedure allowed to obtain a higher yield and spilanthol content when compared with traditional hydrodistillation (0.47 v 0.22 %, and 13.31 vs 2.24 %, respectively). The EO terpene fraction was mainly represented by beta-pinene (10.8 %), myrcene (12.3 %), (E)-caryophyllene (19.4 %) and alpha-humulene (1.1 %). The A. oleracea EO was encapsulated into a nanoemulsion (NE) containing 6 % EO using a high-energy method. The formulation physical stability was assessed by optical microscope and DLS analyses at different timepoints showing stability up to one year of storage. The A. oleracea EO and its NE, along with the isolated spilanthol, were evaluated for acute toxicity against the 3rd instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, a filariasis and arbovirus vector of public health importance, achieving LC50 values of 16.1, 407.5, and 3.1 ILL/L, respectively. The larvicidal activity seemed to be not dependent on the interaction with the cholinergic system, as shown by the high IC50 values of A. oleracea EO and spilanthol exhibited in the anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) assay. Testing LC30 values, the A. oleracea-borne products showed a significant impact on larval development, fecundity, fertility and natality of C. quinquefasciatus. Testing LC30 values, the A. oleracea EO-NE provided a higher efficacy than spilanthol, reducing the adult fertility, in terms of egg hatchability (%) and the overall abundance of F1 larvae. These results can be considered as promising for the development of new mosquito larvicides.

Glyphosate targets the shikimate metabolic pathway, which is found in plants but not in animals. Despite the relative safety of glyphosate, various adverse developmental and reproductive problems have been alleged as a result of exposure in humans and animals. To assess the developmental and reproductive safety of glyphosate, an analysis of the available literature was conducted. Epidemiological and animal reports, as well as studies on mechanisms of action related to possible developmental and reproductive effects of glyphosate, were reviewed. An evaluation of this database found no consistent effects of glyphosate exposure on reproductive health or the developing offspring. Furthermore, no plausible mechanisms of action for such effects were elucidated. Although toxicity was observed in studies that used glyphosate-based formulations, the data strongly suggest that such effects were due to surfactants present in the formulations and not the direct result of glyphosate exposure. To estimate potential human exposure concentrations to glyphosate as a result of working directly with the herbicide, available biomonitoring data were examined. These data demonstrated extremely low human exposures as a result of normal application practices. Furthermore, the estimated exposure concentrations in humans are > 500-fold less than the oral reference dose for glyphosate of 2 mg/kg/d set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S.

The leaching of the active ingredients associated with the seed coatings and the sorption to soil was evaluated under laboratory conditions using commercially available corn and soybean seeds to study the fate and transport of these pesticides under controlled conditions. The active ingredients (AI) included one neonicotinoid insecticide (thiamethoxam) and five fungicides (azoxystrobin, fludioxonil, metalaxyl, sedaxane thiabendazole). An aqueous leaching experiment was conducted with treated corn and soybean seeds. Leaching potential was a function of solubility and seed type. The leaching of fludioxonil, was dependent on seed type with a shorter time to equilibrium on the corn compared to the soybean seeds. Sorption experiments with the treated seeds and a solution of the AIs were conducted using three different soil types. Sorption behavior was a function of soil organic matter as well as seed type. For most AIs, a negative relationship was observed between the aqueous concentration and the log K-oc. Sorption to all soils tested was limited for the hydrophilic pesticides thiamethoxam and metalaxyl. However, partitioning for the more hydrophobic fungicides was dependent on both seed type and soil properties. The mobility of fludioxonil in the sorption experiment varied by seed type indicating that the adjuvants associated with the seed coating could potentially play a role in the environmental fate of fludioxonil. This is the first study to assess, under laboratory conditions, the fate of pesticides associated with seed coatings using commercially available treated seeds. This information can be used to understand how alterations in agricultural practices (e.g., increasing use of seed treatments) can impact the exposure (concentration and duration) and potential effects of these chemicals to aquatic and terrestrial organisms.",2018,53,176,183,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2017.1405619

The field persistence in sugarcane soil of two isolates of M. anisopliae each in four formulations was tested by mixing the formulation with soil which was then placed in PVC rings and buried in sugarcane fields. The two isolates used were FI-1045, M. anisopliae var. anisopliae , the active ingredient in BioCane(TM) currently used for greyback canegrub control, Dermolepida albohirtum (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae), and FI-147, M. anisopliae var. lepidiotum , being tested as a biopesticide for Lepidiota spp. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae) and other species of canegrub. The four formulations were rice granules (as in BioCane(TM)), a wettable powder derived from conidia screened from the rice granules, conidia off rice suspended in water and conidia produced on agar plates, dried, and then mixed with water for adding to soil. FI-1045 was tested at three different sites in north Queensland with a range of soil types and climatic conditions while FI-147 was tested at three similarly diverse sites in southern Queensland. The PVC rings were destructively sampled every 6 months for 3.5 years and the number of viable conidia remaining determined by plating onto a selective medium. The exponential decay was determined. Monthly decay rates ranged from 0.0309 to 0.0835 (mean 0.0512). A small proportion of conidia survived the 3.5 years at all sites and all formulations. Overall, isolate FI-147 persisted better than FI-1045, but was used at the more Southerly sites. Rainfall and soil type had negligible effects on persistence. The agar-produced FI-147 conidia declined most slowly, while the two rice-produced but water-formulated conidia gave similar results. Isolate FI-1045 survived best as the BioCane(TM) formulation and this rice granule formulation was almost as persistent as the agar conidia with FI-147. A small proportion of conidia, in some formulations and at some sites, were recovered from immediately below the rings. This movement was thought to be due to activity of earthworms or mites. The results suggest that 3 years would be the maximum period for a BioCane(TM) formulation to provide some level of infection in the target pest unless augmented by conidia from infected grubs. The effectiveness of these new conidia may be reduced due to their highly aggregated distribution.",2003,13,507,516,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0958315031000140965

Invasive wild pigs cause extensive damage to ecological resources and agriculture. Development and registration of a safe and humane toxic bait offers a practical and cost-effective tool to control invasive species. Currently, no toxicants are approved for use on invasive wild pigs in the United States and those approved in Australia are under scrutiny because of concerns regarding humaneness and effects on nontarget species. We tested a newly formulated bait containing the micro-encapsulated active ingredient, sodium nitrite (HOGGONE((R)); Animal Control Technologies Australia P/L, Victoria, Australia), that is considered humane and safer for nontarget species because it does not bioaccumulate. We examined palatability, lethality, and stability of the bait (i.e., fresh compared to 8-month-old bait) on groups of captive invasive wild pigs. We found HOGGONE((R)) was a preferred food item, averaging 475 g of toxic bait consumed per animal during the first night offered. Consumption of HOGGONE((R)) resulted in 95% mortality (53 of 56) in the treatment groups across 2 treatment nights. Most mortalities (98%) occurred during the first night the toxic bait was offered. Camera evidence suggested that deaths occurred within 3 hr post-offering. The toxic bait was stable and effective up to 8 months post manufacture. Our results support current applications to register HOGGONE((R)) for reducing damage from invasive wild pigs in the United States and Australia. Further research is required to evaluate HOGGONE((R)) on free-ranging invasive wild pigs using bait stations that exclude nontarget species.

Nano-enabled pesticides may alter the functionality or risk profile of active ingredients. Cationic nanochitin whiskers (NC) possess strong biological activity against wheat aphids. However, toxicity and synergistic effects of NC with chemical pesticides against pest insects has not been systemically reported. This study investigated the insecticidal enhancement by NC with Omethoate (40% EC), Imidacloprid (10% WP), and Acetamiprid (40% WG) for pest control using wheat aphid as piercing-sucking mouthparts insect. Fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled NC was used to monitor the uptake and transportation pathway of NC inside the target insects. Toxicity of NC was tested with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for future application of NC in plant protection against pest insects. Results: NCs synthesized by acidic hydrolysis were rod-like nanoparticles in a range of 50-150 nm in length and 30-50 nm in width, which examined by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering methods. The charge density and zeta potential were about 63 mmol/kg and + 36.4 mV, respectively. By absorption and/or contact action of 30-50 mg/L of NC suspension, the corrected mortality of wheat aphids reached up to 80% or above after 12 h treatment, NC could be distributed through digestive system and relocated from mouth to other tissues inside the insect body. When associated with dilutions of conventional pesticides, the corrected mortality were significantly increased up to 95% or above. The dosage of the chemical pesticide and nanochitin in the mixtures (1:1 by volume) were all reduced to half. The acute oral toxicity Lethal Dose 50% (LD50) to SD rat is greater than 5000 mg/kg BW (body weight) in male and female, acute dermal toxicity LD50 is greater than 2000 mg/kg BW of NC. Conclusions: NC has a strong promotive effect on insecticidal effectiveness of chemical insecticides. It was easily absorbed by plant, transported and distributed from mouth to other tissues of the insects while sucking plant fluid. Low acute oral and dermal toxicity to SD rat indicated that it is safe to apply in agriculture and food industry.

To overcome these negative qualities, EOs can be encapsulated inside nanostructures (i.e. nanoparticles and nano-emulsions), which can guarantee the preservation of the insecticidal properties. In the current study, oil in water (O/W) nano-emulsions of seven commercial EOs (15 % w/w of anise, artemisia, fennel, lavender, peppermint, rosemary, sage) were developed using different non-ionic surfactants and formulation processes, to identify the best possible surfactant/process to produce stable nano-formulations. The EOs were firstly examined by gas-chromatography analyses to identify their chemical constituents. Sage, rosemary, peppermint, lavender and artemisia EOs were characterized by high percentage (up to 50 % of the detected compounds) of oxygenated monoterpenes, while fennel and anise EOs were mainly constituted by phenylpropenes (e.g. anethol). Then, nano-emulsions were developed via the self-emulsifying process alone or in combination with sonication, using four surfactants with different Hydrophilic Lipophilic Balance (HLB) index (5 % w/w of Tween 20, Tween 80, Span 20 or Span 80). The physical characteristics (droplet size and surface charge) of nano-emulsions were analyzed using the dynamic light-scattering technique. Sonicated nano-formulations presented smaller and more homogeneous size of the micelles than the non-sonicated ones, resulting in more stable nano-emulsions. Furthermore, usually emulsions produced using Tween 80 as surfactant gave the best results in terms of droplet size and polydispersity index (PDI) values. Therefore, Tween 80 sonicated nano-emulsions were examined during a storage period of 28 weeks to determine their stability over time and possible alteration of their physical characteristics. Results suggest that these nano-formulations had a good stability over time, since relatively small increases in PDI and size values were recorded. Formulation stability is a key issue to consider when proposing botanical biopesticides for agricultural applications.

The insecticides were applied at three dosages, equivalent to 50, 100, and 200 mg of active ingredient per kg of grain. Adults of the above species were exposed to the treated grains at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C and two relative humidity levels (55 and 75%), and mortality was assessed after 14 days of exposure. All adults were then removed, and the treated substrate remained under the same conditions for 45 more days. After this period, the grains were checked for progeny production. In both species and both commodities, mortality increased with insecticide dosage. For many dosage-formulation combinations, mortality increased with temperature at 55% relative humidity but the reverse was observed at 75% relative humidity. Comparing the two formulations, NeemAzal-T/S was more effective than Oikos 32 EC at all the combinations tested. NeemAzal-T/S was more effective at high relative humidity, but the efficacy of Oikos 32 EC was not much affected by the relative humidity. Survival was high, even at the higher dosages, in some of the temperature-humidity combinations. Progeny production of S. oryzae in the treated grains was considerably higher than that of T confusum. The results of the present study indicate that further dosage increases and longer exposure times are needed to obtain a complete (100%) adult mortality in all combinations tested. However, the feasibility of using higher azadirachtin dosages (> 200 mg/kg grain) is questionable for cost reasons. Consequently, the use of these substances is not comparable to the use of traditional grain protectants, which are usually used at dosages of < 5 mg/kg grain. Although azadirachtin-based insecticides can be used with success for protection of stored grain, our study demonstrated that under certain circumstances such an application may not be effective. Abiotic factors (formulation, temperature, and relative humidity) had a more serious impact on the efficacy of these insecticides than did biotic factors (target species and commodity).",2007,70,1627,1632,http://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-70.7.1627

Depending on the experiment, the formulations evaluated were those formerly manufactured by 3M Canada (London, ON, Canada) or those that are currently available from Suterra LLC (Bend, OR). The efficacy of MEC formulations applied by air-blast sprayer evenly throughout the entire canopy of 2-3-m-tall apple (Malus spp.) trees was equivalent to treatments in which targeted applications of MECs were made to the lower or upper 1.5 m of the canopy (at equivalent overall rates) for oriental fruit moth and both leafroller species. The realized distribution of deposited microcapsules within the tree canopy corresponded well with the intended heights of application within the canopy. The additional coapplication of the pine resin sticker Nu-Film 17 increased efficacy but not longevity of MEC formulations for oriental fruit moth; this adjuvant had no added effects for codling moth or leafroller formulations. Increasing the rate of active ingredient (AI) per hectare by 20-30-fold (range 2.5-75.0 g/ha) did not improve the disruption efficacy of MECs for codling moth or either leafroller species when both low and high rates were applied at equivalent frequencies per season. A low-rate, high-frequency (nine applications per season) application protocol was compared with a standard protocol in which two to three applications were made per season, once before each moth generation for each species. The low-rate, high-frequency protocol resulted in equivalent or better disruption efficacy for each moth species, despite using two-fold less total AI per hectare per season with the former treatment. The low-rate, frequent-application protocol should make the use of MEC formulations of synthetic pheromone more economical and perhaps more effective.",2007,100,1360,1369,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2007)100[1360:SMSPFF]2.0.CO;2

As pesticide solubilisation dehydrates the micellar shell and increases the effective hydrophobicity of the surfactant, we hypothesise that these micelles would uptake plant waxes and alter the amount of pesticide solubilized as a result of the re-equilibrating process. Experiments: The solubility of the pesticide cyprodinil (CP) and its effect on the shape of hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E6) micelles were studied using changes in cloud point, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Similarly, the solubility of wheat leaf waxes was examined, as was the effect of adding leaf waxes to pre-dissolved cyprodinil in micellar C12E6. Findings: Wax solubilisation caused pesticide release and shell hydration, and shortened the length of the cylindrical micelles of the CP loaded C12E6. Temperature increase led to a significant rise in the amount of the dissolved waxes, increased pesticide release, increased micellar length, and caused shrinkage and dehydration of the shell. This study indicates that agrochemical sprays are capable of dissolving leaf waxes, and may trigger pesticide release from surfactant micelles upon contact with plant surfaces.

It was found that glyphosate uptake into wheat was only moderately correlated (R(2) = 0.66) with surfactant EO content (range 5-20 units per molecule). By contrast, a highly negative correlation (R(2) = 0.98) was found between the uptake and the spread area of the treatment formulations on the leaf surface. The influence of droplet spreading on glyphosate uptake was further investigated using a super-spreading surfactant, Silwet L-77, and varying a.i. concentrations. It was demonstrated that the determining factor for glyphosate uptake into all 3 grass species was the a.i. dose (in mug/mm(2)) formed on the leaf surface after droplet spreading. Droplet spread area per se had only an indirect effect on the uptake through diluting the a.i. dose. In the presence of a non-spreading surfactant, Mon 0818, glyphosate uptake depended not only on the a.i. dose but also the surfactant dose on the leaf surface. In the absence of surfactants, high a.i. dose alone was not enough to ensure a high level uptake.

In order to study whether such a qualitative improvement of spray deposition would lead to improved disease control, a laboratory experiment was conducted on artificially inoculated grapevine (cv. Chardonnay) leaves. Prior to inoculation with Botrytis cinerea conidia in a spore settling tower, leaves were sprayed to pre-runoff with I mL of a mixture of fenhexamid, a fluorescent pigment, and one of 15 selected commercial adjuvants to manipulate the deposition quality of a specific quantity of spray. Following an incubation period of 24 h at high relative humidity, leaf discs were plated onto Petri dishes with paraquat-amended water agar and rated for development of B. cinerea from isolated leaf discs 11 d later. Spray deposition on leaves was assessed with a spray assessment protocol using fluorometry, photomicrography and digital image analyses. B. cinerea incidences on the upper and lower surfaces of water-sprayed leaves averaged 90.4% and 95.8%, respectively. Despite full spray cover of leaves, applications with fenhexamid alone did not completely prevent infection and resulted in 34.6% and 40.8% B. cinerea incidences on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, respectively. Through the addition of certain adjuvants, B. cinerea incidences were significantly reduced (incidences of 2.9-17.1% and 10.0-30.8%, respectively), while some adjuvants did not differ from the fungicide only treatment, even though they might have improved spray deposition. In a histopathology study using epifluorescence microscopy, distinct differences were observed in conidium mortality (20.5% vs. 31.2%), germination (60.4% vs. 51.4%) and germ tube lengths (27.8 mu m vs. 19.7 mu m) between Hydrosilicote and Solitaire in combination with fenhexamid, even though both adjuvants effected similar quantitative and qualitative spray deposition.

The massive and increasing use of GBHs results in not only the global burden of occupational exposures, but also increased exposure to the general population. The current pilot study represents the first phase of a long-term investigation of GBHs that we are conducting over the next 5 years. In this paper, we present the study design, the first evaluation of in vivo parameters and the determination of glyphosate and its major metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in urine. Methods: We exposed Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats orally via drinking water to a dose of glyphosate equivalent to the United States Acceptable Daily Intake (US ADI) of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, defined as the chronic Reference Dose (cRfD) determined by the US EPA, starting from prenatal life, i.e. gestational day (GD) 6 of their mothers. One cohort was continuously dosed until sexual maturity (6-week cohort) and another cohort was continuously dosed until adulthood (13-week cohort). Here we present data on general toxicity and urinary concentrations of glyphosate and its major metabolite AMPA. Results: Survival, body weight, food and water consumption of the animals were not affected by the treatment with either glyphosate or Roundup. The concentration of both glyphosate and AMPA detected in the urine of SD rats treated with glyphosate were comparable to that observed in animals treated with Roundup, with an increase in relation to the duration of treatment. The majority of glyphosate was excreted unchanged. Urinary levels of the parent compound, glyphosate, were around 100-fold higher than the level of its metabolite, AMPA. Conclusions: Glyphosate concentrations in urine showed that most part of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged parent compound upon glyphosate and Roundup exposure, with an increasing pattern of glyphosate excreted in urine in relation to the duration of treatment The adjuvants and the other substances present in Roundup did not seem to exert a major effect on the absorption and excretion of glyphosate.

Granivomus birds, such as red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), which consume seeds left on the surface of fields after sowing, have a high risk of exposure. As triazole fungicides can affect sterol synthesis, we tested the hypothesis that treated seed consumption could alter the synthesis of sex hormones and reduce the reproductive capacity of partridges. We exposed adult partridges to seeds treated with four different formulations containing triazoles as active ingredients (flutriafol, prothioconazole, tebuconazole, and a mixture of the latter two) simulating a field exposure during the late autumn sowing season. All treatments produced biochemical changes and an overexpression of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of sterols and steroid hormones, such as PMVK, ABCA1, MVD, PSCK9, DHCR7 and HSD17B7. Plasma levels of oestradiol were reduced in partridges exposed to tebuconazole. We also monitored reproduction 3 months after exposure (laying date, egg fertilization and hatching rates). We observed a 14-day delay in the laying onset of partridges that had been exposed to flutriafol as compared to controls. These results show that the consumption of seeds treated with triazole fungicides has the potential to affect granivorous bird reproduction. We recommend the evaluation of lagged reproductive effects as part of the protocols of environmental risk assessment of pesticides in wild birds in light of the effects resulting from the exposure to triazole-treated seeds.",2020,189,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109928

We evaluated the effect of the herbicide formulations Clearcast (R) (active ingredient imazamox) and Galleon (R) SC (active ingredient penoxsulam), in conjunction with the adjuvant Agri-dex (R), on the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and the copepod Eurytemora affinis and whether their application in invasive aquatic weed control has acutely negative effects on important delta food web species. Herbicide-adjuvant mixtures were more toxic than herbicide formulations alone. For the diatom, 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) were 84.4 mg/L for Clearcast, >100 mg/L for Galleon SC, and 38.5 mg/L for Agri-dex. In the herbicide mixture diatom tests, IC50s decreased to 2.8 mg/L for Clearcast + 64 mg/L Agri-dex and to 6.6 mg/L for Galleon SC + 41 mg/L Agri-dex. In the copepod tests, 50% effect concentrations (EC50s) were 45.4 mg/L for Agri-dex, 31.2 mg/L for Galleon SC, and >100 mg/L for Clearcast.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of artificial rains on the efficiency of the acaricide propargite in combination or not with adjuvants for the control of the mite B. yothersi. The experiment was conducted using orange plants grown in pots kept under greenhouse conditions. The acaricide propargite was evaluated isolated and with addition of the adjuvants polydimethylsiloxane (20mL cp/100 L of water) and a mixture of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and propionic acid (500 mL cp/100 L of water). After the application of the acaricide with and without the adjuvants, the plants were subjected to a 10-mm artificial rainfall at different time intervals: 5 minutes, and 1 and 12 hours after application. Thereafter, B. yothersi mites were transferred to plants for survival evaluation. The artificial rainfall affected negatively the efficiency of propargite isolated and in mixture. The addition of the adjuvant phosphatidylcholine and propionic acid impaired the efficiency of propargite due to an increased runoff of the broth and a decrease in the deposit of active ingredients on plants.

A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model framework is proposed for the optimal production, distribution and capacity planning of a supply chain of an active ingredient (Al), consisting of Al plants, formulation plants and markets. The transfer prices of the AI from Al plants to formulation plants, and those of products from formulation plants to markets are to be optimised. The proportional and max-min fairness criteria are adopted to define fair profit distributions. Considering bargaining powers of supply chain members, game theoretic solution approaches are developed for fair solutions using Nash bargaining and lexicographic maximin principles. Especially, a hierarchical approach is developed to obtain an approximate optimal fair solution efficiently. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed approaches are demonstrated by two examples, including a real world agrochemical supply chain. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhanced foliar uptake is one means of improving efficacy. The plant leaf cuticle is known to be the main barrier to diffusion of agrochemicals within the leaf. The usefulness of a mathematical model to simulate uptake of agrochemicals in plant cuticles has been noted previously in the literature, as the results of each uptake experiment are specific to each formulation of active ingredient, plant species and environmental conditions. In this work we develop a mathematical model and numerical simulation for the uptake of hydrophilic ionic agrochemicals through aqueous pores in plant cuticles. We propose a novel, nonlinear, porous diffusion model for ionic agrochemicals in isolated cuticles, which extends simple diffusion through the incorporation of parameters capable of simulating: plant species variations, evaporation of surface droplet solutions, ion binding effects on the cuticle surface and swelling of the aqueous pores with water. We validate our theoretical results against appropriate experimental data, discuss the key sensitivities in the model and relate theoretical predictions to appropriate physical mechanisms. Major influencing factors have been found to be cuticle structure, including tortuosity and density of the aqueous pores, and to a lesser extent humidity and cuticle surface ion binding effects.",2017,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2017.00746

The objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of this insect growth regulator against house flies using variety of delivery systems and target life stages, including an evaluation of the potential for autodissemination by female flies to larval development sites. Adult female house flies exposed to filter paper (3.75% active ingredient) or sugar treated with pyriproxyfen (0.01-0.1%) produced significantly fewer F 1 pupae than untreated flies. Adult emergence from pupae was unaffected. In contrast, treatment of larval rearing medium with 0.35 ml/cm(2) of a 12 mg pyriproxyfen/liter preparation had no effect on the number of pupae developing from eggs but markedly inhibited adult emergence from those pupae. There was little difference in susceptibility between an insecticide-susceptible and a wild strain of house fly. The LC50 for inhibiting fly emergence of dust formulations in diatomaceous earth incorporating commercial pyriproxyfen products ranged from 8 to 26 mg/liter, with little difference among products.

Due to the humid and rainy summer weather in this region, the objective of this study was to determine the acceptance and efficacy of water-soaked ant baits on W. auropunctata, some of which had purported moisture resistance. Bait acceptance tests conducted in the field with dry baits determined that baits containing the active ingredients spinosad and pyriproxyfen were accepted poorly, while W. auropunctata accepted both dry and wet baits containing hydramethylnon, metaflumizone, indoxacarb, and abamectin. Laboratory colonies given access to either dry or wet baits exhibited significant declines in workers, brood, and queens with several colonies being eliminated. The results of this study indicated that water-soaked imported fire ant baits could control W. auropunctata, and moisture exposure did not cause baits to become unpalatable.

The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies. Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well. It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior. Methodology/Principal Findings: An improved, automated version of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay with a high degree of trial-to-trial reproducibility was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California. Three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop oil concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study. Learning was impaired after ingestion of 20 mu g organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous. Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop oil concentrates were inactive. Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment. Conclusions/Significance: A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants has been demonstrated here for the first time. Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time. Impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level, as well as potentially many social interactions. Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore contribute to the ongoing global decline in honey bee health.",2012,7,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040848

The translocation between the ears and the flag leaves and the kinetics of degradation may influence field efficacy of these active ingredients (AIs). RESULTSIn greenhouse experiments, only traces (<1%) of the total AI content translocated from the flag leaves to the ears, and a maximum of 3.55% from the ears to the flag leaves. From the treated to the non-treated side of the ears, 3.2-15.9% of the AI translocated, depending on cultivar, AI and time. In field experiments, the degradation kinetics in the first 8days after treatment revealed a higher velocity in the flag leaf blades than in the ears, although both were dependent on the type of cultivar. The fungicide treatment resulted in 42.6-100% decreases in FHB traits. CONCLUSIONSThere is no effective translocation of these AIs, only moderate redistribution in the ears, which can be decisive from the aspect of FHB management. The degradation of prothioconazole was faster than that of tebuconazole.

Partitioning, degradation, plant uptake and metabolism are described using mass-balance conservation equations in the form of kinetic approximations. Estimated environmental concentrations, governed by the pesticide formulation, are described using superimposed analytical solutions for the one-dimensional diffusion equation in spherical coordinates and by a finite difference representation of the two-dimensional diffusion equation in Cartesian coordinates. Formulation attributes from granules include active ingredient release rates, particle sizes, pesticide loading, and granule spacing. The diffusion model for pesticide transport is coupled with the compartment model to follow the fate and transport of a pesticide from its initial application location to various environmental matrices of interest. Formulation effects, partitioning and degradation in the various environmental matrices, differential plant uptake and metabolism, and dose-response information for plants are accounted for. This novel model provides a mechanism for selecting formulation delivery systems that optimize specific attributes (such as weed control or the therapeutic index) for risk-assessment procedures.

This study opens new gate way to manage the over-rising increments of WCO and give safer and green agriculture product for pest management. The goal was also to explore the economic and industrial feasibility of WCO as alternate source to persistent toxic, non-renewable petroleum solvents. So, processed (transesterified) WCO and aromatic hydrocarbon solvent (C-9) based EC formulations were developed and different physico-chemical properties including physical appearance, acidity/alkalinity, flashpoint, emulsion stability, shelf-life, droplet size, interfacial tension etc were comparatively assessed as per CIPAC (Collaborative International Pesticides Analytical Council) protocols using Abel Flashpoint Apparatus, Particle Size Analyzer, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Spinning Drop Tensiometer (SDT). Assessment results proved that WCO based formulation is more stable with brown color, low odor, high flashpoint (282.16 K) compared to solvent (C-9) based with less stable (crystallization/sedimentation), light colored, high smell, low flashpoint (268.46 K). Aqueous oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions of WCO and C-9 based formulations were measured with droplet size (2.6 and 3.5 mu m) and emulsion stability (79.6 and 98.8%). Interfacial tension reading (0.8 Nmm(-1)) in WCO based EC indicated good dispersion with no creaming or sedimentation. Furthermore, stability and compatibility study of active constituents recorded of 1.28 and 50% degradation in WCO and solvent based formulations respectively. WCO based EC inhibited 90% where as C-9 based formulations reduced only 68% growth of Rhizoctonia solani. WCO based EC is also free from dermal toxicity, inhalation hazards and phyototoxicity.

The MARA bioassay lacks published data for many relevant environmental pollutants, particularly pesticides and this may limit its use in regulatory framework. The present study has assessed the sensitivity of the MARA bioassay relative to other established bioassays (Daphnia magna and Oreochromis niloticus) to two widely used herbicide formulations: Roundup (having glyphosate as active ingredient) and Herbextra (with the active ingredient being 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-2,4-D). Roundup was found to be more toxic than Herbextra in all three bioassays. The D. magna EC50 s obtained for Roundup and Herbextra were respectively 5.55 and 356.61 mg/l while the LC50 s for O. niloticus were 11.30 and 222,28 mg/l respectively. In the case of the MARA bioassay microbial toxic concentrations (MTCs) for individual species ranged from 6.85 to 468 mg/l with an overall mean MTC of 101.82 mg/l for glyphosate and from 74.67 to 13,333 mg/l for 2,4-D giving an overall mean MTC of 2855.88 mg/l. Although the overall MTCs from the MARA bioassay were much higher than the LC50 s and EC50 s from the fish and daphnia bioassays respectively, the most sensitive MARA organism for each of the herbicides had MTCs that were comparable to or lower than the corresponding endpoints from the other bioassays implying that the MARA assay is a potentially useful bioassay for risk assessment of pesticides.",2015,24,1915,1922,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-015-1527-4

Japan is a key exception, with pesticide suicides becoming a major public health concern in the 1980s. We here report the epidemiology of lethal pesticide poisoning in Japan in relation to its pesticide regulation and agricultural output. Methods We obtained data on pesticide registration and sales from the Japan Plant Protection Association's annual Pesticide Handbook, National Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center, and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Data on deaths due to pesticide poisoning and population were obtained from Vital Statistics of Japan. We reviewed the registration status and hazard classification of pesticides in Japan and analysed the relationships between the use/sales, pesticides fatalities, and agricultural output. Results Five hundred and twenty-nine pesticide active ingredients are currently registered in Japan, including four WHO hazard class IB organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides. Paraquat was registered in 1962 as a liquid SL20 formulation. In 1986, restrictions were imposed on its sale/use and a 4.3% paraquat ion/4.1% diquat ion combination product registered by ICI. There were 221 pesticide poisoning fatalities in 2019, down from 2648 in 1986, a 92% reduction over 33 years. Self-poisoning was responsible for most pesticide deaths in both 1985 (2013/2476, 81.3%) and 2019 (146/221, 66.1%). Pesticide poisoning made up 8.6% of all suicides in 1985, down to 0.7% in 2019. Unintentional pesticide poisoning deaths also all fell by 83.8%, from 463 to 75. These reductions were associated with reduced sales of both OP/carbamate insecticides and paraquat/diquat but no apparent change in agricultural output across a broad range of crops. Conclusions Reduced use of highly hazardous pesticides and lowered concentration formulations in Japan were associated with major decreases in all deaths from pesticide poisoning and the proportion of all suicides due to pesticide ingestion.",2022,60,933,941,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2022.2064868

A Review,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"Glyphosate, in the history of agriculture, is one of the most commonly used herbicide, due to its high effectiveness and low cost compared to other solutions. Glyphosate based herbicides (GBHs), however, have been the subject of a long series of concerns and doubts, especially for public opinion and mass-media, concerning their possible toxic effects on humans and animals. In this paper, the most cited scientific literature about the persistence and possible toxicity of glyphosate and its formulations on animals has been revised. The different commercially-available formulations of GBHs contain diverse amounts of active ingredient (AI) and formulants. Therefore it is difficult to compare the many toxicity studies on animals, also because the researches currently available differ from each other, not only for the glyphosate formulations analyzed, but also for the animal's species tested, exposure times, for the treatment doses, etc. However, the results of this study, lead to the conclusion that there is a need for further research regarding the mechanisms of persistence in the environment of GBHs, the interference of glyphosate on reproductive cells and organs of animals, and the potential long-term toxic effects of this herbicide on animals.",2020,114,99,123,http://dx.doi.org/10.12895/jaeid.20201.1167

From an evaluation of the environmental quality concentrations (EQC) for dichlorvos in surface waters adopted by different countries, it was observed a wide variability among them. This is despite regulatory EQC-values are typically based on toxicity data and species sensitivity distribution (SSD) in all the investigated regulatory frameworks, and therefore should be similar. Hence, what is the cause of the differences between national and regional EQC-values? And, which ones will protect the aquatic fauna? These hypotheses were proposed to explain differences among SSDs based on the choice of toxicity data: (i) EQC values obtained from technical presentation (pure dichlorvos) will be higher than the estimated from dichlorvos formulation (containing other substances to improve the efficiency of the active principle), as they may include synergists; (ii) different taxa will have different sensitivities; (iii) data produced under different experimental conditions will severely affect the SSD. Regarding their capacity to protect the aquatic fauna the hypotheses were; iv) environmental concentration of dichlorvos represents a risk for aquatic organisms; and v) not all EQC-values are protective for the aquatic fauna. These were tested through a meta-analysis of toxicity data enabling the construction of SSD's across technical and formulated dichlorvos and species of several taxa, and across literature and experimental data produced under analogous conditions. Finally, the EQC elaborated were compared with a meta-study on monitored environmental concentrations. The study suggested that technical dichlorvos increased toxicity compared to formulated products up to two-fold for arthropods. Species phylogeny affected sensitivity, but the SSD derived values used for setting regulatory concentrations were remarkably robust to the inclusion/exclusion of less sensitive species. The SSD results from the literature and experimental data were similar in the case of technical dichlorvos results. The regional differences in EQC values therefore most likely stem from political considerations on how to use SSDs to derive EQCs rather than from differences in SSDs. The experimental SSD defined a protective concentration of 6.5 ng L-1 for 5% of the species, which is according to the European EQC, but one to two-fold lower than the limit values of the US, China, and Argentina.",2022,32,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42834-022-00141-y

Adsorption-desorption, greenhouse bioassay and column experiments were carried out to assess the potential of the SRFs to control weeds while reducing the herbicide leaching losses to deep layers of soil. The results showed that only 6.5 mmol 2,4-D kg(-1) was retained by Na-bent, and the herbicide was not adsorbed by Na-zeol at all. The surface modification with CTMA surfactant, however, improved the 2,4-D adsorption capacity of the zeolite and bentonite up to 207.5 and 415.8 mmol kg(-1), respectively. The synthesized organo-minerals slowly released the retained 2,4-D discharging 22 to 64% of the adsorbed 2,4-D to the solution phase within 7 days.

Environmental concerns and insecticide selection-pressure have prompted investigations of novel, ecologically-harmless substances which can be used as insecticides. This study examined the efficacy of microencapsulated garlic-oil as the oral toxin component of ATSB for controlling Anopheles sergentii populations inhabiting desert-surrounded wetlands in Israel. ATSB solution containing 0.4% encapsulated garlic oil was applied to local vegetation around a streamlet located in the lower Jordan Valley. To determine the propensity of bait ingestion, and assess the potential ecological impact of the method, mosquito and non-target specimens were collected and tested for the presence of natural plant- or attractive sugar bait (ASB)-derived sugars. Over the experimental period, biting-pressure values in the ATSB treatment site decreased by 97.5%, while at the control site, treated with non-toxic ASB, no significant changes were observed. Approximately 70% of the mosquitoes collected before both treatments, as well as those captured following the application of ASB at the control site, were found to have ingested sugar prior to capture. Non-target insects were minimally affected by the treatment when ATSB was applied to foliage of non-flowering plants. Of the non-Diptera species, only 0.7% of the sampled non-target insects were found to have ingested ASB-solution which was applied to green vegetation, compared with 8.5% which have foraged on ASB-derived sugars applied to flowering plants. Conversely, a high proportion of the non-target species belonging to the order Diptera, especially non-biting midges, were found to have ingested foliage-applied ASB, with more than 36% of the specimens collected determined to have foraged on bait-derived sugars. These results prove that food-grade, EPA-exempt microencapsulated garlic oil is a highly effective insecticide which can be utilized for mosquito population control. The relatively short half-life of this active ingredient makes it a suitable for use in areas where repeated application is possible, limiting the accumulation of deleterious compounds and ensuring minimal environmental impact when applied in accordance with label recommendations.

To determine the sensitivity of bog pond invertebrate communities, formulated fenitrothion was applied at ground level with a mist blower to four acidic bog ponds near Lake George, New Brunswick, Canada. Fenitrothion fate and persistence, insect emergence, gyrinid populations, and the invertebrate community inhabiting the floating sphagnum fringe of the ponds were sampled before and after treatment. The invertebrate community was sensitive to formulated fenitrothion. Concentrations of fenitrothion in bog pond water were in ranges that would be expected after a direct aerial application, with no buffer zone, of 2 x 210 g active-ingredient/ha, the operational emission rate used for spruce budworm. Insect emergence was reduced compared to control ponds for 6-12 weeks following fenitrothion treatment. The population densities of Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae were reduced by more than 50% for 1 month after treatment. The densities of most other benthic insect taxa were also reduced. Some reductions in density lasted over winter into the next year. This contrasted with the usual small and transitory effects of fenitrothion on aquatic invertebrate communities in streams or large lakes. Insecticide-induced suppression of aquatic insects and adult insect emergence in the small bog ponds allowed Hydrachnellae, Oligochaeta, and Nematoda to dominate the aquatic invertebrate community. Export of energy and nutrients to the terrestrial system through insect emergence was thus reduced and cycling or retention within the aquatic system increased. Sustained suppression of insect emergence could result in nutrient accumulation in the ponds. Substantially reduced insect emergence would be expected to have effects on dependent predators in the bog ecosystem.",1993,25,170,183,NA

The natural compounds obtained from plants have been more and more employed by cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries and could represent potential alternatives to synthetic chemicals. In the Lamiaceae family there are herbs with enormous socio-economic value, including several species of horticultural and ornamental interest, many used as culinary herbs, and with diversified industrial applications essentially due to their high content in valuable phenolic compounds. This review focuses on the wide spectrum of bioactive phenolic compounds in several species in the Lamiaceae, which possess known pharmacological properties and are used by humans for therapeutic purposes. It also reports other challenging and innovative industrial applications of these compounds as potential alternatives to conventional synthetic chemicals, because natural phenols would have lesser environmental and human health impacts than most of the conventional ingredients used in cosmetic, pesticides and food additives-preservatives industries. Finally, the review considers how an enhanced understanding of the effects of elicitation could be applied to increase and/or modify tissue content of active principles. Chemical or physical elicitors can activate the stress-signaling pathways leading to enhance the content of bioactive secondary metabolites, thus representing a new perspective for sustainable production of industrial crops.

Many pesticides have been developed to control these pests. The surfaces of pests are hydrophobic, so an insecticide in an aqueous solution will be repelled by the surface of a pest and therefore will not be effective. Adding a spreading agent (e.g., a surfactant) will improve the ability of a pesticide solution to wet pest surfaces and therefore improve the ability of the active ingredient to permeate and kill pests. Efficiently killing insects requires the insecticidal component to have an affinity for the pest surface. This affinity was assessed here using the Hansen solubility parameter, which is a quantitative measure of the affinity between two substances. We determined HSPs of mites and cockroaches using Hansen solubility sphere method. The HSPs of mites were delta(d) = 16.4 (MPa)(1/2), delta(p) = 2.6 (MPa)(1/2), and delta(h) 4.7 (MPa)(1/2). The one HSPs of cockroaches were delta(d) = 15.5 (MPa)(1/2), delta(p) = 20.4 (MPa)(1/2), delta(h) = 20.2 (MPa)(1/2), and others were delta(d) = 17.6 (MPa)(1/2), delta(p) = 2.8 (MPa)(1/2), and delta(h) = 3.8 (MPa)(1/2).

Research suggests both Roundup and glyphosate induce oxidative stress in fish and may also cause reproductive toxicity in mammalian systems. We aimed to investigate the reproductive effects of Roundup and glyphosate in fish and the potential associated mechanisms of toxicity. To do this, we conducted a 21-day exposure of breeding zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 0.01, 0.5, and 10 mg/L (glyphosate acid equivalent) Roundup and 10 mg/L glyphosate. 10 mg/L glyphosate reduced egg production but not fertilization rate in breeding colonies. Both 10 mg/L Roundup and glyphosate increased early stage embryo mortalities and premature hatching. However, exposure during embryogenesis alone did not increase embryo mortality, suggesting that this effect Was caused primarily by exposure during gametogenesis. Transcript profiling of the gonads revealed 10 mg/L Roundup and glyphosate induced changes in the expression of cyp19a1 and esr1 in the ovary and hsd3b2, cat, and sod1 in the testis.

The objective of this study was to look for a new control strategy such as application of insecticide-loaded carbon dot-embedded fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FL-SiO2 NPs). Two different-sized methoxyfenozide-loaded nanoparticles (Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-70 nm, Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-150 nm) were prepared, with loading content 15% and 16%. Methoxyfenozide was released constantly from Me@FL-SiO2 NPs only at specific optimum pH 7.5. The release of methoxyfenozide from Me@FL-SiO2 NPs was not observed other than this optimum pH, and therefore, we checked and controlled a single release condition to look out for the different particle sizes of insecticide-loaded NPs. This pH-responsive release pattern can find potential application in sustainable plant protection. Moreover, the lethal concentration of the LC50 value was 24 mg/L for methoxyfenozide (TC), 14 mg/L for Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-70 nm, and 15 mg/L for Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-150 nm after 72 h exposure, respectively. After calculating the LC50, the results predicted that Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-70 nm and Me@FL-SiO2 NPs-150 nm exhibited better insecticidal activity against P. xylostella than methoxyfenozide under the same concentrations of active ingredient applied. Moreover, the activities of detoxification enzymes of P. xylostella were suppressed by treatment with insecticide-loaded NPs, which showed that NPs could also be involved in reduction of enzymes. Furthermore, the entering of FL-SiO2 NPs into the midgut of P. xylostella was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). For comparison, P. xylostella under treatment with water as control was also observed under CLSM. The control exhibited no fluorescent signal, while the larvae treated with FL-SiO2 NPs showed strong fluorescence under a laser excitation wavelength of 448 nm.

The RED document covered 243 rodenticide products containing the following active ingredients: brodifacoum, bromadiolone, bromethalin, chlorophacinone, diphacinone and its sodium salt, and pival and its sodium salt. The U.S. EPA's human health risk assessment in the RED document concluded that it was concerned about the risk to children due to accidental exposures to these chemicals through use in and around residences. With regard to ecological effects, the Agency concluded that there is a high risk of secondary poisoning, especially to mammals, from the use of these rodenticides outdoors in rural and suburban areas. In order to address the potential risks to children, the U.S. EPA initially required several mitigation measures designed to minimize exposure (e.g., addition of dye and bittering agent to formulations, labeling changes). The Agency also initiated implementation of a Rodenticide Stakeholder Process through which these and other risk mitigation measures would be discussed and required as needed. To help mitigate potential risks to non-target wildlife, the Agency initially determined that all uses of field-bait rodenticides containing more than 0.005 % of chlorophacinone or diphacinone were ineligible for reregistration. The U.S. EPA also decided that all rodenticide products labeled for field use (except those limited to manual underground baiting) should be reclassified as Restricted Use pesticides. This paper reviews the regulatory process for the Rodenticide Cluster RED and discusses the response of the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and other registrants to the requirements proposed in the RED document including formation of the Rodenticide Registrants Task Force (RRTF). It also outlines how an on-going dialogue with the Agency, both through the Rodenticide Stakeholder Process and in separate discussions, has diminished the RED requirements from those originally proposed.

Less than 2% of T. castaneum larvae exposed to aerosol-treated flour or packaging surfaces emerged as normal adults, regardless of the pyrethrin concentration. Most of the T. castaneum larvae on treated flour did not advance to the pupal stage because they were either developmentally arrested or died as larvae. They were able to develop further on the treated packaging surfaces, but still could not emerge as adults. T. confusum larvae exposed to aerosol-treated flour or packaging surfaces were able to develop to the pupal or adult stage. Emergence of normal-appearing adults from T. confusum larvae exposed on the packaging surfaces treated with 1% pyrethrin + methoprene gradually increased (range of 29.7 +/- 2.9 to 49.0 +/- 6.7%, depending on the surface), whereas adult emergence of larvae exposed to treated flour peaked at 10 weeks post-exposure.

The global amphibian declines, for example, have been positively correlated with pesticides use. The differential susceptibility in the developmental stages of amphibians to chemical substances are still largely unknown. We examined the 96-h differential toxicity responses of embryos, premetamorphic and transitional larval stage of Xenopus laevis, to six formulated aquatic herbicide products containing the active ingredients of diquat dibromide (Midstream), glufosinate ammonium (Basta), imazapyr (Arsenal), and three glyphosate formulations (Roundup, Kilo Max, and Environ Glyphosate). The results showed the premetamorphic stage as the most sensitive to the herbicides toxicity. This study confirmed that the developmental stage at which amphibian are exposed to contaminants is critical to their survival and that the chemical contamination hypothesis of the global decline of amphibians should continue to be considered.

Based on the recent advances in nanotechnology, nanoparticles seem to have a great potential towards the development of the next generation nano-PPPs used as active ingredients (a.i.) per se or as nanocarriers in their formulation. Nonetheless, information on their mode(s)-of-action (MoA) and mechanisms of toxicity is yet largely unknown, representing a bottleneck in their further assessment and development. Therefore, we have undertaken the task to assess the fungitoxicity of hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) (HPEI), quaternized hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) (QPEI), and guanidinylated hyperbranched poly (ethyleneimine) (GPEI) nanoparticles to the soil-born plant pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb, and dissect their effects on its metabolism applying GC/EI/MS metabolomics. Results revealed that functionalization of HPEI nanoparticles with guanidinium end groups (GPEI) increases their toxicity to V. dahliae, while functionalization with quaternary ammonium end groups (QPEI) decreases it. The treatments with the nanoparticles affected the chemical homeostasis of the fungus, altering substantially its amino acid pool, energy production, and fatty acid content, causing additionally oxidative and osmotic stresses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the comparative toxicity of HPEI, QPEI, and GPEI to filamentous fungi applying metabolomics. The findings could be exploited in the study of the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of HPEI-derived nanoparticles and their further development as nano-PPPs.",2020,165,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.02.001

No data was available for Chinese PCNB products which are still produced and used in China. Therefore, we analysed Chinese PCNB products, including two raw pesticides and three formulations available on the market. In all samples, PCDDs, PCDFs, and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) were detected at levels exceeding Japanese regulation limits. The concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs (0.16 to 0.93 ng TEQ g(-1)) were lower than the PCNB formulations measured from the Australian market (3.9 ng TEQ g(-1)). However, the Toxic Equivalent (TEQ) contribution from DL-PCBs (0.7 to 2.5 ng TEQ g(-1)) to total TEQ was higher compared to PCDDs and PCDFs. This discovery demonstrated that it is necessary to consider the DL-PCBs impurity in organochlorine pesticides and other organochlorine chemicals in particular chlorinated aromatic compounds for adequate risk assessment. In addition to DL-PCBs, other unintentionally POPs-hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (3.7 to 52 ng g(-1)) and pentachlorobenzene (PeCBz) (0.04 to 0.3 ng g(-1)) which are listed in the Stockholm Convention-were detected in the PCNB samples. The PCNB production steps were assessed for their unintentional POPs formation potential. Thermolysis of the aromatic compounds using iron chloride (FeCl3) as catalyst is suggested as relevant production step for (DL-)PCBs formation.

The toxicity of several pesticides to O. lignaria and other Osmia species has been previously reported. However, the field-realistic toxicity of formulated premix insecticides comprised of multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to O. lignaria has not been assessed. Here, we use a customized spray tower in a laboratory setting to assess adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to four formulated pesticide mixtures: thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin (TLC), imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin (IBC), chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin (CLC) and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram (MS) by directly spraying anesthetized bees in Petri dishes. Separately, adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to formulated imidacloprid (I), beta-cyfluthrin (BC) and their 1:1 binary combination (IBC) was assessed using the same experimental method. Resulting mortality in each study was screened up to 96 h post-treatment to determine acute whole-body contact toxicity. In the first study, TLC and IBC resulted in statistically higher mortality at 24 and 48 h than the two other insecticide combinations tested. The CLC and MS combinations were slower acting and the highest mortality for O. lignaria exposed to these mixtures was recorded at 96 h. We did observe significant differences in toxicity between CLC and MS. In the second study, exposure to the 1:1 binary combination of IBC caused overall significantly higher mortality than exposure to I or BC alone. Both active ingredients alone, however, demonstrated equivalent levels of mortality to the 1:1 binary combination treatment at the 96 h observation reading, indicating increased speed of kill, but not necessarily increased toxicity. Significant differences in the onset of mortality following acute contact whole-body exposure to the formulated insecticide mixtures and individual active ingredients tested were consistently observed across all experiments in both studies.",2021,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics9030061
1738,Cecylia,not vetted,"Schluep, SM; Buckner, EA",Metabolic Resistance in Permethrin-Resistant Florida Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae),INSECTS,"Simple Summary:& nbsp;Pyrethroid-oriented vector control programs have increased worldwide to control adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and quell Aedes-borne disease epidemics. Due to years of pyrethroid use, resistance to pyrethroids in Ae. aegypti has become a global issue. In Florida, permethrin is the most common pyrethroid adulticide active ingredient used to control mosquito populations. Thus far, all wild Florida Ae. aegypti populations tested against permethrin have been found to be resistant. Metabolic resistance is a major mechanism of resistance in insects in which enzyme-mediated reactions cause the degradation or sequestration of insecticides. We performed assays to investigate the presence of metabolic resistance in 20 Florida Ae. aegypti populations and found that 11 populations (55%) exhibited metabolic resistance due to the action of at least one of three classes of metabolizing enzymes: oxidases, esterases, and glutathione transferases. Additionally, we identified two metabolic enzyme inhibitors: S.S.S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF; inhibits esterase activity) and diethyl maleate (DM; inhibits glutathione transferase activity), in addition to the commonly used piperonyl butoxide (PBO; inhibits oxidase activity), which were able to increase the efficacy of permethrin against resistant Ae. aegypti populations. Pre-exposure to DEF, PBO, and DM resulted in increased mortality after permethrin exposure in eight (73%), seven (64%), and six (55%) of the Ae. aegypti populations, respectively. Increasing the effectiveness of pyrethroids is important for mosquito control, as it is the primary method used for adult control during mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Considering that DEF and DM performed similarly to PBO, they may be good candidates for inclusion in formulated pyrethroid products to increase their efficacy against resistant mosquitoes.</p> Aedes aegypti is the principal mosquito vector for many arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. In the United States, excessive permethrin use has led to a high frequency of resistance in mosquitoes. Insecticide resistance is a significant obstacle in the struggle against vector-borne diseases. To help overcome metabolic resistance, synergists that inhibit specific metabolic enzymes can be added to formulated pyrethroid products. Using modified CDC bottle bioassays, we assessed the effect of three inhibitors (piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which inhibits oxidase activity; S.S.S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), which inhibits esterase activity; and diethyl maleate (DM), which inhibits glutathione transferase activity) + permethrin. We performed these against 20 Florida Ae. aegypti populations, all of which were resistant to permethrin. Our data indicated that 11 out of 20 populations (55%) exhibited metabolic resistance. Results revealed 73% of these populations had significant increases in mortality attributed to DEF + permethrin, 64% to PBO + permethrin, and 55% to DM + permethrin compared to permethrin alone. Currently, PBO is the only metabolic enzyme inhibitor added to formulated pyrethroid products used for adult mosquito control. Our results suggest that the DEF and DM inhibitors could also be useful additives in permethrin products, especially against metabolically resistant Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Moreover, metabolic assays should be conducted to better inform mosquito control programs for designing and implementing integrated vector management strategies.</p>",2021,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12100866

GHS specifies an alternative computational approach (GHS additivity formula) for calculating the acute toxicity of mixtures. We collected acute systemic toxicity data from formulations that contained one of several acutely-toxic active ingredients. The resulting acute data set includes 210 formulations tested for oral toxicity, 128 formulations tested for inhalation toxicity and 31 formulations tested for dermal toxicity. The GHS additivity formula was applied to each of these formulations and compared with the experimental in vivo result. In the acute oral assay, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 110 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (48% accuracy) and 119 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (43% accuracy). With acute inhalation, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 50 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (61% accuracy) and 34 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (73% accuracy). For acute dermal toxicity, the GHS additivity formula misclassified 16 formulations using the GHS classification criteria (48% accuracy) and 20 formulations using the USEPA classification criteria (36% accuracy).

Thermodynamics study indicated that the adsorption of alachlor on the bentonite was dominated by hydrophobic interaction with the siloxane surface of the clay and enhanced by the binding of the cationic starch. The electrostatic attraction between alginate and cationic starch bound on the surface also decreased the aggregation of bentonite platelets, leading to a more compact structure of the nanocomposites. The higher adsorption capability and lower permeability of the matrix resulted in a slower release of alachlor, which was dominated by Fickian diffusion mechanism. The release of alachlor first decreased and then increased with increasing content of bentonite and cationic starch modified bentonite in the nanocomposites, reaching a minimum around weight percentage 10%, at which the time taken for 50% of active ingredient to be released were 4.4 and 7.3 times that for the release from pure alginate hydrogel.",2022,213,123,133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.05.148

Besides spoiling food material, cockroaches also transfer pathogens of different diseases among human beings. Since the insecticides have been used extensively to control cockroaches, information on their insecticide susceptibility and toxicity at the cellular level may be crucial. In the study, deltamethrin toxicity as well as the deltamethrin-mediated cytomorphological changes in the brain, ovary and midgut of the two important cockroach species have been assessed. Different concentrations [0.00025% (0.0025 mg/ml), 0.0025% (0.025 mg/ml), 0.025% (0.25 mg/ml), 0.25% (2.5 mg/ml), 0.5% (5 mg/ml), 1% (10 mg/ml)] of deltamethrin in acetone were used to expose test species in WHO bottle assay. Knockdown was recorded after 5 min interval while delayed mortality was observed after 24 h. Brain, ovary and gut were dissected post 1 h exposure and 24 h holding (for 0.25, 0.5 and 1% concentration), and tissues were processed for microscopic analysis. Deltamethrin exposed cockroaches and dissected tissues were used to estimate deltamethrin using HPLC. At 0.00025% (lowest concentration), the percentage knock-down observed was 66.7% for P. americana and 80% B. germanica respectively (R-2 = 0.78; p = 0.0001) in 1 h. KDT50 value was found to be 8.7 min (95% CI: 7.3-10.2), while KDT99 was 20.7 min (95% CI: 16.0-35.7) in P. americana at 1% concentration. Whereas, the KDT50 and KDT99 values for B. germanica were 7.4 min (95% CI: 5.4-9.1) and 27.4 min (95% CI: 18.2-80.0) at a similar concentration.

Using an in vitro model of pig oocyte maturation, we examined the biological impact of both glyphosate and Roundup on female gamete evaluating nuclear maturation, cytoplasmic maturation and developmental competence of oocytes, steroidogenic activity of cumulus cells as well as intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH) and ROS of oocytes. Our results indicate that although exposure to glyphosate and Roundup during in vitro maturation does not affect nuclear maturation and embryo cleavage, it does impair oocyte developmental competence in terms of blastocyst rate and cellularity. Moreover, Roundup at the same glyphosate-equivalent concentrations was shown to be more toxic than pure glyphosate, altering steroidogenesis and increasing oocyte ROS levels, thus confirming that Roundup adjuvants enhance glyphosate toxic effects and/or are biologically active in their side-effect and therefore should be considered and tested as active ingredients.",2020,10,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-68813-6

Fludora (R) Fusion is a new IRS insecticide containing a mixture of deltamethrin and clothianidin, a neonicotinoid. Methods: The efficacy of Fludora (R) Fusion IRS was evaluated over 11-12 months on concrete and mud substrates in laboratory bioassays and experimental huts against wild free-flying pyrethroid-resistantAnopheles gambiae(sensu lato) in Cove, Benin. A comparison was made with the two active ingredients of the mixture; clothianidin and deltamethrin, applied alone. CDC bottle bioassays were also performed to investigate resistance to clothianidin in the wild vector population. Results Fludora (R) Fusion induced > 80% laboratory cone bioassay mortality with both susceptible and pyrethroid-resistantAn. gambiae(s.l.) for 7-9 months on concrete block substrates and 12 months on mud block substrates. The vector population at the experimental hut site was fully susceptible to clothianidin in CDC bottle bioassays. Overall mortality rates of wild free-flying pyrethroid-resistantAn. gambiae(s.l.) entering the experimental huts during the 11-month trial were < 15% with deltamethrin and significantly higher with Fludora (R) Fusion (69-71%) and clothianidin alone (72-78%). Initial high experimental hut mortality rates with Fludora (R) Fusion (> 80%) only declined by 50% after 8 months. Monthlyin situwall cone bioassay mortality of susceptible mosquitoes was > 80% for 9-12 months with Fludora (R) Fusion and clothianidin alone.

Conclusions: Indoor residual spraying with Fludora (R) Fusion induced high and prolonged mortality of wild pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors for 7-10 months mostly due to the clothianidin component and substantial early exiting of mosquitoes from treated huts due to the pyrethroid component.

Larvae were exposed to the products for periods ranging from 5 to 180 s. Most products were quite effective against susceptible-strain larvae but less effective in field strains due to organophosphate resistance. Some products killed fewer than 20% of field larvae, even after 180 s exposure. However, field strain and susceptible-strain L. cuprina were equally likely to succumb after thorough exposure to a powder formulation of diazinon or to products containing ivermectin or cyromazine. Most products had no obvious effects on larvae until 2-8 h after treatment. Exceptions were non-aqueous, ready to use formulations such as Kleendok with diazinon, Defiance S and Coopers Flystrike Powder. In the cases of Kleendok with diazinon and Defiance S it is likely that formulation components other than the active ingredient were responsible for the fast action. Of the aqueous organophosphate formulation products Supona, containing chlorfenvinphos, was the fastest acting. Greater proportions of susceptible larvae responded over time but among field larvae that responded initially, there were some that recovered within 24 h.

Various models are available, each usually limited to predicting the efficacy of an individual process. In this study, spray retention, uptake and translocation of glyphosate (as influenced by an organosilicone surfactant Silwet L-77 (R)) on three plant species was determined. Non-linear regression models were used to describe the relative effects of retention, uptake and translocation processes on bioefficacy. All three variables were highly correlated, making it difficult to distinguish their relative influence on bioefficacy. Uptake and translocation were highly correlated (> than 0.98 for all species studied), with about 40-45% of the glyphosate taken up translocated for all three species. Overall the best model, explaining 85-99% variance, used retention and uptake together. It appeared that the bioefficacy of glyphosate towards barley and broccoli was 30-50% related to retention and 50-70% related to uptake, while glyphosate efficacy towards bean was entirely related to uptake and not directly related to retention. For practical purposes, it is reasonable to expect that experimental results from retention and uptake studies (or predictions of each from available models) considered together will give a good indication of the relative bioefficacy of different formulations for a given AI across a wide range of systemic active ingredient (AI) and species, minimising the need for translocation measurements.",2014,1171,111,139,NA

The Gompertz model for log-linear mortality data were used to determine laboratory 48-h LC95 values. As with foreign evaluations, the B.s. formulations were most effective against Culex spp., with the WDG 10-100 times more effective than the CG on an ITU/ mosquito basis. Consequently, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. quinquefasciatus were selected as target species for small-plot field evaluation of WDG efficacy over time. Weekly cohorts of caged third-instar Cx. annulirostris were exposed to replicated low (250 g/ha), medium (500 g/ha), and high (1,000 g/ha) dosages of WDC. Concurrent assessment of Cx. quinquefasciatus mortality outside the cages was also conducted. In water with high organic content, the low rate produced >99% Cx. annulirostris mortality at 48 h, decreasing to 79% at week 3 and no control at week 4. The medium and high rates resulted in 100% Cx. annulirostris mortality for 2 wk posttreatment, decreasing to 95% at week 3, and no control at week 4.

A. Juss) against two serious pest species of stored products, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), through nano -emulsion formulations. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed consisting of an emulsion system of an active ingredient (neem oil), surfactant (polysorbate or alkylpolyglucoside), and water. Isotropic regions were formed in the pseudoternary phase diagrams, and four formulations were selected from the isotropic regions and characterized according to particle size, particle aging, zeta potential, stability and thermostability, surface tension, viscosity, and pH. The selected formulations showed particle sizes of 208-507 nm in diameter. The result of contact toxicity demonstrated excellent mortality of S. oryzae and T castaneum adults, with a mortality range of 85100% and 74-100%, respectively, at a 1% azadirachtin concentration after only 2 days of exposure. Compared to non -formulated neem oil, the nano -emulsion formulations significantly increased the mortality of the tested species.

Chemical control remains the main strategy for planthopper control in China and other subtropical and temperate regions. Most common chemical insecticides are emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, soluble concentrates, and wettable powders. These insecticides are applied by dusting or spraying using simple equipment. The active ingredient, with short effectiveness time, is degraded rapidly in natural paddy ecosystems. Thus, repeated pesticide applications are required to control rice planthoppers. Altering the short-term effect formulation of pesticides to a long-acting formulation may be an alternative solution. A pymetrozine controlled-release granule (CRG; 1%) was developed by loading the pesticide on bentonite and coating the solid pesticide with resin. Analysis of pymetrozine release indicated that the 1% pymetrozine CRG release was more than 80% for 60 days. In the field trial screening, the 1% pymetrozine CRG showed a controlled effect of 61.96-78.87% at 48 days after CGR application. Application of 1% pymetrozine CRG at the recommended dosage and 1.5 times the recommended dosage resulted in terminal residues on brown rice below the maximum residue limit (0.1 mg kg(-1)) of China and Japan. Moreover, the pesticide granules showed low toxicity against all tested beneficial organisms in the environment. Pymetrozine CRG (1%) showed good controlled release and efficacy for controlling paddy planthoppers. The compound exhibited a low terminal residue and low toxicity against all tested beneficial organisms.

Adjuvants may modify the bioavailability and toxicity of pesticides. In this study, the aim was to examine to which degree nonylphenol (NP) may interfere with the toxicity of two organophosphorus pesticides found in aquafeeds, chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) and pirimiphos-methyl (PPM). Atlantic salmon liver cells were exposed to these compounds singly or in combinations for 48 h using 3D cell cultures. Cytotoxicity, gene expression (RTqPCR), and lipidomics endpoints were used to assess toxicity. The dose-response assessment showed that NP was the most toxic compound at equimolar concentrations (100 mu M). Shotgun lipidomics pointed to a general pattern of elevated levels of saturated 18:0 fatty acids and declined levels of 18:1 monounsaturated fatty acids by the combined treatment. All three compounds had a distinct effect on membrane phospholipids, in particular on phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Lipid species patterns predicted inhibited stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) activity and increased Delta 6 desaturase (D6D) activity in co-treated cells. While all three compounds alone mitigated increased triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation, combined treatment resulted in lower total TAG in the cells.

In the present study, we analyzed the impact of five tank-mix adjuvants (three organosilicones one superspreader, one penetrating agent and one spreader-sticker as well as one paraffinic oil and one vegetable oil with non-ionic surfactants) on the amount of active ingredient (Al) deposited, deposit characteristics at the microscale, and rain-induced removal of chlorantraniliprole from the hydrophobic leaf surfaces of wheat and maize. In addition, the cuticular penetration of the Al was determined on astomatous cuticles from the adaxial side of apple leaves. The tank-mix adjuvants with lower surface tension (organosilicone superspreader and organosilicone-based penetrating agent) caused a lower contact angle of sessile droplets, larger surface coverage, and higher Al amount on wheat and maize leaves. Heavy rain (5 mm h(-1)) removed zero to 60% of the chlorantraniliprole from wheat leaves, and 20 60% from maize leaves, the losses being more pronounced in those treatments with higher initial Al amount. Moreover, in wheat we observed a pronounced effect of the rain amount (5 mm or 10 mm) on the Al removal. Environmental scanning electron micrographs indicated the rain-induced displacement of the Al and adjuvants and their partial re-allocation within the droplet footprint. Moreover, the micrographs showed no residues in adjacent areas outside the primary droplet footprint. Cuticular penetration of chlorantraniliprole, which was demonstrated here for the first time, ranged from 15 to 30%, but no statistical differences (p <= 0.05) were found between the experimental groups. In summary, the evaluated tank-mix adjuvants positively influenced the Al amount and deposit formation of chlorantraniliprole on hydrophobic leaves. In the case of rain, the add-on value of adjuvants on retention and Al amount might be partially lost, since the highest wash-off was associated with the highest deposition; nevertheless, the Al concentration on the leaves after rain remained significantly higher, or in worst-case similar to, the control group. In specific cases, the cuticular penetration might be improved, while no information on stomatal infiltration and bio-efficacy is provided. Finally, we point to the need for further optimization of adjuvant-AI systems to increase both penetration and rainfastness, and in this way constrain Al losses and unnecessary environmental contamination.

Until now, most studies have addressed the distribution of active ingredients (AIs), whereas few experiments have focused on the location of the adjuvants. The objective of this study was a systematic examination of the particle distribution profile of both the AI (glyphosate, Gly) and the adjuvants after the application of sessile microdroplets on hydrophobic (Teflon) and hydrophilic (glass and aluminium) model surfaces. RESULTS: The association degree (AD) was surface dependent and specific for the tested adjuvants. In general, the rather hydrophobic adjuvant RSO 5 showed decreasing AD with Gly at increasing relative humidity (RH) levels. The rather hydrophilic RSO 60 adjuvant displayed higher AD between the compounds at a higher RH. A high concentration of the adjuvant reduced the AD for both of the RSO adjuvants evaluated. CONCLUSION: The combination of surface properties, the type of adjuvant and the relative humidity determines the degree of association between Gly and the adjuvants. The present results suggest that the interaction between the AI and an adjuvant determines whether spatial separation occurs, whereas physical processes (e.g. capillary particle movement, inward and outward Marangoni flows and the evaporation rate) are decisive for the extent of the separation. Coffee- ring structures were formed exclusively with the adjuvant + Glymixtures, whereas Gly alone formed either one big deposit or several small islands distributed within the droplet footprint.

Owing to the progressive phasing-out of chemical insecticides, there is great demand for innovative control options. This study reports on the development of an attract-and-kill co-formulation based on Ca-alginate beads, which release CO2 and contain neem extract as a bioinsecticidal compound. The objectives of this study were to discover: (1) whether neem extract can be immobilized efficiently, (2) whether CO2-releasing Saccharomyces cerevisiae and neem extract are suitable for co-encapsulation, and (3) whether co-encapsulated neem extract affects the attractiveness of CO2-releasing beads towards wireworms. RESULTSNeem extract was co-encapsulated together with S. cerevisiae, starch and amyloglucosidase with a high encapsulation efficiency of 98.6% (based on measurement of azadirachtin A as the main active ingredient). Even at enhanced concentrations, neem extract allowed growth of S. cerevisiae, and beads containing neem extract exhibited CO2-emission comparable with beads without neem extract. When applied to the soil, the beads established a CO2 gradient of >15 cm. The co-formulation containing neem extract showed no repellent effects and was attractive for wireworms within the first 24 h after exposure. CONCLUSIONCo-encapsulation of S. cerevisiae and neem extract is a promising approach for the development of attract-and-kill formulations for the control of wireworms. This study offers new options for the application of neem extracts in soil. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",2018,74,1575,1585,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.4842

The most common method of exposure to herbicides is through spraying or diet. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of direct exposure of sperm to 1 mg/L of the herbicide Roundup on sperm motility and mitochondrial integrity. Sperm samples from 66 healthy men who were seeking semen analysis were investigated after written informed consent was taken. Semen analysis was performed according to the World Health Organization guidelines (WHO, 2010). Mitochondrial integrity was assessed through mitochondrial staining using a mitochondria-specific dye, which is exclusively incorporated into functionally active mitochondria. A quantity of 1 mg/L of Roundup was found to exert a deleterious effect on sperm's progressive motility, after 1 h of incubation (mean difference between treated and control samples = 11.2%) in comparison with the effect after three hours of incubation (mean difference = 6.33%, p < 0.05), while the relative incorporation of the mitochondrial dye in mitochondria of the mid-piece region of Roundup-treated spermatozoa was significantly reduced compared to relative controls at the first hour of incubation, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction by Roundup.

We compared laboratory-synthesised copper(II) hydroxide (Cu(OH)(2)) nanowire with the widely used fungicide Kocide (R) 3000, whose active ingredient is nano-needles of copper(II) hydroxide (nCu(OH)(2)). All leaves were treated at rates in accordance with the product label (1.5 kg ha(-1) or 150 mg m(-2)). As a control, we used highly soluble CuSO4. Over the course of the study (exposure up to 7 days followed by up to 20 days of elimination), hornworms accumulated Cu from all three treatments far exceeding controls (ranging from similar to 55 to 105 times greater for nCu(OH)(2) and CuSO4 respectively). There were also significant differences in accumulation of Cu among treatments, with the greatest accumulation in the CuSO4 treatment (up to 105 +/- 18 mu g Cu per g dry mass) and the least in the nCu(OH)(2) treatment (up to 55 +/- 12 mu g Cu per g dry mass. The difference in their toxicity and accumulation and elimination dynamics was found to be correlated with the solubility of the materials in the exposure suspensions (r(2) = 0.99). We also found that first-instar larvae are more susceptible to toxicity from all forms of Cu than second-instar larvae.

It is of public health importance as it is a vector of some human pathogens. Soap, including bar soap can be used as pesticide for cockroaches. It contains surfactant as an active ingredient. However, the effectiveness of low-cost and commercially available bar soap in controlling these cockroaches has received little attention and is not fully understood. This paper reports the effect of bar soap solution exposure on the American cockroach and determination of the LC50 of solution. The research used True-Experimental design with a Post-Only Control Group. Cockroaches were randomly selected from the rearing cage and the post-test measured cockroach mortality after exposures. The soap solutions were prepared in 4 concentrations (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%), then sprayed directly onto 15 cockroaches with 5 replications. The cockroach condition was observed at 24 hr after treatment and the number of cockroach deaths were counted. Normality data were tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test (P=0.05) and analysed using Friedman's test to determine the difference of variance of concentration. Abbott's test was used to specify the effectiveness of soap solution and the LOGIT test was used to determine LC50. The results suggest that cockroach death occurred after exposure and there was a significant difference between the effectiveness of the soap solution concentrations on mortality (p=0.000). The Logit analysis indicated that the LC50 of bar soap solution was at 32%.

We have assessed the risk of commonly used pesticides by rice and vegetable farmers on two major streams in the Ndop flood plain in Cameroon using the PRIMET model. Thirty pesticide formulations were identified containing 17 active ingredients belonging to fungicides (7), herbicides (3), and insecticides (7). Out of these, five posed acute and/or chronic risks to the streams. Chlorpyriphos-ethyl (ETR = 655), chlorothalonil (ETR = 250), and cypermethrin (ETR = 190) posed a definite acute risk to both streams. These pesticides also posed possible chronic risks with cypermethrin also posing a definite chronic risk (ETR = 1658) to fish in one of the streams. Mancozeb (ETR = 2.2) and lambda-cyhalothrin (ETR = 2.8) posed a possible acute risk to both streams. It was interesting to note that most pesticides, including some of those that posed a risk, were applied at lower doses than their respective recommended doses. Differences in ETRs were also observed in the two streams with higher values occurring in the stream having a lower concentration of suspended solids. The higher velocity of the Ngwala-Mesaw stream did not affect the acute risk posed by pesticides.

New IRS formulations, SumiShield (TM) 50WG and Fludora Fusion (TM) WP-SB, became World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified vector control products in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Both formulations contain the neonicotinoid active ingredient, clothianidin. The target site of neonicotinoids represents a novel mode of action for vector control, meaning that cross-resistance through existing mechanisms is less likely. In preparation for rollout of clothianidin formulations as part of national IRS rotation strategies, baseline susceptibility testing was conducted in 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: While work coordinated by the WHO is ongoing to develop a suitable bottle bioassay procedure, there was no published guidance regarding clothianidin susceptibility procedures or diagnostic concentrations. Therefore, a protocol was developed for impregnating filter papers with 2% w/v SumiShield (TM) 50WG dissolved in distilled water. Susceptibility tests were conducted using insectary-reared reference Anopheles and wild collected malaria vector species. All tests were conducted within 24 h of treating papers, with mortality recorded daily for 7 days, due to the slow-acting nature of clothianidin against mosquitoes. Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) adults from wild collected larvae were tested in 14 countries, with wild collected F(0)Anopheles funestus s.l. tested in Mozambique and Zambia. Results: One-hundred percent mortality was reached with all susceptible insectary strains and with wild An. gambiae s.l. from all sites in 11 countries. However, tests in at least one location from 5 countries produced mortality below 98%. While this could potentially be a sign of clothianidin resistance, it is more likely that the diagnostic dose or protocol requires further optimization.

While this paper recognizes the ability of pesticides to reduce crop losses, it also discusses their potential negative effects on public health, with particular emphasis in developing countries, and the environment. The response of the agricultural industry in bringing forward new technology such as reduced application rates of targeted pesticides with lower toxicity and persistency is noted. However, with increasing world population, a slowing of the rate of crop improvement through conventional breeding and a declining area of land available for food production there is a need for new technologies to produce more food of improved nutritional value in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable manner. Whilst the authors recognize that the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops is controversial, the benefits of these crops, including their effect on pesticide use is only now beginning to be documented. Published data are used to estimate what effect GM crops have had on pesticide use first on a global basis, and then to predict what effect they would have if widely grown in the European Union (EU). On a global basis GM technology has reduced pesticide use, with the size of the reduction varying between crops and the introduced trait. It is estimated that the use of GM soyabean, oil seed rape, cotton and maize varieties modified for herbicide tolerance and insect protected GM varieties of cotton reduced pesticide use by a total of 22.3 million kg of formulated product in the year 2000. Estimates indicate that if 50% of the maize, oil seed rape, sugar beet, and cotton grown in the EU were GM varieties, pesticide used in the EU/annum would decrease by 14.5 million kg of formulated product (4.4 million kg active ingredient). In addition there would be a reduction of 7.5 million ha sprayed which would save 20.5 million litres of diesel and result in a reduction of approximately 73,000 t of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere. The paper also points to areas where GM technology may make further marked reductions in global pesticide use.",2002,11,1,18,NA

This retrospective analysis used highly curated acute toxicity data for 503 formulations and 297 AIs. Hazard classifications based on rat oral LD50 values were compared to hazard classifications based on rat dermal LD50 values for the same substance. The concordance of oral and dermal hazard classification was 62% for formulations and 64% for AIs using the EPA system and 71% for formulations and 55% for AIs using the GHS. Overprediction of dermal hazard was 38% for formulations and 32% for AIs using the EPA system and 28% for formulations and 41% for AIs using the GHS. Underprediction of dermal hazard was 1% for formulations and 3% for AIs using the EPA system and 1% for formulations and 3% for AIs using the GHS. While concordance overall was modest, the very low underprediction rates show that acute oral hazard categories are sufficiently protective for acute dermal hazard classification. Use of oral hazard data to also classify dermal hazard would obviate the need to perform acute dermal toxicity tests for classification and labeling and thereby reduce the number of animals used for acute systemic toxicity testing of pesticides.",2019,NA,37,49,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-2447-5_5

We used the zebrafish model to assess the effects of early life glyphosate exposure on the development of cartilage and bone tissues and organismal responses. We found functional alterations, including a reduction in the cardiac rate, significant changes in the spontaneous tail movement pattern, and defects in craniofacial development. These effects were concomitant with alterations in the level of the estrogen receptor alpha osteopontin and bone sialoprotein.

However, essential oils are highly unstable and prone to degradation when exposed to the environment during storage. Microencapsulation techniques help to maintain the stability of molecules in essential oils that are sensitive to environmental stress, and therefore improve shelf life. In this study, the physical stability and efficacy of a repellent formulation consisting of encapsulated Citrus grandis essential oil (CGEO) were evaluated under different storage conditions over a 12-month period by comparing the formulation with a non-encapsulated formulation. The formulations were both stored under two different storage conditions, i.e., 25 +/- 2 degrees C/60% +/- 5% relative humidity (RH) and 40 +/- 2 degrees C/75% RH +/- 5%, for 12 months. Droplet size, zeta potential, and pH value were measured after 1, 6, and 12 months of storage to determine their stability. For the study of efficacy, each formulation was tested against Aedes aegypti under laboratory conditions. We found that the microencapsulated formulation's physical characteristics showed insignificant changes as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation during storage. The microencapsulated formulation demonstrated better repellent effects, sustaining high protection (>80%) for 4 more hours of exposure after 12 months of storage as compared with the non-encapsulated formulation that demonstrated high protection for only an hour post application.

Their ability to eliminate huge numbers of mosquitoes allows them to swiftly interrupt disease transmission, but that lethality also imposes immense selection for insecticide resistance. Targeting control at the small portion of the mosquito population actually responsible for transmitting malaria parasites to humans would reduce selection for resistance, yet maintain effective malaria control. Here, we ask whether simply lowering the concentration of the active ingredient in insecticide formulations could preferentially kill mosquitoes infected with malaria and/or those that are potentially infectious, namely, old mosquitoes. Using modified WHO resistance-monitoring assays, we exposed uninfected Anopheles stephensi females to low concentrations of the pyrethroid permethrin at days 4, 8, 12, and 16 days post-emergence and monitored survival for at least 30 days to evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of repeated exposure as mosquitoes aged. We also exposed Plasmodium chabaudi- and P. yoelii-infected An. stephensi females. Permethrin exposure did not consistently increase mosquito susceptibility to subsequent insecticide exposure, though older mosquitoes were more susceptible. A blood meal slightly improved survival after insecticide exposure; malaria infection did not detectably increase insecticide susceptibility. Exposure to low concentrations over successive feeding cycles substantially altered cohort age-structure. Our data suggest the possibility that, where high insecticide coverage can be achieved, low concentration formulations have the capacity to reduce disease transmission without the massive selection for resistance imposed by current practice.",2011,6,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024968

We evaluated seed-applied fungicides labeled for use with corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and oat (Avena sativa L.). Three corn hybrids, three soybean varieties, and two oat varieties were raised in the greenhouse for 6 wk. Three commercial fungicides containing mixtures of locally systemic, xylem-mobile systemic, and contact active ingredients were compared to an untreated control. Plant development, plant nutrient concentration, and percent of root colonized by AM fungi (mixed species) were measured. Fungicidal seed coatings did not significantly reduce AM root colonization or P content of any plant compared to the control. There were significant (P < 0.05) differences among fungicides in AM fungal colonization or plant nutrient content for all three plants.

Since production fields with water repellent soil often contain areas of wettable soil, surfactants applied to such fields worldwide will likely be applied to wettable soil, with unknown consequences for irrigation-induced erosion, runoff, or soil water relations. We evaluated surfactant and simulated sprinkler irrigation effects on these responses for three wettable, Pacific Northwest soils, Latahco and Rad silt loams, and Quincy sand. Along with an untreated control, we studied three surfactants: an alkyl polyglycoside (APG) in solution at a concentration of 18 g active ingredient (AI) kg(-1), a block copolymer at 26 g kg(-1), and a blend of the two at 43 g kg(-1). From 2005 to 2009 in the laboratory, each surfactant was sprayed at a rate of 46.8 l ha(-1) onto each soil packed by tamping into 1.2- by 1.5-m steel boxes. Thereafter, each treated soil was irrigated twice at 88 mm h(-1) with surfactant-free well water. After each irrigation, runoff and sediment loss were measured and soil samples were collected. While measured properties differed among soils and irrigations, surfactants had no effect on runoff, sediment loss, splash loss, or tension infiltration, compared to the control. Across all soils, however, the APG increased volumetric water contents by about 3% (significant at p <= 0.08) at matric potentials from 0 to -20 kPa compared to the control. With a decrease in the liquid-solid contact angle on treated soil surfaces, surfactant-free water appeared able to enter, and be retained in pores with diameters >= 15 mu m. All told, surfactants applied at economic rates to these wettable Pacific Northwest soils posed little risk of increasing either runoff or erosion or harming soil water relations. Moreover, by increasing water retention at high potentials, surfactants applied to wettable soils may allow water containing pesticides or other agricultural chemicals to better penetrate soil pores, thereby increasing the efficacy of the co-applied materials.

In this research, bentonite and anthracite have been used as modifying agents in alginate-based CRFs prepared with chloridazon and metribuzin. These CRFs have been evaluated in a calcareous soil. The K-f and K-oc values obtained from sorption experiments in soil have demonstrated a high leaching potential for both herbicides, mainly for metribuzin. Release kinetics in soil have showed that the control of release rate of chloridazon and metribuzin was possible by using bentonite and anthracite in CRFs, being this effect greater when we use anthracite as modifying sorbent. Using an empirical equation, the time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released (T-50(soil)) was calculated. T-50 values ranged between 2.88 d for metribuzin-bentonite alginate-based granules and 14.37 d for chloridazon-anthracite alginate-based granules, being the release rate higher in metribuzin CRFs than in those prepared with chloridazon, which has lower water solubility. Besides, a linear correlation between T-50 values in water and soil was obtained. Mobility experiments carried out in a calcareous soil have shown that the use of CRFs reduces the presence of herbicides in the leachate compared to technical products, mainly for chloridazon. We found that one could design a right profile in the release rate of active ingredients from CRFs in each agro-environmental situation, and thus prevent the environmental pollution derived from the use of chloridazon and metribuzin.

To ensure efficacy and safety, botanical and synthetic insecticides must be properly formulated and delivered in a species-specific way to their pest targets. The wide diversity of pests and environments-globally occurring at farms and food industry facilities-has inevitably resulted in a massive proliferation of application formulations and approaches. Although there are excellent summaries on particular aspects of the usage of synthetic and botanical pesticides, a general overview of application formulations on stored-product and food-associated pests is not currently available. This review provides an inventory of current and historical pesticide formulations. Its structure follows the traditional insecticide categorization based on four physical formulation types: gas, liquid, gel/foam, and solid. The review documents renewed research interest in optimizing traditional methods, such as insecticide baits, aerosols, sprays, fumigants, and inert gases, as well as the feasibility of integrating these methods with natural insecticides and physical measures (e.g., low temperatures) as combined application approaches. Several emerging technologies of pesticide formulations have been identified; they include electrostatic dusts or sprays, nanoparticles, hydrogels, inert baits with synthetic attractants, biodegradable cyanogenic protective coatings of grain, and RNA-based gene silencing compounds encapsulated in baits. Traditional and new formulations of natural compounds, including inert dust (diatomaceous earth) and botanicals (essential oils), have been considered as non-synthetic chemical control solutions for organic food production in developed countries and as affordable home-made insecticides in developing countries. The authors hope that the general coverage and extensive photographic documentation will make this review useful not only for scientists but also for students and practitioners. The selective application of insecticides is one of the cornerstones of integrated pest management (IPM) and management strategies for pest resistance to insecticides. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of the traditional and new methods for the application of gas, liquid, gel, and solid physical insecticide formulations to control stored-product and food industry urban pests from the taxa Acarina, Blattodea, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, and Zygentoma. Various definitions and concepts historically and currently used for various pesticide application formulations and methods are also described. This review demonstrates that new technological advances have sparked renewed research interest in the optimization of conventional methods such as insecticide aerosols, sprays, fumigants, and inert gases. Insect growth regulators/disruptors (IGRs/IGDs) are increasingly employed in baits, aerosols, residual treatments, and as spray-residual protectants for long-term stored-grain protection. Insecticide-impregnated hypoxic multilayer bags have been proven to be one of the most promising low-cost and safe methods for hermetic grain storage in developing countries. Insecticide-impregnated netting and food baits were originally developed for the control of urban/medical pests and have been recognized as an innovative technology for the protection of stored commodities. New biodegradable acaricide gel coatings and nets have been suggested for the protection of ham meat. Tablets and satchels represent a new approach for the application of botanicals. Many emerging technologies can be found in the form of impregnated protective packaging (insect growth regulators/disruptors (IGRs/IGDs), natural repellents), pheromone-based attracticides, electrostatic dust or sprays, nanoparticles, edible artificial sweeteners, hydrogels, inert baits with synthetic attractants, biodegradable encapsulations of active ingredients, and cyanogenic protective grain coatings. Smart pest control technologies based on RNA-based gene silencing compounds incorporated into food baits stand at the forefront of current strategic research. Inert gases and dust (diatomaceous earth) are positive examples of alternatives to synthetic pesticide products, for which methods of application and their integration with other methods have been proposed and implemented in practice. Although many promising laboratory studies have been conducted on the biological activity of natural botanical insecticides, published studies demonstrating their effective industrial field usage in grain stores and food production facilities are scarce. This review shows that the current problems associated with the application of some natural botanical insecticides (e.g., sorption, stability, field efficacy, and smell) to some extent echo problems that were frequently encountered and addressed almost 100 years ago during the transition from ancient to modern classical chemical pest control methods.",2021,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12070590

Binary and ternary iso-effective mixtures of estrogenic pesticides at effect concentrations eliciting a 1 or 10% effect in the presence or absence of 17 beta-estradiol were tested experimentally at the hER alpha in the yeast-based estrogen screen (YES) assay as well as in the human U2-OS cell-based ER alpha chemical-activated luciferase gene expression (ER alpha CALUX) assay and at the hER beta in the ER beta CALUX assay. The outcome was then compared to predictions calculated by means of concentration addition. In most cases, additive effects were observed with the tested combinations in all three test systems, an observation that supports the need to expand the risk assessment of pesticides and consider cumulative risk assessment. An additional testing of mixture effects at the hER beta showed that most test substances being active at the hER alpha could also elicit additive effects at the hER beta, but the hER beta was less sensitive.

However, there is still risk of direct effects on non-target species as some insecticides function as hormone mimics, or through indirect pathways as the insecticide is broken down in the environment. Tebufenozide, an ecdysone hormone mimic, is the active ingredient in insecticides used in a variety of large scale pest control programs. An oft cited reason for the safety of Tebufenozide is that it is rapidly broken down in the environment by microbes. We investigated the potential non-target effects of two Tebufenozide formulations used in Canada, Mimic 240LV and Limit 240, on aquatic communities using an outdoor mesocosm experiment. We focus on direct effects on amphibian larvae (wood frog, Rana sylvaticus), zooplankton communities, and effects on biofilm and phytoplanktonic microbial communities that could arise from either direct toxicity, or from breaking down the insecticide as a nutrient and/or carbon source. There was limited evidence for direct effects on amphibian larvae or zooplankton communities. There were small but non-significant shifts in biofilm microbial communities responsible for nutrient cycling. Beta diversity in the plankton community was slightly higher among tanks treated with insecticide indicating a community dispersion/disbiosis effect. Overall, we found limited evidence of negative effects, however, subtle changes to microbial communities did occur and could indicate changes to ecosystem function.",2022,31,1231,1240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-022-02582-y

Mean populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and total aerobic bacteria in the rhizosphere were significantly increased 3 months after the application of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF as foliar sprays and drenches, compared to populations in the non-treated control. In another test, at 5 months after treatment, endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes of plants treated with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF (both from DuPont) were significantly higher than populations in rhizomes of plants treated with three different generic sources of Benlate 50 WP, the active ingredient benomyl, and MBC. In the same test, treatments with the two DuPont sources of Benlate, but not the generic sources, benomyl, or MBC resulted in reduced overall growth of plants, including reductions weight of fronds, roots and rhizomes and caliper of rhizomes. Three long-term experiments examined the effect of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF on populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and development of distortions of frond growth and other symptoms associated with FDS. In two tests at 24 months after application, treatment with both formulations of Benlate increased endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes, compared to controls, in both experiments, and endophytic populations inside petioles of fronds arising from rhizomes were significantly greater with both Benlate treatments in one test where this parameter was measured. Also at 24 months after application, the Benlate treatments were associated with significant increases in severity of FDS, using a previously reported rating scale and by measuring several other parameters associated with FDS. In the third long-term test, the first crop of fronds was cut 24 months after treatment. Four weeks later, the numbers of actively growing rhizomes (that had produced new fronds) were significantly reduced on Benlate-treated plants, compared to the controls. At 6 months after cutting (30 months after Benlate treatments), weights of fronds were lower on Benlate-treated plants than on controls. Characterization of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from inside rhizomes and petioles at 24 months after treatment revealed that applications of Benlate resulted in a marked increase in pectinolytic activity. DNA sequencing of 150 strains of fluorescent pseudomonads from inside rhizomes and 60 from inside petioles at 24 months after application of Benlate indicated low matches to type strains in the ribosomal data base. Phylogenetic characterization of the strains indicated the existence of 10 clusters. Pronounced shifts in frequency of strains in the various clusters were noted with Benlate treatment: over 70% of strains from rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to cluster E3, compared to only 2% of the strains from control rhizomes, and 98% of the control strains belonged to clusters C, D2, F. and G, while none of the strains from petioles or rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to these four clusters. In summary, treatment of leatherleaf fern with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF from DuPont led to a progression of long-term deleterious effects on leatherleaf fern that were associated with increased populations of fluorescent pseudomonads that were functionally and phylogenetically different from pseudomonads from control plants.

Our study focused on the genotoxic effects of two herbicides on oyster gametes and embryos: glyphosate (both as an active substance and in the Roundup formulation) and diuron. France is Europe's leading consumer of agrochemical substances and as such, contamination of France's coastal waters by pesticides is a major concern. Glyphosate and diuron are among the most frequently detected herbicides in oyster production areas; as oyster is a specie with external reproduction, its gametes and embryos are in direct contact with the surrounding waters and are hence particularly exposed to these potentially dangerous substances. In the course of this study, differences in genotoxic and embryotoxic responses were observed in the various experiments, possibly due to differences in pollutant sensitivity between the tested genitor lots. Glyphosate and Roundup had no effect on oyster development at the concentrations tested, whereas diuron significantly affected embryo-larval development from the lowest tested concentration of 0.05 mu g L-1, i.e. an environmentally realistic concentration. Diuron may therefore have a significant impact on oyster recruitment rates in the natural environment. Our spermiotoxicity study revealed none of the tested herbicides to be cytotoxic for oyster spermatozoa. However, the alkaline comet assay showed diuron to have a significant genotoxic effect on oyster spermatozoa at concentrations of 0.05 mu g L-1 upwards. Conversely, no effects due to diuron exposure were observed on sperm mitochondrial function or acrosomal membrane integrity. Although our initial results showed no negative effect on sperm function, the possible impact on fertilization rate and the consequences of the transmission of damaged DNA for oyster development and physiological performances, requires further investigation. A likely hypothesis to explain the embryotoxic and genotoxic effects of diuron is that it may act via causing oxidative stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

When exposed to Roundup formulations and glyphosate, worms endure a suite of sublethal changes, potentially impacting their ability to provide ecosystem services. Roundup applications also impact soil microbes, which aid soil in delivering ecosystem services. The experiment described here sought to establish the length of time needed between herbicide application and earthworm and soil microbe recovery. We found that exposing worms and soil microbes to a Roundup formulation commonly used in urban settings, at about twice the recommended dose, did not impact earthworm mortality or body mass. However, worms significantly decreased their stress-test survival time, and soil microbes significantly declined in biomass after exposure. While worms demonstrated the strongest decline one-week post exposure, and soil microbes demonstrated the strongest decline two-weeks post exposure, both worms and soil microbes recovered by the third week.

Nanocarriers or nanosized active ingredients can be used in nanopesticide formulations that exhibit enhanced stability, superior efficiency, good dispersion, and controllable release to target organisms compared to conventional pesticides. This can decrease the global volume of pesticide applied to crops. Nevertheless, the enhanced chemical stability of active ingredients implies persistence, and the good dispersion of active ingredients may induce interactions between nanopesticides and non-target organisms. Nanopesticides may thus have adverse impacts on non-target organisms, which is often not sufficiently considered by nanopesticide developers. Here, we review environmental risks and potential benefits of nanopesticides relative to conventional pesticides.

The sorption was studied for the active ingredient and its registered formulation Condidor (R). The temperature effect was studied at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C. The addition of a vermicompost from spent grape marc (natura and ground), containing 344 g kg(-1) organic carbon, on the sorption of imidacloprid by two selected soils, a sandy loam and a silty clay loam, having organic carbon content of 3.6 g kg(-1) and 9.3 g kg(-1), respectively, was evaluated. Prior to the addition of this vermicompost, desorption isotherms with both selected soils, were also performed. The apparent hysteresis index (AHI) parameter was used to quantify sorption-desorption hysteresis. Sorption coefficients, Kd and Kf, for the active ingredient and Confidor (R) in the different soils were similar. Sorption decreased with increasing temperature, this fact has special interest in greenhouse systems. A significant correlation (R-2 =0.965; P<0.01) between K-f values and the organic carbon (OC) content was found, but some soils showed higher sorption coefficients than that expected from their OC values. The normalized sorption coefficients with the soil organic carbon content (K-OC were dispersed and low, implying that other characteristics of soils could contribute to the retention capacity as well. The spent grape marc vermicompost was an effective sorbent of this insecticide (K-f= 149). The sorption of imidacloprid increased significantly in soils amended with this vermicompost. The most pronounced effect was found in the sandy loam soil with low OC content, where the addition of 5% and 10% of vermicompost increased K-f values by 8- and 15-fold, respectively. Soil desorption of imidacloprid was slower for the soil with the higher OC and clay content. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

While glycine is an essential amino acid generally recognized safe, both epidemiological and toxicological in vivo and in vitro studies available in literature report conflicting findings on the toxicity of GBHs. In our earlier in vivo studies in Sprague-Dawley rats we observed that exposure to GBHs at doses of glyphosate of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, induced different toxic effects relating to sexual development, endocrine system, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiome. In the present work, we aimed to comparatively test in in vitro models the cytotoxicity of glycine and GBHs. Methods: We tested the cytotoxic effects of glycine, glyphosate, and its formulation Roundup Bioflow at different doses using MTT and Trypan Blue assays in human Caco2 and murine L929 cell lines. Results: Statistically significant dose-related cytotoxic effects were observed in MTT and Trypan Blue assays in murine (L929) and human (Caco2) cells treated with glyphosate or Roundup Bioflow. No cytotoxic effects were observed for glycine. In L929, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in both MTT and Trypan Blue assays. In Caco2, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in the MTT assays, while a comparable IC50 was observed for glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow in Trypan Blue assays. IC50 for glycine could not be estimated because of the lack of cytotoxic effects of the substance. Conclusion: Glyphosate and its formulation Roundup Bioflow, but not glycine, caused dose-related cytotoxic effects in in vitro human and murine models (Caco2 and L929). Our results showed that glycine and its analog glyphosate presented different cytotoxicity profiles. Glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow demonstrate cytotoxicity similar to other organophosphate pesticides (malathion, diazinon, and chlorpyriphos).",2021,9,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.643898

Sandalwood essential oil and its prepared nano-emulsion used to estimate their larvicidal activities against the 3rd instar larvae of Culex pipiens and Aedes aegypti and their effects on larval tissue detoxifying enzymes. Sandalwood nano-emulsion was characterized by homogeneous, stable, average particles size (195.7 nm), polydispersity index (0.342), and zeta potential (-20.1 mV). Morphologically showed a regular spherical shape in size ranged from 112 to 169 nm that confirmed via scanning electron microscopy. Oil analysis identified sesquiterpene alcohols, mainly santalols, terpenoids, aromatic compounds, fatty acid methyl esters, and phenolic compounds. Larvicidal activities of the oil and its nano-emulsion indicated dose, formulation, and exposure time-related mortality after 24 and 48 h in both species. After 24 h, 100% mortality was detected at 1000 ppm for the nanoemulsion with LC50 of 187.23 and 232.18 ppm and at 1500 ppm for the essential oil with an LC50 of 299.47 and 349.59 ppm against the 3rd larvae Cx. pipiens and Ae. aegypti, respectively. Meanwhile, an enhanced significant effect of the nano-emulsion was observed compared to oil exposure in decreasing total protein content and the activities of alkaline phosphatase and b-esterase enzymes, and increasing a-esterase and glutathione S-transferase activities in larval body tissues. Results demonstrated the enhanced larvicidal potential of sandalwood oil nano-emulsion over that of oil.

Control with fungicides or biologicals provides a mechanism to reduce the build-up of inoculum in the short-term while other strategies are being developed or deployed for long-term management. This study evaluated the efficacy of fungicides for control of myrtle rust under controlled conditions and identified adjuvants that would promote spreading of fungicidal active ingredients across the leaf surface. The spread of fungicide on detached M. excelsa leaves was assessed by applying three different adjuvants in combination with seven fungicides. Subsequently, M. excelsa plants were treated with three fungicides/mixes, (azoxystrobin + epoxiconazole, triademinol or a natural tea-extract) at a single rate followed by inoculation with A. psidii urediniospores on day 0, 7, 14 or 21 days after spraying.

A commercial isolate of Metarhizium anisopliae sensu stricto, known to be sensitive to ID, was also included. Within all tested taxa, significant reductions in germination of dehydrated conidia after immersion in cold water (15 degrees C) compared to immersion in warm water (33-37 degrees C) were reported, due to delayed germination and/or ID. Additional tests with dehydrated M. anisopliae and T. asperellum conidia produced on different substrates revealed that susceptibility to ID was greatly impacted by vigor (% dehydrated conidia with rapid germination). Low mortality (1-7%) of dehydrated conidia immersed in cold water was observed when vigor was >= 95%. Conversely, mortality was >= 20% when vigor ranged from 50 to 90%. We hypothesize that, in vigorous dehydrated conidia, the cell wall is capable of slowing down water influx, allowing rehydration of the cell membrane by water vapors before contact with free water, thus mitigating ID. The marked effect of conidial quality on susceptibility of M. anisopliae and T. asperellum to ID highlights the need for production and post-production procedures (drying, harvesting, formulation and packaging) that ensure high vigor of conidia used as active ingredients in mycopesticides with low water contents.

The ivermectin-based product caused a mortality of 100% after 4 h. Conclusions Most Brazilian OTC products did not show a satisfactory efficacy against head lice. Resistance may be present. Ivermectin and coconut oil are promising compounds for topical treatment. Laboratory-based tests should be used to assess resistance patterns and to identify formulations of the active ingredient that increase the efficacy.

In this research the effect of incorporation of sorbents such as bentonite, anthracite and activated carbon in alginate basic formulation were not only studied on encapsulation efficiency but also on the release rate of herbicides which was studied using water release kinetic tests. In addition, sorption studies of herbicides with bentonite, anthracite and activated carbon were made. The kinetic experiments of chloridazon and metribuzin release in water have shown that the release rate is higher in metribuzin systems than in those prepared with chloridazon, which has lower water solubility. Besides, it can be deduced that the use of sorbents reduces the release rate of the chloridazon and metribuzin in comparison to the technical product and to the alginate formulation without sorbents. The highest decrease in release rate corresponds to the formulations prepared with activated carbon as a sorbent. The water uptake, permeability, and time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, T-50 were calculated to compare the formulations. On the basis of a parameter of an empirical equation used to fit the herbicide release data, the release of chloridazon and metribuzin from the various formulations into water is controlled by a diffusion mechanism. Sorption capacity of the sorbents for chloridazon and metribuzin, ranging from 0.53 mg kg(-1) for the metribuzin sorption on bentonite to 2.03 x 10(5) mg kg(-1) 1 for the sorption of chloridazon on the activated carbon, was the most important factor modulating the herbicide release.

Mosquito biting activity was noted often by respondents. They reported that mosquitoes bit both night and day, and that the insects were abundant both in the dry and the rainy seasons. In all 4 communities, a large proportion of the residents used bed nets, mosquito coils, and aerosol sprays for personal protection; vaporizing mats and repellents were used sparingly. The cost of such measures amounted to $4 to $25 per year per household. For most of the residents, this represented a substantial proportion of their income. and was proportionally greater than the average cost of organized mosquito control in developed countries. This suggests that instituting organized local vector control programs would be cheaper and more effective than the individual use of personal protectants that do not reduce mosquito numbers. An assessment of the available products stocked in neighborhood stores and supermarkets for personal protection was made. A variety of insecticidal aerosols, mosquito coils, liquid sprays, vaporizing mats, and vaporizing liquids was stocked. This ample supply of household insecticides lends support to the preferred methods of protection reported by the respondents. The active ingredients in most of the formulations were synthetic pyrethxoids, although a few contained dichlorvos, propoxur, and a few other compounds, Mosquito coils, the most preferred products used by the poor, were evaluated for efficacy, and were found to provide a reduction of 72-96% in landing-biting rates in controlled experiments.",2001,17,153,159,NA

The field trials were conducted at three locations, namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, Philippines. Three application rates (80, 100, 120 kg/ha) of 10% metaldehyde formulation, an untreated control and a reference standard 25% niclosamide EC (1.0 L/ha) were tested during the dry season in a pond with heavy snail infestation. Seven days after application (DAA), snail mortality rates (86-87%) did not differ significantly among the various metaldehyde treatments but were significantly higher than those in the control (6%) and the reference standard (29%). In the field trials, in heavily infested ponds (more than 2000 snails/m(2)), a dose of 120 kg/ha was effective under both dry and wet conditions. In moderately infested ponds (less than 2000 snails/m(2)), a dose of 80 kg/ha of a 10% metaldehyde formulation was effective under dry conditions but a dose of up to 120 kg/ha was needed under wet conditions. In a pond dosed with 120 kg/ha of the 10% metaldehyde formulation, the concentration increased in pond water, until 3 DAA. relative to the initial level, indicating that the active ingredient had dissolved from the granules. From day 3, the concentration declined steadily to approx. 16% of the initially detected amount at 15 DAA. In the pond sediment, the metaldehyde concentration steadily declined to approx. 1% of the initially detected amount at 15 DAA.

Since its introduction into the UK almost a century ago it has become an increasing problem in many woodlands, where it completely shades out other understorey vegetation including young trees, preventing forest regeneration. Climate change is likely to favour its future spread in the UK, and in other regions which currently have a similar climate such as Ireland and northwest Europe. Non chemical management is only practical on a small scale, and to date efforts to control this invasive weed with herbicides have been largely ineffective. In our work we found that a single application of 2.69kg active ingredient (a.i.) ha(-1) picloram [as 11.2lha(-1) Tordon 22K (240gl(-1) picloram)] diluted in water plus the adjuvant Mixture B NF at 2% of final spray volume, applied between spring and midsummer, killed all treated plants within two growing seasons.

The objective of this study was to investigate the droplet size distribution, droplet velocity, and particle drift potential of glyphosate plus 2,4-D choline pre-mixture (Enlist Duo (R)) applications with two commonly used venturi nozzles in a low-speed wind tunnel. Applications with the TDXL11004 nozzle had larger (V0.1)(291 mu m), D-V0.5(544 mu m), and D-V0.9(825 mu m) values compared with the AIXR11004 nozzle (250, 464, and 709 mu m, respectively), and slower average droplet velocity (8.1 m s(-1)) compared with the AIXR11004 nozzle (9.1 m s(-1)). Nozzle type had no influence on drift deposition (P = 0.65), drift coverage (P = 0.84), and soybean biomass reduction (P = 0.76). Although the TDXL11004 nozzle had larger spray droplet size, the slower spray droplet velocity could have influenced the nozzle particle drift potential. As a result, both TDXL11004 and AIXR11004 nozzles had similar spray drift potential.

Its main aim was to develop and investigate slow-release formulations of herbicides (metribuzin, tribenuron-methyl, and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl) of different structure, solubility, and specificity, which were loaded into a degradable matrix of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P(3HB)) blended with available natural materials (peat, clay, and wood flour). RESULTS Differences in the structure and physicochemical properties of the formulations were studied depending on the type of the matrix. Herbicide release and accumulation in soil were associated with the solubility of the herbicide. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that no chemical bonds were formed between the components in the experimental formulations. Degradation of the formulations in agro-transformed soil in laboratory conditions was chiefly influenced by the shape of the specimens (granules or pellets) while the effect of the type of filler (peat, clay, or wood flour) was insignificant. The use of granules enabled more rapid accumulation of the herbicides in soil: their peak concentrations were reached after 3 weeks of incubation while the concentrations of the herbicides released from the pellets were the highest after 5-7 weeks. Loading of the herbicides into the polymer matrix composed of the slowly degraded P(3HB) and natural materials enabled both sustained function of the formulations in soil (lasting between 1.5 and >= 3 months) and stable activity of the otherwise rapidly inactivated herbicides such as tribenuron-methyl and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl.

Resistance levels of WCR adults estimated in lab bioassays were confirmed to significantly reduce the efficacy of foliar-applied bifenthrin. The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of WCR pyrethroid resistance levels on the performance of common soil-applied insecticide formulations (23.4% tefluthrin, 17.15% bifenthrin, and 0.1% cyfluthrin + 2.0% tebupirimphos). Field trials were conducted in 2016 and 2017 in three Nebraska, US, counties (Saunders, Clay, and Keith) where distinct levels of WCR susceptibility to pyrethroids (susceptible, moderately resistant, and highly resistant) had been previously reported in adult and larval bioassays. RESULTS All soil insecticide treatments effectively protected maize roots from a pyrethroid-susceptible WCR population at Saunders. In contrast, the efficacy of bifenthrin and tefluthrin soil insecticides was significantly reduced at Clay and Keith, where pyrethroid-resistant WCR populations were reported. At Keith, where an additional failure of the cyfluthrin + tebupirimphos soil insecticide was observed, WCR laboratory dose-response bioassays showed a consistent similar to 5-fold resistance level to the active ingredients bifenthrin, tefluthrin, and cyfluthrin. CONCLUSION The efficacy of common soil insecticides used in the US for WCR management was significantly reduced in populations exhibiting relatively low levels of WCR pyrethroid resistance. Using a multitactical approach to manage WCR within an integrated pest management framework may mitigate resistance evolution and prolong the usefulness of WCR insecticides within the system.

However, the clinical outcome may be limited by the difficulty of active ingredients effectively penetrating the nail plate. Bovine hoof membranes have been widely used to predict in vitro efficacy of drug products in nail diseases. Many studies have compared bovine hooves with human healthy nails, considering the difference between healthy and unhealthy nails to be negligible. Objectives To validate bovine hoof slices as a model for human unhealthy nails by investigating the transungual permeation/retention of ciclopirox (CPX) through bovine hoof slices and excised infected human toenails after application of a new film-forming formulation (P-3051). To investigate the ability of CPX to achieve fungicidal concentrations in and through infected toenails. Methods A new experimental technique based on a permeation unit allowed analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography of the amounts of CPX permeating through and retained in the membranes. The efficacy index was evaluated as follows: amount of permeated CPX/Trichophyton rubrum minimum inhibiting concentration. Results Extrapolated CPX flux through bovine hoof slices was about 14-fold higher than through infected human toenails, the difference being mainly due to the fourfold higher thickness of the toenails. In toenails, the CPX efficacy index for T. rubrum was positive (> 1.0) soon after P-3051 application. Conclusions This study confirms the validity of bovine hoof slices as a model for infected human nails, and suggests a substantial equivalence between the two models.

Because postmetamorphic, terrestrial amphibian stages are mostly neglected in ecotoxicological studies, we investigated acute effects of viticultural fungicides on juvenile common frogs (Rana temporaria). Tadpoles from an uncontaminated pond were placed in enclosures in 8 ponds with an increasing degree of pesticide contamination in southwest Germany to represent different aquatic exposure backgrounds. After metamorphosis, juveniles were exposed to soil contaminated with 50% of the recommended field rates of the fungicides Folpan (R) 80 water dispersible granule (WDG) and Folpan (R) 500 suspension concentrate with the same amount of folpet as active ingredient and differing additives. After 48 h, effects on the survival, body mass, and behavior were investigated. No effect of the aquatic exposure background on terrestrial sensitivity could be detected. Acute terrestrial exposure led to mean mortality rates of 14% (13-17%, suspension concentrate) and 60% (17-100%, WDG) and resulted in adverse effects on locomotor activity as well as feeding behavior. Moreover, the results suggest that the toxicity of the 2 tested folpet formulations depends on their additives. Because the identified effects may result in severe impairments and thus in declines of amphibian populations, a more protective risk assessment of pesticides is needed for postmetamorphic amphibians to ensure proper conservation of amphibian populations.

For all candidate repellents, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) discriminated between untreated and treated rice during preference-testing in captivity. We observed a positive concentration-response relationship among birds offered rice treated with 2,500 ppm, 5,000 ppm, 7,500 ppm, 11,000 ppm, or 22,000 ppm GWN-4770. Relative to pretreatment, blackbirds consumed 34% and 77% less rice treated with 11,000 ppm and 22,000 ppm GWN-4770, respectively, during the concentration response test. Maximum repellency among other tested compounds was,40% during the concentration-response test.

Maxim XL, one of the most used fungicides in Argentina, is based on a mixture of two active ingredients: Fludioxonil and Metalaxyl-M. Maxim XL exposure induced severe sublethal effects on the embryos, expressed as general underdevelopment, axial flexures, microcephaly, cellular dissociation, abnormal pigmentation, underdeveloped gills, marked edema and wavy tail. As the embryo development advanced, alterations in behavior as spasmodic contractions, general weakness and inanition were observed. Maxim XL did not affect neither the time required to complete metamorphosis nor sex proportions, but gonadal development and differentiation were impaired. Gross gonadal analysis revealed a significant proportion of exposed individuals with underdevelopment of one or both gonads. Histological analysis confirmed that 18% and 10% of the individuals exposed to 0.25 and 2 mg/L Maxim XL, respectively, exhibited undifferentiated gonads characterized by a reduced number (or absence) of germ cells.

Liver somatic index (LSI) of exposed juveniles increased significantly (p<0.05) compared with control, while there was no statistically significant difference in all the haematological parameters of the exposed fishes compared with the control (p<0.05). The results indicate that the chlorpyrifos formulation was highly toxic and induced behavioral changes in C gariepinus fingerlings, while sub-lethal concentrations induced inflammation in the liver but had no effect on haematological parameters of Clarias gariepinus juveniles. LSI was sensitive to the sub-lethal concentrations and could serve as indicators or exposure to organophosphate insecticides.",2019,5,839,846,http://dx.doi.org/10.22059/poll.2019.279504.614

Lemna minor (common duckweed) is widely used as an indicator organism in environmental risk assessments. The aim of this study was to determine by biological Lemna test and chemical methods the effect of glyphosate (GlyPh) concentrations of 0-40 mu M on duckweed, an important link in the food chain. There are no published data on glyphosate's effects on the activity of enzymes of the amine biosynthesis pathway: omithine decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, tyrosine decarboxylase, lysine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase, and the content of shikimic acid and glyphosate residues in the tissues of common duckweed. It was found that glyphosate was taken up by duckweed. In plants exposed to 3 mu M of glyphosate for 7 days, glyphosate content exceeded the acceptable Maximum Residue Level (MRL) 10-fold. Glyphosate accumulation in plant tissues exerted toxic effects on duckweed by decreasing its growth and yield, inhibiting the synthesis of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids, and decreasing the photochemical activity of photosystem II (PSII). However, glyphosate increased the concentration of shikimic acid in the tested plants. The activity of omithine decarboxylase increased 4-fold in plants exposed to 20 mu M of the herbicide. As a water pollutant, glyphosate increased the content of biogenic amines tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and spermine. The activity of peroxidase and catalase was highest in duckweed exposed to 20 mu M and 7 mu M of the herbicide, respectively. The predicted toxic units were calculated based on glyphosate content and the computed EC values. The mean effective concentration calculated for all morphological and biochemical parameters of duckweed was determined at EC10 = 1.55, EC25 = 3.36, EC50 = 6.62 and EC90 = 14.08 mu M of glyphosate. The study demonstrated that glyphosate, the active ingredient of Roundup Ultra 360 SL herbicide, induces morphological and biochemical changes in non-target plants and exerts toxic effects on aquatic ecosystems even during short-term exposure.",2019,209,70,80,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.01.021

Dermal applications of pyrethrin and pyrethroid commercially formulated aerosol insecticides containing the synergists piperonyl butoxide and n-octyl bicyloheptene dicarboximide were toxic to the snakes. The lowest oral gavage dose that resulted in 100% mortality for rotenone, pyrethrins, propoxur, and aspirin was 2.5, 40, 40, and 1,280 mg/kg, respectively; but, when these chemicals were consumed by snakes in bait matrices at doses several times higher than the gavage doses, mortality was greatly reduced. Uncoated tablets of aspirin (150 and 300 mg), ibuprofen (100 and 200 mg), acetaminophen (100 and 200 mg), and commercial over-the-counter tablet formulations of 80 mg and 325 mg acetaminophen were offered to snakes in a dead mouse bait matrix. The mortality with aspirin ranged from 67% to 100%. No mortality was observed with ibuprofen. Acetaminophen resulted in 100% mortality for each of the doses tested.

The structural effects of organobentonites on the interaction with pretilachlor and the diffusion of the herbicide in interlayer space were investigated and related to the sustained release of pretilachlor from organobentonites. The adsorption of pretilachlor was a spontaneous process (Delta G < 0) dominated by hydrophobic interaction with an unfavorable enthalpy (Delta H > 0) and favorable entropy change (Delta S > 0). The entropy change dropped with increasing surfactant loading of organobentonites, corresponding to a decrease in the degree of freedom of pretilachlor molecules due to the enhanced structure order of the surfactant in the interlayer gallery. However, the increase in surfactant loading generally resulted in an enhancement of pretilachlor adsorption due to the reduction of enthalpy change. As compared to the pseudo-first-order model, the pseudo-second-order model fitted better to the kinetics of pretilachlor adsorption on organobentonites, of which the rate constant k(2) decreased and level off with increasing surfactant loading, exhibiting a similar trend to the entropy change for pretilachlor adsorption. The release of pretilachlor from organobentonites was predominated by Fickian diffusion, which could be understood from adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics. The time taken for 50% of active ingredient to be released, T-50, from organobentonites with DTMA loading level ranged from 40 to 150% of the cation exchange capacity of the bentonite was 6-10.6 times that for the control formulation and exhibited a good linear relationship with the relative value of the adsorption equilibrium constant K-a to the rate constant k(2) from pseudo-second-order model.",2020,190,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2020.105566

A controlled environmental system with 100% relative humidity was developed for direct measurements of foliar uptake rates of sessile water droplets at various locations on waxy leaf surfaces during two diurnal periods between 10:30 and 13:00 (noon) and between 16:00 and 19:00 (evening) at ambient temperatures of 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Sessile droplets of 340 and 540 mu m diameter were produced with a single-droplet generator. Stomatal densities and osmotic pressures on leaves were also measured with a cold field emission scanning electronic microscope (CFESEM) and a vapor pressure osmometer, respectively. At 100% relative humidity inside the environmental chamber, droplets remained unchanged after they were deposited on a non-permeable glass, but they penetrated leaf tissues after they were deposited on leaves. Foliar uptake time varied with droplet size, droplet deposition location on leaves, and diurnal period, but varied little with osmotic pressure and stomatal density. An average uptake rate of 540 mu m diameter droplets on a leaf surface at 20 degrees C and 100% relative humidity was 0.401 x 10(-3) +/- 0.063 x 10(-3) mu L s(-1), which was 2.1 times the average uptake rate of 340 mu m diameter droplets. The incorporation of the controlled environmental system with 100% relative humidity and the sessile droplet generator to measure foliar uptake rates of water droplets would provide a unique approach to elucidate the foliar uptake mechanism of spray droplets for efficient and effective control of target pests on specific plants.",2015,58,1017,1024,NA

The structure of the composites was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis and related to the swelling property of the matrix and the release of imidacloprid. Bentonite was subject to exfoliation into nanoplatelets and combined into the polymeric network within alginate hydrogel, exhibiting profound effects on the structure features and release properties of the composites. Bentonite was of good compatibility with alginate due to the hydrogen bonding and the electrostatic attraction between them. The polymer chains were found to intercalate into the interlayer gallery of the clay. The high specific area of the nanoplatelets of bentonite benefited the intimate contact with alginate and reduced the permeability of the composites. However, in the composites with clay content of more than 10%, the polymer was insufficient to accommodate the silicate sheets completely. The aggregation of the platelets destroyed the structure integrity of the composites, facilitating the diffusion of the pesticide. The release of imidacloprid was greatly retarded by incorporating into bentonite-alginate composites and dominated by Fickian diffusion depending on the permeability of the matrix. The time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released, T-50, first increased and then decreased with increasing clay content in the composites, reaching a maximum around a weight percentage of 10%, at which the T-50 value for imidacloprid release was about 2.5 times that for the release from pure alginate formulation.",2020,5,10068,10076,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c00610

Larvae fed leaves after hatching maximized their feeding intensity (about 320 mug/larva/day) on day 2. Weight gain revealed a stereotypic sigmoid pattern that peaked on day 3. Although the maximum body weight of larvae fed leaves was 70-85% less than for larvae maintained on apples or on artificial diet, 100% of larvae fed leaves molted to the second instar 3-5 days after hatching. Our investigation revealed a diurnal pattern of leaf ingestion, and neonates' feeding intensity decreased significantly during the scotophase. We also demonstrated that monosodium glutamate (MSG) increased feeding on leaves by codling moth larvae. Depending on the duration of the bioassay, and larval age at time of initial exposure, 0.05 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml MSG increased apple leaf consumption by 25-60% over leaves alone. The effect of monosodium glutamate was best demonstrated during the first day following hatching. Exposure to MSG also accelerated molting to the second instar. Larvae exposed to MSG initiated consumption of leaf tissue significantly earlier than control neonates. The feeding stimulatory effect of MSG was not observed if exposure to this chemical was delayed until 3-4 h after hatch. The addition of feeding stimulants to pesticides that act via the alimentary tract may reduce the amount of active ingredients needed to maintain the efficacy of these formulations.

We investigated the effects of Roundup(A (R)) (glyphosate formulation) on the periphyton colonization. The experiment was carried out over 42 days in ten outdoor mesocosms of different typology: clear waters with aquatic macrophytes and/or metaphyton and turbid waters with great occurrence of phytoplankton or suspended inorganic matter. The herbicide was added at 8 mg L-1 of the active ingredient (glyphosate) in five mesocosms while five were left as controls (without Roundup(A (R)) addition). The estimate of the dissipation rate (k) of glyphosate showed a half-life value of 4.2 days. Total phosphorus significantly increased in treated mesocosms due to Roundup(A (R)) degradation what favored eutrophication process. Roundup(A (R)) produced a clear delay in periphytic colonization in treated mesocosms and values of the periphytic mass variables (dry weight, ash-free dry weight and chlorophyll a) were always higher in control mesocosms. Despite the mortality of algae, mainly diatoms, cyanobacteria was favored in treated mesocosms. It was observed that glyphosate produced a long term shift in the typology of mesocosms, clear turning to turbid, which is consistent with the regional trend in shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina.

Grass control was evaluated in field trials conducted in 2003 and 2004 using commercial clethodim formulations of Select (240 g/L), Arrow (240 g/L), and Prism (113 g/L), and experimental clethodim formulations of V-10117 (226 g/L), V-10139 (192 g/L), and V-10137 (113 g/L). Petroleum oil (PO) adjuvant was added to all clethodim treatments except V-10137. The V-10137 formulation of clethodim without petroleum oil (PO) adjuvant gave greater and faster grass control than other formulations of clethodim with PO. Adding PO adjuvant to V-10137 reduced activity except at reduced rates when additional PO or nonionic surfactant increased grass control. All clethodim formulations except Prism and V-10137 caused significant canola injury when applied at post-bolting. V-10137, without additional adjuvants, with less active ingredient concentration, and likely a higher adjuvant load has more grass activity at equivalent rates than other clethodim formulations with PO. Tribenuron applied with clethodim antagonized grass control from Select, Arrow, V-10117, and V-10139, but not V-10137.

The effects of surfactants on the foliar uptake of herbicides are complex and only partially understood. The influence of a range of non-ionic polyoxyethylene surfactants on the uptake of two herbicides, glyphosate and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), was compared using three plant species, wheat, broad bean and common lambsquarters. Surfactants of higher ethylene oxide (EO) content provided greater uptake enhancement for glyphosate, whereas those of lower EO content were more beneficial for 2,4-D uptake. Among surfactants of the same EO content, those containing a C-13/C-15 linear alkane hydrophobe moiety appeared to be more efficient for promoting the uptake of both herbicides. When a suitable surfactant was used, glyphosate uptake into both bean and wheat foliage increased steadily with increasing surfactant concentration and reached a maximum at 0.5%. In the presence of a constant surfactant, higher percentage uptake of herbicide was obtained with higher a.i. concentrations for glyphosate, but with lower a.i. concentrations in the case of 2,4-D. In the presence of an organosilicone surfactant, the stomatal uptake of glyphosate varied with both surfactant concentration and plant species. The effect of non-silicone surfactants on the cuticular uptake of glyphosate also varied with plant species. It can be concluded that the effects of surfactants on foliar uptake of herbicides depend not only on their chemical structures (hydrophobe and hydrophile moieties) and concentration, but also on the physicochemical properties and concentration of a.i.s and the leaf surface character of the plant species.

Bartlett) leaf cuticular membranes (CM) was studied as a function of concentration of chlorfenvinphos sorbed in the cuticle. Mobilities of chlorfenvinphos increased approximately 9-fold when the amount sorbed increased from 1 to 100 mu g cm(-2) pear leaf cuticle. From the amounts per area, average volume fractions of chlorfenvinphos in the cuticle were calculated ranging from 2 x 10(-3) to 5.1 x 10(-2). The increase in mobilities was steepest at the lower and levelled off at higher volume fractions. This correlation could be described for the whole range of volume fractions investigated by an equation which assumes homogeneously dispersed chlorfenvinphos. Temperature dependence of mobilities was studied at 17, 25 and 35 degrees C and chlorfenvinphos volume fractions of 5.5 x 10(-3) and 0.12, respectively. Arrhenius graphs were linear for both volume fractions, showing that cuticles did not undergo a phase transition due to the high amount of sorbed chlorfenvinphos. However, at a volume fraction of 0.12, the activation energy of diffusion, E(D), was significantly lower (83.6 kJ mol(-1)) than at 5.5 x 10(-3) (135 kJ mol(-1)) we interpret these findings as evidence for a plasticising effect on cuticular waxes by chlorfenvinphos. So far, such an effect had been demonstrated only for certain adjuvants (ethoxylated alcohols) but not for active ingredients. Chlorfenvinphos not only increased its own mobility in pear leaf cuticles, but also that of 2,4-D in Citrus leaf cuticles. This would be expected if plasticising of waxes was the sole mechanism responsible for increased mobilities. From these data we predict that permeabilities of cuticles to chlorfenvinphos are not constant. Depending on temperature as well as types and amounts of adjuvants, rates of foliar penetration of chlorfenvinphos can be higher if its concentration in the spray liquid is increased.",1996,47,171,180,NA

Restricted to single PPP, the current European Union PPP regulation, however, disregards the ecological risks of pesticide mixtures. To quantify this additional risk, we evaluated the contribution of single pesticide active ingredients to the additive mixture risk for aquatic risk indicators (invertebrates and algae) in 464 different PPP used, 3446 applications sprayed and 830 water samples collected in Central Europe, Germany. We identified an average number of 1.3 different pesticides in a single PPP, 3.1 for complete applications often involving multiple PPP and 30 in stream water samples. Under realistic worst-case conditions, the estimated stream water pesticide risk based on additive effects was 3.2 times higher than predicted from single PPP. We found that in streams, however, the majority of regulatory threshold exceedances was caused by single pesticides alone (69% for algae, 81% for invertebrates). Both in PPP applications and in stream samples, pesticide exposure occurred in repeated pulses each driven by one to few alternating pesticides. The time intervals between pulses were shorter than the 8 weeks considered for ecological recovery in environmental risk assessment in 88% of spray series and 53% of streams. We conclude that pesticide risk assessment should consider an additional assessment factor to account for the additive, but also potential synergistic simultaneous pesticide mixture risk. Additionally, future research and risk assessment need to address the risk from the frequent sequential pesticide exposure observed in this study. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Fungal pathogens infect through contact and so applications of spores to surfaces such as walls, nets, or other resting sites provide possible routes to infect mosquitoes in and around domestic dwellings. However, some insects can detect and actively avoid fungal spores to reduce infection risk. If true for mosquitoes, such behavior could render the biopesticide approach ineffective. Here we find that the spores of B. bassiana are highly attractive to females of Anopheles stephensi, a major anopheline mosquito vector of human malaria in Asia. We further find that An. stephensi females are preferentially attracted to dead and dying caterpillars infected with B. bassiana, landing on them and subsequently becoming infected with the fungus. Females are also preferentially attracted to cloth sprayed with oil-formulated B. bassiana spores, with 95% of the attracted females becoming infected after a one-minute visit on the cloth. This is the first report of an insect being attracted to a lethal fungal pathogen. The exact mechanisms involved in this behavior remain unclear. Nonetheless, our results indicate that biopesticidal formulations comprising B. bassiana spores will be conducive to attraction and on-source visitation by malaria vectors.",2013,8,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062632

Widespread use of pesticide in agricultural production leads to excessive pesticide residues. Pesticide residue problems have become increasingly prominent and caused widespread concern around the world. In this work, a kind of beta-cyclodextrin/4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (CDBD) fluorescent derivative was prepared with 4,4'-diaminobiphenyl, beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and 4 toluene sulfonyl chloride as raw materials. The structure of CDBD was characterized by elemental analysis, fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and NMR and scanning electron microscope (SEM). An inclusion complex between CDBD and the carbendazim was formed and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD); and the binding constant (Ks) of the inclusion complex was investigated. The effects of surfactant and pH value on the fluorescence spectra of the system were studied; and the inclusion complex could be applied to determination of carbendazim residues. Based on the enhancement of the fluorescence intensity of carbendazim produced through complex formation, a sensitive method for the determination of carbendazim was established. A linear relationship was obtained between the fluorescence intensity and carbendazim concentration in the range of 0 and 66.92 mu g L-1 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9952. The limit of detection (LOD) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were 1.26 ng L-1 and 0.079%, respectively. The proposed method has better anti-interference ability and stability, and has been successfully applied to the determination of carbendazim in vegetable and water samples with satisfactory results; recoveries in the range of 98.2 % to 101.1 % were obtained. The method is rapid, simple, direct, economical, sensitive and useful for carbendazim analysis.",2018,27,7148,7155,NA

Insecticides used in mosquito control can help prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. However, it is essential to determine insecticide resistance (IR) status before control measures are undertaken. Only the most effective insecticides should be used to avoid ineffective control and/or promotion of IR. Pyrethroids and organophosphates are the most commonly used insecticides for mosquito control. Here, the efficacy of two active ingredients (Als; permethrin [pyrethroid], chlorpyrifos [organophosphate]), two formulated products (FPs; Biomist [Al: permethrin]) and (Mosquitomist [Al: chlorpyrifos]), and three synergists (piperonyl butoxide, diethyl maleate, S-S-S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate) was evaluated in two Ae. aegypti colonies (pyrethroid resistant and susceptible). Mosquitomist was most effective against the pyrethroid-resistant colony (100% mortality at diagnostic time).

Although useful, these studies cannot describe the biochemical mechanisms of toxicity and also cannot explain the effects of pesticides on natural species. In this study, the toxic effects of glyphosate and methidathion were evaluated comparatively on early developmental stages of 3 anurans-2 natural (Pelophylax ridibundus, Pseudepidalea viridis) and 1 laboratory species (Xenopus laevis). The 96-h LC50 values for methidathion and glyphosate were determined as 25.7-19.6 mg active ingredient (AI)/L for P. viridis, 27.4-22.7 mg AI/L for P. ridibundus, and 15.3-5.05 mg AI/L for X. laevis tadpoles. Furthermore, as early signs of intoxication, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione reductase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotrasferase were assayed in 4-day-old tadpoles after 96-h pesticide exposure. The GST induction after 3.2 mg AI/L methidathion exposure was determined to be 173%, 83%, and 38% of control, and the AChE inhibition for the same dose was determined to be 86%, 96%, and 30% of control for P. ridibundus, P. viridis, and X. laevis, respectively. Unlike the application of methidathion, all enzyme activities showed statistically significant increases on glyphosate exposure Compared to controls. However, these increases in enzyme activities were not shown to be parallel with the increase of concentration. The levels of increases of GST and AChE were determined to be 111% and 31% for P. ridibundus, 13% and 51% for P. viridis, and 15% and 36% for X. laevis after 3.2 mg AI/L glyphosate exposure, respectively. The findings of the study suggest that the most sensitive species to pesticide exposure is X laevis.

In this work, we illustrate a combinatorial chemical imaging approach to study seed coatings at the microscale to link chemical and physical properties responsible for low seed flowability. The local chemical composition was examined using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and at comparable length scales, the local adhesive properties were examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) force volume mapping. The link between the chemical and the adhesive properties was established by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

Boric acid products, formulated as dusts, sprays, granular baits, pastes, gels, and liquids, are widely available to consumers and pest management professionals, especially to control pest infestations within homes. Boric acid dust is commonly used against bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L. [Hemiptera: Cimicidae]), but its efficacy has not been demonstrated. We evaluated the efficacy of boric acid as an ingestible and residual contact insecticide on bed bugs, and compared its efficacy on the German cockroach (Blattella germanica L. [Blattodea: Ectobiidae]) which is known to be susceptible to boric acid by both routes. Dose-response studies of 0-5% boric acid in blood demonstrated that ingested boric acid caused rapid mortality at concentrations of >= 2%, and even 0.5% and 1% boric acid caused 100% mortality, albeit at a slower time course. In contrast, bed bugs survived contact with high concentrations of boric acid dust. Smaller boric acid particles did not increase mortality of either unfed or recently fed bed bugs. The same boric acid products were effective at causing mortality of German cockroaches by both contact and ingestion. We thus conclude that although boric acid is an excellent candidate active ingredient for an ingestible bait formulation, residual applications of dust or spray would be ineffective in bed bug interventions.",2018,111,2772,2781,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toy260

By analysis the effect of fludioxonil deposition to synergism of adjuvants, indicated that fludioxonil active ingredient deposition caused by adjuvants was not the main factor for the adjuvants synergistic effect. Fludioxonil + S903 yielded the lowest surface tension and contact angle, which also implying the best wetting ability. The mean diameters in Hasten + fludioxonil group were much smaller than those in only fludioxonil group (5.39 mu m-90 g a.i. ha- 1, 5.50 mu m-180 g a.i. ha-1), the average particle size only had 3.45 mu m (90 g a.i. ha-1) and 3.94 mu m (180 g a.i. ha-1). And the result of spray droplets was consistent with the particles of fludioxonil crystals observed on glass slides and cucumber leaves.

This study was monitored for 12 mo. We found reductions in sticky trap catches (from 27.9 to 2.6 cockroaches trapped per apartment at the beginning and end of the study, respectively); increases in the percentage of trapped adults having twisted wings (an indicator of juvenile hormone analog-induced sterility); and reduced ratios of nymphs:adults and gravid:nongravid females. For F-1 offspring of cockroaches live-trapped before insecticide treatments, topical toxicity tests revealed the following:resistance to the active ingredient used on the population for 8 previous years (cypermethrin; LD(50) resistance ratio [RR]=82.2), a reduction in cypermethrin resistance following pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide (90.2% at LD(50)), and cross-resistance to chlorpyrifos (LD(50) RR=5.22).

Therefore the seed is treated in the CSFR from the beginning of the 1960s not only against fungal diseases, but also against flea-beetles (R a t a j, 1961). Hygienic, toxicological and ecological requirements as well for newly introduced treatment agents recently became more severe. There are objections against application of dry treatment by means of Lindram 50/35 WP, containing chlorinated lindane hydrocarbon. A disadvantage of another approved treatment agent - liquid Furadan 35 ST (a.i. carbofuran) - consists in its high oral toxicity. This induces justifiable uneasiness for handling. In the past years, the research (H o r a k, 1984; 1988) has concentrated on furathiocarb (Promet) whose LD50 value acute oral toxicity for rat is higher by 3.8 to 6.6 times in comparison with the technical carbofuran (C i b a - G e i g y, 1988; F M C C o r p o r a t i o n, B. r.). Microcapsule formulation of Promet 400 CS (LD50 > 3000 mg per 1 kg; M e i e r, 1990) is especially full of hope. In 1989 the seed treatments were as follows: fungicide Pomarsol Forte 80 WP, containing an active ingredient thiram (80 %), produced by Bayer AG, Germany, rate of application 3 kg per 1 t of seed; insecticides Furadan 35 ST, carbofuran (350 g per 1 l), FMC Chemikalien GmbH, Austria, 4 1 per 1 t of seed; Promet 400 CS, furathiocarb (400 g per 1 l), Ciba-Geigy AG, Switzerland, 3, 4 and 5 l per 1 t of seed. The seed was treated on a treatment machine Mini 'Rotostat' Model 300. The seed cv. Belan had been pre-treated with an insecticide and then dusted with Pomarsol Forte 80 WP. Pot trials were conducted to study the mortality rate of flea-beetles and small-plot field trials (four randomized blocks) were designed to evaluate numbers of beetle feeding notches on cotyledons. Along with it, an emergence rate and effect on the yield and quality of stems and scutched flax were studied. The data obtained were evaluated by ANOVA. In 1990, 12 t of the flax seed cv. Horan was treated at the Regional Seed-producing Enterprise at Chocen. The following treatments were used on Rotostat No. R 110: fungicide Wolfen Thiuram 85, thiram (85 %), VEB Berlin Chemie, Germany, 2.1 l per 1 t and Promet 400 CS, 3.5 l per 1 t. The treating machine was adjusted to the application rate of 395 ml per 35 kg of the seed, thus corresponding to 11.3 l per 1 t. The seed was sown within the Co-operative Farm at Sazavka. The field treated with suspension Wolfen Thiuram 85 + Promet 400 CS was compared with the field treated with Lindram 50/35 WP. The method of evaluation was not different to that used in the year 1989; data were analyzed by t-test. By means of Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation (r(s)), a relationship between time of storing (12 months) and germination capacity of treated seeds was expressed. A pot trial 1989: average mortality rate found out for spring generation ranged from 68.9 to 76.8 % in Promet 400 CS, from 83.4 to 95.0 % in Oncol 40 CS and was higher than in Furadan 35 ST (59.4 %). Apart from the effect of the feeding resulting in mortality of flea-beetles, a repellent effects was obvious surviving beetles avoided the treated plants (Tab. 1). The small-plot field trial 1989: in plots with insecticides, a lower number of beetle feeding notches was recorded in cotyledons (P < 0.0005) 12 to 15 days after sowing - in the period of the highest threat to flax with flea-beetles (Tab. II). Flax germinated and emerged normally without any symptoms of phytotoxicity. In plots where insecticides were applied, a higher average number of plants with capsules (Tab. III) was found out during harvest. With the exception of Oncol 40 CS (5 l per 1 t), the seed treatment had a good effect on some yield and quality traits, e.g. length of plants, the yield of stems and of scutched flax (Tab. IV). Large-scale field trial 1990: By procedure water - Wolfen Thiuram 85 - water - Promet 400 CS at the permanent stirring in the tank, a suspension to be used on 12 t of seed was prepared. An optimum treatment proceeded in the following adjustment: loading with seed - 3 s, application of treating agents - 8 s, stirring and taking out - 4 s per 35 kg of seed. In the Co-operative Farm at Sazavka where the treated seed was sown, no statistically significant differences among treatments were found out (Tab. V). The germination capacity of seeds treated with Promet 400 CS + Wolfen Thiuram 85 was slightly but statistically insignificantly reduced (r(s) = -0.155; - - 0.023). This reduction was more obvious in untreated variant (r(s) = -0.511; -0.608; P < 0.05, Fig. 1). The treated seed can be therefore stored minimum for 12 months.",1992,38,115,132,NA

Formulated active ingredients (AIs) were diluted in water and applied onto filter paper in experimental chambers with ten unsexed adult mites in six replicates. Mite mortality was checked after 24 h. The security index (SI) was calculated for all of the AIs by dividing the recommended rate by the LD90 determined for each species. RESULTS: The tested organophosphates had high LD9(0) and low SI values. The single-compound pyrethroids were ineffective (deltamethrin and beta-cyfluthrin) or had high LD90 and low SI values (cyphenothrin, permethrin, pyrethrum and bifenthrin). The multicompound miticides had low LD90 and high SI values which increased from deltamethrin/S-bioallethrin to permethrin/S-bioallethrin/piperonylbutoxide topermethrin/pyriproxyfen/benzylbenzoate. Abamectin, pyridaben, propargite and flufenoxuron were highly active against Dermatophagoides spp. Neem (Acarosan duo) was highly active against all mite species tested. CONCLUSION: The available formulations of multicompound pyrethroids (permethrin/S-bioallethrin/piperonyl butoxide, permethrin/pyriproxyfen/benzyl benzoate), benzyl benzoate, neem and some field acaricides are effective in suppression of synanthropic mites in laboratory assays. Their LD90 are lower than those of traditionally used organophosphates or single-compound pyrethroid formulations.

1842,Cecylia,not vetted,"Xie, N; Gross, AD",Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation synergizes the knockdown and toxicity of GABA-gated chloride channel insecticides,PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND Pest management requires continual identification of new physiological targets and strategies to control pests affecting agriculture and public/animal health. We propose the muscarinic system as a target for agrochemicals because of its physiological importance. Unlike the muscarinic system, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors are an established insecticide target. Here, we investigated target-site synergism using small molecule probes (agonist and antagonist) against the muscarinic system and their ability to enhance the toxicity of GABAergic insecticides in Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen). RESULTS Oral delivery of pilocarpine (muscarinic agonist) enhanced the toxicity of dieldrin, fipronil, and lindane, resulting in synergist ratios (SRs) between 4-32-fold (orally delivered) or between 2-67-fold when insecticides were topically applied. The synergism between pilocarpine and the GABA-insecticides was greater than the synergism observed with atropine (muscarinic antagonist), and was greater, or comparable, to the synergism observed with the metabolic inhibitor piperonyl butoxide. In addition to lethality, pilocarpine increased the knockdown of lindane. The mechanism of synergism was also investigated in the central nervous system using extracellular electrophysiology, where pilocarpine (3 mu mo/L) lowered the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of lindane from 1.3 (0.86-1.98) mu mol/L to 0.17 (0.14-0.21) mu mol/L and fipronil's IC50 from 2.2 (1.54-3.29) mu mol/L to 0.56 (0.40-0.77) mu mol/L. CONCLUSION Convergence of the cellular function between the muscarinic and GABAergic systems enhanced the insecticidal activity of GABA receptor blocking insecticides through the modulation of the central nervous system (CNS). The future impact of the findings could be the reduction of the active ingredient needed in a formulation with the development of muscarinic synergists. (c) 2022 The Authors.

Nevertheless, questions on safety of glyphosate-based herbicides are periodically raised and recent studies indicate that glyphosate may not be as safe as assumed, mostly due to the additives/surfactants in its formulations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of isopropylamine salt of glyphosate and two glyphosate-based herbicides, Roundup Max (TM) (containing surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine, POEA) and Roundup Quick (TM) (without POEA), on non-target species. Special focus was on the evaluation of long-term effects of high concentrations (simulating accidental pollution, e.g. transportation spills) of glyphosate formulations on soil health. Laboratory ecotoxicity testing was conducted with (i) two aquatic organisms - crustaceans Daphnia magna and marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, (ii) five bacterial strains (Escherichia coli MG1655, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and three bacterial isolates from the soil) and (iii) terrestrial plants Raphanus sativus and Hordeum vulgare. Laboratory toxicity results showed that among the non-target test species, D. magna and V. fischeri were the most sensitive to glyphosate formulations: acute EC50 values ranged from 4 to 49 mg L-1. Direct relation between the toxicity of the tested formulations and the presence/absence of the surfactant POEA was not evident. Long-term outdoor experiments (April to September 2012) showed that the number of heterotrophic microbes in Roundup-spiked (up to 1000-fold the recommended field rate) soils during two months after the treatment were significantly higher than in the control soils, especially in case of Roundup Quick (TM). Residual toxicity of the treated soils to terrestrial plants decreased more rapidly in Roundup Quick-spiked soils. It was shown that in temperate climate conditions the recovery of soil health in case of (accidental) pollution by glyphosate formulations is slow and may even exceed the duration of the vegetation period.

A flowable concentrate of B. thuringiensis morrisoni strain tenebrionis (Bt) (Novodor (R) FC) and a wettable powder of B. bassiana strain GHA (Bb) (Mycotrol (R) 22WP) were applied against CPB larval populations infesting potato in field plots. Novodor FC and an oil-dispersion formulation of Bb (Mycotrol ES) were applied against second-instar CPB larvae on potted potato plants in greenhouse tests under low relative humidity (RH), variable-temperature conditions. Each pathogen was applied alone and in combination (tank mixed) with the other pathogen. In the field tests, each biopesticide was also combined with the spray-carrier (formulation without active ingredient) of the other pathogen. Results from the greenhouse tests showed that under warm, dry conditions, low activity of Mycotrol was counterbalanced by high activity of the Novodor, and under cool, somewhat more humid conditions, low Novodor activity was balanced by high activity of Mycotrol, with the result being a constant level of synergism (CPB mortality ca. 20 percentage points higher than predicted by independent action). Similar levels of synergism were observed under the markedly different conditions of the field and greenhouse environments, and the synergism was confirmed as arising from interaction of the two micobes, as the Bt spray carrier had no significant effect on efficacy of the Mycotrol product and the Bb spray carrier had no effect on the efficacy of Novodor. The great capacity of these two control agents to act in concert to control CPB is well documented (the fast-acting, toxic Bt acting to protect potato crops from defoliation and the slow-acting Bb reducing survival to the adult stage). These finding further underscore the strong complementary action of these agents applied jointly against CPB. Published by Elsevier Inc.",2017,144,47,57,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2017.01.007

Suicidal or accidental overdose of OP can result in acute tubular necrosis. Experimental evidence shows little correlation between the renal tubular necrosis and the degree of OF-induced acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the main mechanism of OP's toxicity, suggesting the involvement of alternate mechanisms. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known mediators of many toxin-induced renal injuries, this study was conducted to investigate whether ROS play a role in Bidrin(R) (BD)-induced renal tubular epithelial cell (LLC-PK1) toxicity. ED is an OP insecticide formulation with dicrotophos as the active ingredient. LLC-PK1 cell death, determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (% of total), rose concentration- and time-dependently after exposure of the cells to 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, and 2000 ppm of ED for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Antioxidants 2-methylaminochroman (2-MAC; 0.3 to 2.5 mu M) and desferrioxamine (DFO: 0.25 to 2 mM) reduced cell damage induced by 1250 ppm of ED over a 24-h incubation in a concentration-related manner. The greatest reductions in % LDH were produced by DFO 2 mM and 2-MAC 2.5 mu M, both significantly lower than ED alone. H2O2 levels (mu mol/mg protein per h) were significantly elevated after exposure to 1250 ppm of ED. Significantly increased malondialdehyde formation (nmol/mg protein) compared with control was also found in ED-exposed cells indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation. Malondialdehyde generation was significantly suppressed by 2-MAC and DFO. These results demonstrate that the organophosphate ED can cause direct tubular cytotoxicity, and implicate, at least in part, a role for ROS and accompanying lipid peroxidation in cytotoxicity. Based on these direct in vitro findings, it is hypothesized that, besides hypotension that often accompanies OP intoxication, OP-induced oxidative stress at the tubular level may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute tubular necrosis.",1999,10,1746,1752,NA

II: Agriculturally relevant exposures to Roundup WeatherMaxe (R) and Vision (R) under laboratory conditions",AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are currently the most commonly used herbicides in the world. They have been shown to affect survival, growth, development and sexual differentiation of tadpoles under chronic laboratory exposures but this has not been investigated under more environmentally realistic conditions. The purpose of this study is (1) to determine if an agriculturally relevant exposure to Roundup WeatherMax (R), a relatively new and understudied formulation, influences the development of wood frog tadpoles (Lithobates sylvaticus) through effects on the mRNA levels of genes involved in the control of metamorphosis; (2) to compare results to the well-studied Vision (R) formulation (containing the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate [IPA] and polyethoxylated tallowamine [POEA] surfactant) and to determine which ingredient(s) in the formulations are responsible for potential effects on development; and (3) to compare results to recent field studies that used a similar experimental design. In the present laboratory study, wood frog tadpoles were exposed to an agriculturally relevant application (i.e., two pulses) of Roundup WeatherMax (R) and Vision (R) herbicides as well as the active ingredient (IPA) and the POEA surfactant of Vision (R). Survival, development, growth, sex ratios and mRNA levels of genes involved in tadpole metamorphosis were measured. Results show that Roundup WeatherMax (R) (2.89 mg acid equivalent (a.e.)/L) caused 100% mortality after the first pulse. Tadpoles treated with a lower concentration of Roundup WeatherMax (R) (0.21 mg a.e./L) as well as Vision (R) (2.89 mg a.e./L), IPA and POEA had an increased condition factor (based on length and weight measures in the tadpoles) relative to controls at Gosner stage (Gs) 36/38. At Gs42, tadpoles treated with IPA and POEA had a decreased condition factor. Also at Gs42, the effect on condition factor was dependent on the sex of tadpoles and significant treatment effects were only detected in males. In most cases, treatment reduced the normal mRNA increase of key genes controlling development in tadpoles between Gs37 and Gs42, such as genes encoding thyroid hormone receptor beta in brain, glucocorticoid receptor in tail and deiodinase enzyme in brain and tail. We conclude that glyphosate-based herbicides have the potential to alter mRNA profiles during metamorphosis. However, studies in natural systems have yet to replicate these negative effects, which highlight the need for more ecologically relevant studies for risk assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A review of the literature was undertaken to determine the environmental fate and effects of Bayluscide. Niclosamide (2', 5-dichloro-4'-nitrosalicylanilide), the active ingredient of Bayluscide, degrades rapidly in natural water and sediment systems, however, the rate of degradation is very slow in autoclaved samples. This difference suggests that degradation under laboratory conditions is dependent on microbial activity and hydrolysis plays a minor role in degradation of niclosamide. The major degradation product of niclosamide has been reported to be aminoniclosamide (2',5-dichloro-4'-aminosalicylanilide), which represented more than 50% of the residues extractable from sediments. Significantly more of the chemical is adsorbed to sediments with higher organic content and at lower pH's. The mobility of niclosamide in soil can be characterized as slight to medium; the estimated leaching distance would range from 0 to > 25 cm depending on the soil type and pH. The active ingredient of Bayluscide (niclosamide) is decomposed by ultra-violet light depending on the intensity and duration of the exposure. The uptake of residues by most invertebrates exposed to C-14-niclosamide is fairly rapid and equilibrium is reached within 24 h. About 90% of the accumulated residues were lost within 48 h after the organisms were transferred to clean flowing water. As with invertebrates, fish rapidly accumulate and eliminate residues of niclosamide. Three distinct residues were isolated from the extracts of edible fillet tissue; parent niclosamide, the glucuronide conjugate of niclosamide, and the sulfate ester of niclosamide. Aquatic plants and agricultural crops do not appear to be adversely affected at concentrations of Bayluscide used for lamprey or snail control. Mayflies (Hexagenia sp.). tend to be susceptible to TFM, but are relatively resistant to the effects of exposure to Bayluscide. Bayluscide was originally developed as a molluscicide to eliminate snails. Therefore, it is not surprising that mollusks are extremely sensitive to Bayluscide. Oral, dermal, and ocular administration of Bayluscide to mammals resulted in no clinical signs of systemic toxicity. Tests of the chronic effects of Bayluscide indicated that it is not mutagenic or carcinogenic. Bayluscide is not persistent in the environment; it breaks down in natural water and sediment systems through hydrolysis, photolysis, and microbial degradation. Given the limited use and tight control maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service during applications of lampricides, Bayluscide presents minimal risk to human health and safety of the environment.",2003,29,475,492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70509-7

The basic formulation [sodium alginate (1.61%)-carbofuran (0.59%)-water] was modified by addition of sorbents. The effect on carbofuran release rate, caused by the incorporation of natural and acid-treated bentonite (0.5 and 1.0 hf H2SO4) in alginate formulation, was studied by immersion of the granules in water under shaking. The time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, t(50), was longer for those formulations containing natural bentonite (6.1 h) or acid-treated bentonite (9.0 and 11.7 h for 0.5 and 1.0 hi H2SO4 treatments, respectively) than for the preparation without bentonite (4.7 h). It appears from the results that the release of carbofuran from the various formulations is controlled by a diffusion mechanism according to the n values obtained, which were close to 0.5 in all cases. The mobility of carbofuran from alginate-based CR formulations was investigated by using soil columns packed with a clay soil (53% clay and 0.08% organic matter). Two alginate-based CR formulations containing natural bentonite or acid-treated bentonite (0.5 M H2SO4) were compared to technical grade carbofuran. The use of alginate-based CR formulations resulted in a reduction of the leached amount of carbofuran compared with the total amount of pesticide leached using the technical product (50 and 75% for CR granules containing natural and acid-treated bentonite, respectively). Alginate-bentonite CR formulations might be efficient systems for reducing carbofuran leaching in clay soils, which would reduce the risk of groundwater pollution.",2000,48,938,943,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf981296j

Very few formulations containing only one active ingredient (carbendazim, cyproconazole or epoxyconazole) or combinations of two (carbendazim + cyproconazole, carbendazim + hexaconazole) were harmless to A. rhopalosiphi in the glass-plate tests. There was no apparent synergism between fungicides tested in combinations. The parasitoid mortalities in tests carried out on plants were less and chlorothalonil, epoxyconazole, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, flusilazole, flutriafol, prochloraz, tebuconazole, tridemorph and a number of combinations (carbendazim + flutriafol, chlorothalonil + cyproconazole, epoxyconazole + tridemorph, chlorothalonil + hexaconazole, chlorothalonil + flutriafol, cyproconazole + prochloraz, epoxyconazole + fenpropimorph, fenpropimorph + propiconazole, propiconazole + tridemorph, triadimenol + tridemorph) were harmless or only slightly harmful to the aphid parasitoid.

The parasitoid mortalities were less on plants than on glass plates but the wasps spent less time on treated leaves and in some cases parasitism of aphids was reduced to a large extent. These results suggest that in addition to study of the direct effects of pesticides on beneficial insects (mortalities, reduction of fertility) their effects an the behaviour of the insects should also be studied. Products that induced a repellent effect need further testing in field or semi-field conditions. However, many fungicide combinations that have little or no effect on A. rhopalosiphi can protect wheat against a wide range of diseases and the results obtained in this study indicate that an appropriate and effective protection of wheat at earing growth stage can be achieved with products that have no effects on aphid parasitoids.",1999,123,217,223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0418.1999.00339.x

Applications of either amine endothall or dipotassium endothall were made in the austral winter of 2017 (June-July), in ponded irrigation canals during the irrigation off-season. The target concentrations were 2.4 mg acid equivalent (ae)L-1 for amine endothall and 4.8 mg active ingredient (a.i.) L-1. for dipotassium endothall, with an exposure period of 3-10 wk. Reference pools, with no herbicide, were selected upstream of pools receiving herbicide or in adjacent canals. Restricted maximum-likelihood models were developed that showed both endothall formulations were effective at reducing ribbon weed percent volume occupied, stem length, and relative frequency in irrigation canal pools compared to untreated ribbon weed in the reference pools. Regrowth was greater in the pools treated with amine endothall than those treated with dipotassium endothall. These responses were consistent across the three irrigation areas and lasted for at least 33 wk of the 40-wk irrigation season. Floating pondweed abundance was also reduced substantially after the application of endothall, over the same period. We conclude that effective control of these submersed weeds in irrigation canals 1) can be achieved using the winter-use pattern, 2) can be achieved with either formulation of endothall (thus allowing the ecologically safer dipotassium endothall to be used), 3) can be achieved at operational scales, 4) is consistent across multiple geographic locations, and 5) lasts at least a full irrigation season.",2022,60,39,47,NA

Pheromone response by male C. fraxinella was not affected by the presence of permethrin as equal numbers of males were captured in traps baited with the attracticide formulation with and without permethrin. Attraction to the attracticide containing both pheromone and insecticide active ingredients did not vary with dose as 10, 50, and 100 mg droplets of the formulation attracted similar numbers of male moths in a field experiment. Equal numbers of male moths were captured in traps baited with droplets that had aged for 0-5 weeks in a laboratory fume hood before deployment in the field. The permethrin constituent of the attracticide formulation was toxic to male moths treated through tarsal contact and resulted in 73 and 100% mortality at 24 and 72 h post-treatment, respectively. Leg autotomy occurred in over 80% of males 24 h post-treatment to formulations containing permethrin. Mortality of moths was greater 24 h after treatment with a fresh attracticide source as compared to a 5-week-old source.

Growth was more strongly reduced in sterile synthetic media and less reduced in sterile soil; in unsterile soil only a transient growth reduction was detectable. Sensitivity was also observed in five out of eight other species analysed. In all sensitive species tested, spontaneous resistances to PT occurred. Under sterile conditions, PTT and PT reduced rhizobial nodulation rates of PT-resistant alfalfa plants drastically; however, nitrogen fixation in the few nodules that arose was unaffected. Because of the small number of nodules, the overall fixation rate was strongly diminished. In unsterile soil, nodulation and nitrogen fixation rates were not changed, possibly because of the rapid degradation of PTT and PT in the soil. Using a herbicide as model substance it could be demonstrated that the sensitivity of R. meliloti to chemical additives in the soil can be detected by analysing its growth rate, and that even a weak impact carl influence its nodulation capacity.

Research also indicates that the additives within certain glyphosate formulations, such as surfactants, are actually more toxic than the glyphosate active ingredient alone. Concerns arise in particular when glyphosate formulations are proposed for vegetation control in areas inhabited by rare or threatened species. Although the effect of glyphosate on birds and mammals is well studied, reptiles remain neglected in ecotoxicological studies. We investigated whether dermal exposure to two different commercial glyphosate formulations affected performance measures in the New Zealand common skink (Oligosoma polychroma).

1857,Cecylia,not vetted,"Pauluhn, J",Hazard identification and risk assessment of pyrethroids in the indoor environment,TOXICOLOGY LETTERS,"Household insecticide products raise several important considerations concerning safety. These are related to the use of insecticides by untrained individuals, the difficulty of controlling the use of these products once purchased by the consumer and the potential exposure of the very young and very old, possibly with or without pre-existing pulmonary disease. Exposure to pyrethroids contained in mats or vaporizers, being slow release systems, have particular potential for long-term low-level exposure whilst for foggers, spray-cans or sprayed formulations the short-term high-level exposures may be of more concern. According to the volatility of the active ingredient contained in the household insecticide, its persistence in a non-inhalable matrix, i.e. sedimented house dust, may be short or long for highly volatile or low volatile active ingredients, respectively. On the other hand, the potential of exposure is apparently just reciprocal. This demonstrates that the extent and duration of exposure may be highly product-specific. Accordingly, the extent of exposure has to be accounted for and for risk assessment both concentration-dependent (e.g. sensory irritation) as well as concentration x time (= dose) related effects have to be considered and addressed in adequate bioassays. The issue as to whether pyrethroids adhering to house dust is of concern has been addressed in a model study using carpets treated with pyrethroids. This study has demonstrated that the total mass of pyrethroid applied to the carpet and that brushed off within an 18-h period is too small to be of any relevance for risk assessment. Therefore, assessment of health hazards in the indoor environment based simply on methodologies of emptying the household vacuum cleaner and analysing its content, which addresses contamination only, rather than examination of the actual airborne concentration, including other relevant airborne materials, is prone to tremendous errors and misjudgments. Due to the many substances potentially present in house dust and indoor air, e.g. bioaerosols originating from animals, pests and microorganisms, volatile organic substances (VOCs) or metals, prudent expert judgment is needed to assess the relevance of analytical findings. The complex indoor exposure scenario makes it especially difficult to causally relate clinical and epidemiological findings to arbitrarily selected indicator substances contained in a matrix not readily available to inhalation exposure.

1858,Cecylia,not vetted,"BAUER, LS",RESISTANCE - A THREAT TO THE INSECTICIDAL CRYSTAL PROTEINS OF BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS,FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST,"Insecticidal crystal proteins (also known as delta-endotoxins) synthesized by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) are the active ingredient of various environmentally friendly insecticides that are 1) highly compatible with natural enemies and other nontarget organisms due to narrow host specificity, 2) harmless to vertebrates, 3) biodegradable in the environment, and 3) highly amenable to genetic engineering. The use of transgenic plants expressing Bt delta-endotoxins has the potential to greatly reduce the environmental and health costs associated with the use of conventional insecticides. The complex mode of action of Bt is the subject of intensive research. When eaten by a susceptible insect delta-endotoxin crystals are solubilized in the midgut; proteases then cleave protoxin molecules into activated toxin which binds to receptors on the midgut brush border membrane. Part of the toxin molecule inserts into the membrane causing the midgut cells to leak, swell, and lyse; death results from bacterial septicemia. Insecticides formulated with Bt account for less than 1% of the total insecticides used each year worldwide because of high cost, narrow host range, and comparatively low efficacy. Environmental contamination, food safety concerns, and pest resistance to conventional insecticides have caused a steady increase in demand for Bt-based insecticides. The recent escalation of commercial interest in Bt has resulted in more persistent and efficacious formulations. For example, improved Bt-based insecticides have allowed management of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). Unfortunately this has resulted in the evolution of resistance to delta-endotoxins in P. xylostella populations worldwide. The recent appearance of Bt resistance in the field, corroborated by the results of laboratory selection experiments, demonstrates genetically-based resistance in several species of Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. The genetic capacity to evolve resistance to these toxins is probably present in all insects, and the heritability, fitness costs, and stability of the resistance trait are documented in several insect populations. In two strains of Bt-resistant lepidopteran species, mechanisms of resistance involve reductions in the binding of toxin to midgut receptors. Research on other resistant strains suggests that other mechanisms are also involved. Unfortunately, the high stability of the resistance trait, as well as broad spectrum cross-resistance to other delta-endotoxins, undermines many potential options for resistance management. Genetically engineered plants, expressing delta-endotoxin continuously and at ultrahigh doses, ensure intense and rapid selection of the target insect population. The efficacy of transgenic plants can be preserved only by developing an integrated pest management program that is designed specifically to reduce selection pressure by minimizing exposure to Bt and increasing other mortality factors, thereby slowing the rate of pest adaptation to Bt.",1995,78,414,443,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3495527

As a hazard indicator for risk assessment, the HQ must be calibrated against measured effects under field conditions. Because protection goals may be context specific, we analyse how choice of acceptance criteria affects setting of the HQ and calibrate HQ for various scenarios under the strict condition that no false negative conclusions may be reached. We use Non-Target Arthropod toxicity data from laboratory studies on inert (Tier 1) and on natural substrates (Tier 2) and calibrate the HQ using application rates and arthropod abundance counts from field studies in orchards, arable fields, and hay meadows in 34 locations in Western Europe. With 21 formulations (17 active substances) tested in mostly multi-rate field studies, our reference data base has 120/121 values at Tier 1/Tier 2, respectively. We use the Proportion of Affected Taxa and Duration of Effect to jointly define acceptance criteria, starting with No Observed Effects. Absence of field effects is correctly predicted with HQ < 1.3 at Tier 1 and HQ < 0.48 at Tier 2, but these settings result in a high proportion of false positive outcomes. Increasing accepted duration of effect from 0 to 4 to 8 weeks results in HQ-threshold changes from 1.3 to 6.4 to 250 for Tier 1 studies and from 0.48 to 1.1 to 5.7 for Tier 2 studies. This coincides with a clear decrease in false positive outcomes. Recovery within a year is correctly concluded for 73% of the products passing the corresponding Tier 1 HQ < 2600 and for 92% of products at Tier 2 (HQ < 230).

To control slugs, chemicals, such as metaldehyde are incorporated into pellets which are toxic to slugs when consumed. Our aim was to compare slug feeding on new pellet types with those already commercially available. Novel pellet types included silica-coated commercial metaldehyde pellets where metaldehyde is released more slowly. An audio sensor was used to record the individual slugs feeding on a variety of pellet types, including toxic (metaldehyde and ferric phosphate) and non-toxic (cereal) pellets. Two types of experiment were conducted: shorter laboratory trials and longer arena trials. The length of each bite and the total number of bites were recorded. There was no difference in the length of the bites between pellet types in laboratory trials. Novel pellets were not consumed more than commercial pellet types. Commercial pellet types did not differ in consumption. Gastropod damage to crop plants has a significant economic impact on agricultural and horticultural industries worldwide, with the Grey Field Slug (Deroceras reticulatum (Muller)) considered the main mollusc pest in the United Kingdom and in many other temperate areas. The prevailing form of crop protection is pellets containing the active ingredient, metaldehyde. Metaldehyde can cause paralysis and death in the mollusc, depending on the amount ingested. The paralysing effects may result in reduced pellet consumption. A greater understanding of metaldehyde consumption may reveal an area that can be manipulated using novel molluscicide formulations. Novel pellet types included commercial metaldehyde pellets coated so that metaldehyde is released more slowly. In both laboratory and arena trials, an audio sensor was used to record individual slugs feeding on a variety of pellet types, including commercially available toxic pellets (metaldehyde and ferric phosphate) and novel metaldehyde formulations.

Nine pens were treated with one application of 3.4 kg active ingredient (ai) per hectare followed by a second 3.4-kg ai/ha application 2 weeks later, nine pens with one 6.7-kg ai/ha application, and nine pens with formulation blank. In addition, the seed fed to the birds in the two chemically treated pens was also treated with chlorpyrifos. Mean residue in the grass samples from the first 3.4-kg treatment pens ranged from 306 +/- 95 ppm on day 0 to 18 +/- 8 ppm on day 14 after treatment. The second 3.4-kg ai/ha treatment grass residues ranged from 361 +/- 167 ppm on day 0 to 38 +/- 24 ppm on day 14 after treatment. Grass residues from the 6.7-kg treatment pens ranged from 903+/-310ppm on day 0 to 9+/-8ppm on day 30 after treatment. Half-lives were similar to2 days and 10 days for grass and seeds, respectively. Whereas the incidence of behavioral deficits was significantly (P = 0.0 156) higher in the 6.7-kg pens (five females, one male), two of the females could have been the same bird because they were both seen in the same pen on days 23 and 24 after treatment. There was no significant difference in mortality, brain acety1cholinesterase activity, or any other measured parameter among any of the treatments. We conclude that application of chlorpyrifos to turf at 3.4 and 6.7kgai/ha is not expected to have chronic deleterious effects on populations of bobwhite quail grazing on treated grass or seeds, provided there is an abundant supply of seeds for the quail to eat.

A formulation containing a 3 : 1 blend of (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal:(Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal at a 0.2% loading rate of active ingredient by weight and deployed twice per season (24 weeks total) at 490 g of formulation/ha caused season-long disruption of male moth catch in pheromone traps as well as reduced leaf infestation. Analysis of pheromone release from dispensers by gas chromatography revealed that effective disruption of P. citrella occurred at a deployment rate of 126 mu g of (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal/ha/h. Direct observation of moth behaviour in the field suggested that disruption by this formulation occurred by a non-competitive mechanism. A formulation of the 3 : 1 attractive blend at a 0.02% pheromone loading rate caused only 2-6 weeks of disruption per deployment and did not reduce leaf infestation during mid and end of the season evaluations. A formulation containing 0.2% of (Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal alone and deployed at 490 g/ha caused 6-7 weeks of moth disruption to pheromone traps and did not prevent leaf infestation, while an identical formulation loaded with 0.02% (w/w) of (Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal alone had no effect on P. citrella orientation to pheromone traps. The SPLAT formulation evaluated herein appears to be an excellent release device for (Z,Z,E)-7,11,13-hexadecatrienal given that approximately 100 days of steady release occurred following an initial brief (ca. 7 days) burst of higher release. The advantages of SPLAT as a formulation for P. citrella disruption include low cost of manufacturing, biodegradable and weather resistant characteristics, and flowability allowing machine application.

Fluridone is an active ingredient in aquatic herbicides used globally to control aquatic plants. In order to be effective, fluridone requires a long contact time with plants resulting in extended exposure to non-target organisms. While there has been limited studies exploring the effects of fluridone on non-target aquatic organisms, the effects of subchronic commercial fluridone exposure at concentrations representative of operational use rates for plant management on fish are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a series of three exposure experiments using environmentally relevant concentrations on different life stages of the fathead minnow (pimephales promelas). We exposed fathead minnows to a commercial fluridone formulation, Spritflo (R), at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.00, 3.00, 12.00, 25.00, and 100.00 mu g/L. Exposure times included subchronic periods up to 35 days and a trans-generation exposure of 65 days, which is a likely residence time of fluridone when applied for plant management. Following 30 days of fluridone exposure, adult male fish had an increased presence of nuptial tubercules, an indicator of endocrine disruption, and an enlarged liver compared to the control. Additionally, we conducted larval fish behavior experiments and found fluridone exposure negatively affected prey capture ability, locomotion, and position preference. Our findings suggest fluridone treatment concentrations used in aquatic plant management do not directly cause mortality in fathead minnows, though sub-lethal effects observed could cause a decline in biological fitness and pose potential ecological implications.",2022,244,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106098

Of major concern is the herbicide molinate that is detected in over 25% of water samples. This pesticide has been the focus of researchers and environmental protection authorities due to continuing frequent detection off-farm despite improved application methods and water management guidelines. The objective of this study was to assess the rice pesticide model RICEWQ version 1.7.2 for its applicability in simulating pesticide in runoff in south-eastern Australia. The model was successfully calibrated against field data on water depths and molinate concentrations from a rice field in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. It was found that the calibrated model was able to simulate the field data in the supply bay adequately; however it is not capable of modeling rice fields with multiple bays, which are much more complex than a single bay situation. Sensitivity analyses of the parameter values on molinate concentrations in ponded water, sediment and foliage were performed. Overall the application efficiency has a major impact and this impact is carried throughout the entire simulation. In ponded water the bulk density, mixing velocity, release rate for slow release formulation, pesticide solubility and water/sediment partition coefficient were relatively sensitive. In the sediment the release rate and the mixing depth, soil bulk density, degradation rate in the sediment, water/sediment partition coefficient and mixing velocity have large sensitivities. On the foliage only three parameters have non-zero sensitivities, the application efficiency, the wash-off coefficient and the degradation rate on foliage. The calibrated model was used to investigate water and pesticide management for a single bay. It was found that water management was critical to minimising molinate runoff. Using a 41 year weather sequence for Griffith in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area it was found that if water levels were maintained 5 cm below the drainage outlet there was little likelihood of surface runoff occurring. Simulation of the registered label application methods and rates for molinate were undertaken. These compared application onto a dry bay, a ponded bay and application by ground rig, aerial, and Soluble Chemical Water Injection In Rice Technique (SCWIIRT) low pressure system. The greatest maximum concentrations of molinate in the ponded water occurred when molinate was applied directly onto the water. The maximum concentrations for application onto a dry bay were two orders of magnitude lower than for the applications onto a bay filled with water. However, the pesticide concentrations in water declined more rapidly for the application onto a water filled bay than for application onto a dry bay. Field trials are required to assess the accuracy of these results as no data comparing ponded water and dry bay applications is available. The comparison of application methods was undertaken by adjusting the application efficiency parameter. This parameter determines how much active ingredient actually meets the target, e. g. enters the water column, with respect to instantaneous losses. This is important for molinate which is highly volatile. This was assigned as 60% (assumed) for the aerial application on dry bay, 70% (assumed) for the ground rig, 95% for aerial application (determined from the model calibration), and 100% (assumed) for the SCWIIRT. The results showed that after three weeks following application the pesticide concentrations in water for all scenarios were similar. Investigating the effect of application rate by increasing the rate by 60%, it was found that the period during which the water molinate concentration was above guideline level only increased by 11%. These modeling results indicate that the application amount is only critical to the concentration of molinate in runoff if it occurs in the first 30 days after application. The results regarding molinate concentrations in water with time and effects of different application rates suggest that poor application efficiency results in a major loss of chemical. If the application efficiency could be improved and application aimed at a target water concentration then lower application rates of molinate could potentially be as effective as current label rates.",2005,NA,2636,2643,NA

Thirty-six Beagles were randomly allocated to six equal groups and individually housed. One group remained nontreated. Another was treated with a placebo formulation (solvents with no active ingredients). Three groups of dogs were treated topically with the metaflumizone plus amitraz formulation (150 mg of each of metaflumizone and amitraz/ml), at volumes providing doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg each active/kg. The final group was treated with a commercial spot-on providing 6.7 mg fipronil/kg. All treatments were applied to the skin at a single spot between the scapulae on Day 0. Dogs were infested with 50 adult brown dog ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) on each of Days -2, 5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 40, and with 100 cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis felis) on Days -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, 34 and 41. Dogs were examined and parasites finger counted on Day I to estimate knock down efficacy, and all animals were comb counted to determine the numbers of viable fleas and ticks on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. There were no significant differences in parasite counts between the nontreated control and the placebo-treated control groups for either fleas or ticks (P > 0.05) except for very slight reductions on Day 7 for fleas and Day 14 for ticks, demonstrating that the formulation excipients had no activity. The qualitative finger counts on Day I indicated that all of the insecticidal treatments resulted in a noticeable reduction in flea and tick numbers within I day of treatment. All of the metaflumizone and amitraz treatments and fipronil resulted in significantly lower flea and tick numbers relative to nontreated controls on all posttreatment count days (P < 0.05). For the metaflumizone plus amitraz treatments, mean flea and tick counts for the 10 mg/kg dose were significantly higher than those for the 20 mg/kg dose (P < 0.05) from Day 21 on. There was no significant advantage provided by the 40 mg/kg dose over the 20 mg dose throughout the entire study (P > 0.05).

The roles of glyphosate in embryo-toxicity and neurotoxicity have been reported in human and animal models. Recently, several studies have reported evidence linking neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) with gestational glyphosate exposure. However, the role of glyphosate in neuronal development is still not fully understood. Our previous study found that perinatal glyphosate exposure resulted in differential microRNA expression in the prefrontal cortex of mouse offspring. However, the mechanism of glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain is still not fully understood. Considering the pivotal role of Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the regulation of gene expression, a circRNA microarray method was used in this study to investigate circRNA expression changes in the hippocampus of mice with perinatal glyphosate exposure. The circRNA microarrays revealed that 663 circRNAs were significantly altered in the perinatal glyphosate exposure group compared with the control group. Among them, 330 were significantly upregulated, and the other 333 were downregulated. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of mmu-circRNA-014015, mmu-circRNA-28128 and mmu-circRNA-29837 were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses demonstrated that stress-associated steroid metabolism pathways, such as aldosterone synthesis and secretion pathways, may be involved in the neurotoxicity of glyphosate. These results showed that circRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the hippocampus of mice with perinatal glyphosate exposure and play potential roles in glyphosate-induced neurotoxicity.

Onion vegetative growth and bulb yield in fumigated plots was significantly increased over non-fumigated plots. In controlled environment trials using an onion seedling bioassay, several fungicides were evaluated as a soil surface spray application. Products containing the active ingredients difenconazole, iprodione, flutolanil and two experimental fungicide formulations increased onion seedling growth under at least one of the rates evaluated. Treatments evaluating boscalid with pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin with fludioxonil, iprodione, flutolanil and the two experimental compounds reduced pathogen soil infestation. Fungicides azoxystrobin (Amistar(R)) and pentachloronitrobenzene (Terraclor(R)) applied as a drench to stunted plants on a commercial property 13 weeks after sowing did not increase bulb weight at harvest and a higher rate of azoxystrobin inhibited bulb development. While strobilurins effectively inhibited Rhizoctonia soil activity, they were phytotoxic and the method of application and rate needs to be adjusted to minimise phytotoxicity to onion seedlings.",2012,969,255,260,NA

The authors examined the effectiveness of ten pyrethroid insecticide aerosol formulations registered for the household control of flies. Tests were performed using adult Musca domestica L. Knockdown effects and mortality were measured in a test chamber using the manufacturer's recommended discharge time. RESULTS: The knockdown effect varied greatly between aerosols of similar composition. The knockdown 15 min post-treatment was 66 - 98% for flies placed 120 cm above floor level and 53 - 96% for flies placed at a height of 180 cm. The KDT50 values ranged from 2.5 to 9.2 min for flies placed at 120 cm and from 3.2 to 12 min for flies placed at 180 cm.

Its overuse has caused much damage to the environment, livestock breeding, agricultural crops and humans. However, little is known about the effects of FE exposure on female reproductive health and the mechanisms underlying those effects. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of FE on oocyte quality and their underlying mechanisms in mice fed a diet containing FE. RESULTS Ovary weight and numbers of oocytes were reduced in FE-treated mice. Moreover, oocyte quality was seriously impaired, as shown by the reduced rate of first polar body extrusion and fertilization ability in vivo. In FE-treated mice, oocytes presented reduced actin expression and abnormal meiotic spindle morphology, which indicate that cytoskeletal integrality is disrupted. Also, FE induced mitochondrial dysfunction, reflected by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis and autophagy, as revealed by fluorescent staining analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Finally, FE led to changes in epigenetic modifications such as histone H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 in oocytes. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that FE has adverse effects on oocyte quality as assessed by maturation and fertilization potential, due to disrupted cytoskeletal integrality, and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to ROS accumulation, apoptosis and autophagy.

Surprisingly, Roundup is always more toxic than its active ingredient. We tested the effects of glyphosate and Roundup at lower nontoxic concentrations on aromatase, the enzyme responsible for estrogen synthesis. The glyphosate-based herbicide disrupts aromatase activity and mRNA levels and interacts with the active site of the purified enzyme, but the effects of glyphosate are facilitated by the Roundup formulation in microsomes or in cell culture.

Because BCME is an extremely potent lung carcinogen, the nature and went of prolonged exposures that recur in homes during the mosquito season in tropical regions must be evaluated with respect to health. In a small analytical study, cods purchased in Indonesia and in the United States contained highly variable amounts of S-2. Some coils that contained S-2 were not labeled, making it impossible for consumers to make an informed decision about coil contents.

A key objective of industry is to deliver active ingredients (AIs) that have minimal off site migration and non-target activity. Nanoporous materials have received significant attention internationally for the efficient loading and controlled, targeted delivery of pesticides. This is largely made possible due to their textural features including high surface area, large pore-volume, and tunable pore size. Additionally, the easier manipulation of their surface chemistry and stability in different environments are added advantages. The unique features of these materials allow them to address the solubility of the active ingredients, their efficient loading onto the porous channels, and slow and controlled delivery over time. One of their major advantages is the wide range of materials that could be suitably designed via different approaches to either adsorb, encapsulate, or entrap the active ingredient. This review is a timely presentation of recent progress made in nanoporous materials and discusses critical aspects of pesticide formulation and delivery.",2022,343,187,206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.01.036

IPBC is used in Canada in antisapstain formulations for treatment of freshly sawn lumber, as an industrial mildewcide, and as an antimicrobial. In British Columbia, IPBC is an active ingredient in the most widely used antisapstain formulation (Kop-Coat NP-1); 36,020 kg of IPBC were used by lumber mills for antisapstain purposes in 1996. IPBC is moderately soluble in water, and is not likely to adsorb to suspended solids or sediments. It is not persistent in the water column; hydrolysis is expected to be the main route of dissipation. IPBC was reported to affect fathead minnows at levels as low as 0.019 mg L-1 and Daphnia magna at levels as low as 0.07 mg L-1. It is not expected to bioaccumulate. An interim water quality guideline for the protection of freshwater aquatic life of 1.9 mu g L-1 is recommended.

This study describes the design and testing of a sensor that attempted to monitor concentration of chemicals upstream from each nozzle body. The sensor is based on an LED and photodiode pair. Its ability to detect chemical concentration within the main carrier was tested with a 2,4-D formulation, a glyphosate formulation, and a powdered Acid Blue 9 dye. The liquid herbicide formulations of glyphosate and 2,4-D were tested across common application concentrations of 0% to 12.5% by volume. The powdered dye produced a much stronger effect on the sensor and was only tested at the much lower concentrations of 0 to 50 mg L-1. Further tests were conducted in which the dye was mixed with the herbicide formulation before the combined solution was added to the carrier. While this enabled establishment of pre-determined sensor outputs based on given concentrations of the pre-mixed solution, the sensor may have been responding to the predominance of a dye mixed with a herbicide formulation and not directly to the concentration of the herbicide. While the sensor did not appreciably respond to the concentration of the glyphosate formulation, it did respond in a consistent manner to the 2,4-D formulation and the dye. The sensor's response to the concentration of these chemicals was a rational (1/x type) relationship, and the R-2 values for the rational models describing these relationships were greater than 0.99. With the mixed dye and herbicide formulation, the effects of the dye and the 2,4-D formulation combined independently, and the total sensor output was a multiplication of the percent effect of each alone. The test with the pre-mixed dye and 2,4-D formulation produced the expected 1 V output at a 12.5% by volume concentration of the 2,4-D formulation, proving that dye can be added to a herbicide to produce a desired response from the sensor. Overall, the sensor's response was remarkably stable, with a maximum standard deviation of 42.2 mg L-1 of 2,4-D active ingredient for samples taken at a constant chemical concentration. These tests confirmed that the sensor could respond to chemical formulations and dye in a consistent and predictable manner. However, use of the sensor for herbicide monitoring will require sensor calibration for each combination of herbicide and dye mixture, as the light transmittance properties of the tested mixtures were not quantified and the light transmittance properties of formulations and dyes can be arbitrarily changed by manufacturers.",2016,59,1089,1099,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/trans.59.11473

This system permits the study of penetration of an active ingredient under steady-state conditions from a donor solution through an interfacing CM into a receiver solution. NAA penetration was related to TX- 100 concentration where increasing concentration up to 0.1% increased NAA flux and permeance, but concentrations > 0.1% decreased both flux and permeance. Sorption of NAA by the CM was independent of TX-100 concentration up to 0.0475%, but decreased with higher concentrations. The decrease in the NAA permeance coefficient at higher surfactant concentrations (> 0.1%) was less than the decrease in the partition coefficient.

Glyphosate, its active ingredient in plants and its main metabolite (AMPA) are among the first contaminants of surface waters. Roundup is being used increasingly in particular on genetically modified plants grown for food and feed that contain its residues. Here we tested glyphosate and its formulation on mature rat fresh testicular cells from 1 to 10000 ppm, thus from the range in some human urine and in environment to agricultural levels. We show that from 1 to 48 h of Roundup exposure Leydig cells are damaged. Within 24-48 h this formulation is also toxic on the other cells, mainly by necrosis, by contrast to glyphosate alone which is essentially toxic on Sertoli cells. Later, it also induces apoptosis at higher doses in germ cells and in Sertoli/germ cells co-cultures. At lower non toxic concentrations of Roundup and glyphosate (1 ppm), the main endocrine disruption is a testosterone decrease by 35%. The pesticide has thus an endocrine impact at very low environmental doses, but only a high contamination appears to provoke an acute rat testicular toxicity. This does not anticipate the chronic toxicity which is insufficiently tested, and only with glyphosate in regulatory tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Results were compared to its ionic analogue (i.e., CuSO4) and nano-Cu(OH)(2) including both the commercial unformulated active ingredient of NPF (AI-NPF) and synthesized Cu(OH)(2) nanorods (NR). There were negligible changes in the activity of acid phosphatase, regardless of exposure dose, whereas significant (p < 0.05) variations in activities of invertase, urease, and catalase were observed at a dose of 5 mg kg(-1) or higher.

Accordingly, NPF, AI-NPF, and NR differently affected soil bacterial abundance, diversity, and community compared to CuSO4, which could have resulted from the changes in the bioavailable Cu concentration as a result of the distinct nature of copper spiked (i.e., nano form versus salt). Moreover, minor differences in the soil enzyme activity and bacterial community were observed between NPF and AI-NPF, reflecting that the impact of the Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide was primarily attributed to the presence of nano-Cu(OH)(2).

The effect of procyanidolic oligomers on photo degradation of chlorothalonil was investigated under sunlight and artificial lights. Procyanidolic oligomers enhanced photodegradation of chlorothalonil in paddy, reservoir, pond and distilled waters for 1.8, 4.6, 2.7 and 22.8 fold, respectively, relative to the procyanidolic oligomers free control. The mechanism was evidenced as a radical reduction reaction by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Upon exposure to high-pressure mercury light, chlorothalonil produced 2,4,5-trichloro-1,3-dicyanobenzene, 2,5-dichloro-1,3-dicyanobenzene and 5-chloro-1,3-dicyanobenzene that were isolated, identified and characterized. Chlorothalonil underwent primarily step-wide photo reductive dechlorination in the presence of procyanidolic oligomers, which avoided the production of the highly toxic 4-hydroxy chlorothalonil. Procyanidolic oligomers possessed strong reductive property to photo reductive dechlorination. The results contributed to understanding of chlorothalonil phototransformation and high potential of using natural product procyanidolic oligomers as an additive to minimize aquatic toxicity and pollution of chlorothalonil.

The active ingredients of this formulation comprise essential oil components and limonene hydroperoxides. The formulation prevented the development of decay in P. digitatum-inoculated fruits, and markedly reduced decay in non-inoculated citrus fruits. Similar good control was shown for other fruits and against several other fungi and bacteria. These natural compounds were found to be active against human pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and others. A major advantage of this new formulation is its non-toxic food grade character and high chances of approval for use on fresh agricultural produce by the health authorities. The new formulation has both a direct fungicidal activity and also elicits the fruit to build its endogenous defense mechanisms against decay. These combined modes of activity greatly improve the potential to control decay. Several other uses in household hygiene and in reducing contamination with this fragrant environmentally friendly food grade new product are possible.

1915,Cecylia,not vetted,"Haylamicheal, ID; Dalvie, MA","Disposal of obsolete pesticides, the case of Ethiopia",ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,"Ethiopia has accumulated obsolete pesticide stocks since pesticides were first imported in the 1960s due to prolonged storage of pesticides, inappropriate storage conditions because of poor storage facilities, the lack of trained staff and lack of national legislation for pesticide registration and monitoring system of pesticide use in the country. The first pesticide inventory conducted in 1995 led by FAO in collaboration with the government of Ethiopia had identified about 426 tonnes of obsolete pesticides mainly on state-owned agricultural farms and held by the Ministry of Health. However, these stocks have increased to over 1500 tonnes (including 200 active ingredients) as found in a detailed inventory conducted in 1999. The stocks included organochlorines (258.3 tonnes), organophosphates (155.4 tonnes), carbamates (58.5 tonnes), coumarines (14.9 tonnes), inorganics (30.2 tonnes), others (257.2 tonnes), mixed pesticides (70.4 tonnes) and unknown pesticides (307.1 tonnes) including both liquid and solid state formulations. The obsolete organochlorine pesticides stocks were mostly pesticides such as chlordane, DDT, dieldrin and lindane that are banned or restricted in most countries. The highest amount of a single active ingredient found was the organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos methyl (172.1 tonnes). All these stocks were disposed of in the first phase of disposal in Finland (during 2000-2003) by the hazardous waste management company Ekokem at a cost of about US$ 4.44 million. Another 1000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides have been identified and are currently being eliminated in a second disposal phase at a total cost of US$ 8 135500. Along with the disposal process, a number of activities are being implemented to prevent future pesticides accumulation. These activities include the development and enforcement of pesticide policy, the implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Integrated Vector Management (IVM), capacity building in terms of providing professional trainings, creating awareness among stakeholders on the environmental and human health hazard posed by obsolete pesticides as well as other actions to prevent their accumulation and enforcement of national legislations and policies related to pesticides use. However, pesticide use in the country is increasing. For instance, 12 years of pesticides import data (1996-2007) by the Ministry of Agriculture shows that 2973 tonnes of pesticides were imported between 1996-1998, 3670 tonnes between 1999-2001, 5079 tonnes between 2002-2004 and 8302 tonnes between 2005-2007. Moreover, 6 years of insecticide import data (1996/97-2001/02) by the Ministry of Health shows that around 919 tonnes of insecticides were imported between 1996/97-1997/98, 812 tonnes between 1998/99-1999/00 and 970 tonnes between 20001 01-2001/02 for malaria and other vector borne diseases control.

G. 2013. Resistance to cyprodinil and lack of fludioxonil resistance in Botrytis cinerea isolates from strawberry in North and South Carolina. Plant Dis. 97:81-85. Chemical control of gray mold of strawberry caused by Botrytis cinerea is essential to prevent pre- and postharvest fruit decay. For more than 10 years. the anilinopyrimidine (AP) cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil (Switch 62.5WG) have been available to commercial strawberry producers in the United States for gray mold control. Both active ingredients are site-specific inhibitors and, thus, prone to resistance development. In this study, 217 single-spore isolates of B. cinerea from 11 commercial strawberry fields in North and South Carolina were examined for sensitivity to both fungicides. Isolates that were sensitive (53%), moderately resistant (30%), or resistant (17%) to cyprodinil were identified based on germ tube inhibition at discriminatory doses of cyprodinil at 1 and 25 mg/liter at 10 of the 11 locations. None of the isolates was fludioxonil resistant. Phenotypes that were moderately resistant or resistant to cyprodinil were not associated with fitness penalties for mycelial growth rate, spore production, or osmotic sensitivity. Detached fruit assays demonstrated cross resistance between the two AP fungicides cyprodinil and pyrimethanil, and that isolates that were characterized in vitro as moderately resistant or resistant were equivalent in pathogenicity on fruit sprayed with pyrimethanil (currently the only AP registered in strawberry as a solo formulation). This suggests that the in vitro distinction of moderately resistant and resistant isolates is of little if any field relevance. The absence of cross-resistance with fludioxonil, iprodione, cycloheximide, and tolnaftate indicated that multidrug resistance in the form of multidrug resistance phenotypes was unlikely to be involved in conferring resistance to APs in our isolates.

Herein, we developed nanocarrier-based formulations, namely micro- and nanoemulsions (ME and NE, respectively) containing C. acaulis EO or carlina oxide (both at 0.5%) as active ingredients (a.i.). The larvicidal activity of ME and NE was evaluated against Culex quinquefasciatus.

The incorporation of polymeric adjuvants improves the efficacy of the spray solutions, thus enabling crop growers to maximise the performance of agrochemical sprays at lower dose rates of active ingredient. It is important to establish a fundamental understanding of how polymers influence the processes involved in droplet deposition. RESULTS: The shear and extensional viscosities of a series of high molecular mass (M-w) poly(acrylamides) (M-w similar to 10(6) - 10(7)) have been determined at very low concentrations (100 - 1000 mg L-1). The polymer solutions demonstrated typical shear thinning characteristics under shear, and strain hardening behaviour under extension above a critical strain rate. The presence of the polymers was shown to increase the size of droplets produced in atomisation using an agricultural spray nozzle, as measured by laser diffraction. This was attributed to the increase in the extensional viscosity at the strain rates generated under pressure in the spray nozzle and was a function of both polymer concentration and Mw. In addition, the presence of polymer was found to have a significant influence on droplet bounce. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of very low concentrations of high molecular mass poly (acrylamides) significantly influences the size of droplets formed on atomisation and subsequent bounce characteristics. Large extensional viscosities generated above a critical strain rate are responsible for both processes. (c) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.",2008,64,497,504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.1523

The focus of ongoing research was on the development of a nanoencapsulated pesticide formulation that has slow releasing properties with enhanced solubility, permeability, and stability. These properties are mainly achieved through either protecting the encapsulated active ingredients from premature degradation or increasing their pest control efficacy for a longer period. Nanoencapsulated pesticide formulation is able to reduce the dosage of pesticides and human exposure to them, which is environmentally friendly for crop protection. However, lack of knowledge of the mechanism of synthesis and lack of a cost benefit analysis of nanoencapsulation materials hindered their application in pesticide delivery.

To further understand the impact of these compounds on bird species and to improve risk assessment capacities, the current study determined the acute toxicities of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam formulations on South American eared doves (Zenaida auriculata). Insecticides were administered by gavage to adult doves to determine median lethal doses (LD50) according to a standardized sequential procedure. The acute toxicity of formulated imidacloprid (LD50 = 59 mg active ingredient, a.i./kg body weight, b.w.) was much higher than that of the tested formulations of clothianidin (LD50 = 4248 mg a.i./kg b.w.) and thiamethoxam (LD50 = 4366 mg a.i./kg b.w.). Imidacloprid also differed from the other two neonicotinoids in terms of the onset and intensity of intoxication signs and the times of death and recovery. All three insecticides induced a reduction in food consumption that led to body weight loss. An average weight dove of 127 g would obtain a dose equivalent to the LD50 of imidacloprid by consuming 1.7 g of treated sorghum seeds. As eared doves offered non-treated sorghum seeds 5 h per day consumed on average 6.4 +/- 1.8 g (mean +/- S.D.), it is concluded that these doves could feasibly be exposed to lethal doses in the field.

The biomixture used for this strategy should be able to remove different active ingredients but its efficiency can vary due to the constant load of pesticides from crop application programs. For that reason, the performance of biomixtures in conditions that mimic the real pesticide treatment before their implementation in field settings should be assayed. This study aimed to evaluate the removal and detoxifying capacity of a previously formulated biomixture (coconut fiber, 50% v/v; compost, 25%; and soil pre-exposed to pesticides, 25%) during a simulated cycle of pesticide application (93 days) for potato production. The scheme included a first application of linuron followed by a weekly alternated treatment of the mixtures chlorpyrifos/metalaxyl and malathion/dimethomorph, and antibiotics at day 72. The biomixture showed efficient removal of linuron (half-life < 15 days), and a fluctuating transformation rate for the other compounds. A constant and sustained removal was observed for malathion and methalaxyl. In contrast, lower efficiency and accumulation was described for chlorpyrifos and dimethomorph. Following antibiotic treatment, changes on pesticide removal were observed only in the case of chlorpyrifos, whose removal was slightly enhanced. Furthermore, acute toxicity assays showed limited detoxification of the matrix, especially when compounds began to accumulate. Summarizing, our experiments showed that the proposed biomixture does not support a proper removal of the pesticides during the simulated application cycle of potato production.

For mesotrione and terbuthylazine, synergistic effects for control of broad-leaved and grass weeds are shown in field results from the 2000 and 2001 season. Calculation according to the model Of COLBY (1967), applied to greenhouse results at sublethal doses demonstrates that a true synergism of two active ingredients, each performing by a different mode of action, is involved. As enhanced uptake and reduced metabolism can be excluded, an explanation for this synergism is discussed based on the different mode of action of the ingredients. Mesotrione after post-emergent application offers predominantly foliar activity, terbuthylazine acts via leaf and soil. The residual activity of such a mixture is mainly due to terbuthylazine, which is active mostly on broad-leaved species. To provide residual activity through the required critical period for yield in maize, and to include control of late emerging grass weeds, the residual partner S-metolachlor can be added. The reliable duration of activity of a combination of terbuthylazine and S-metolachlor is shown under greenhouse conditions.

The FTIR peaks showed the successful interaction between O-H stretching bonds in starch with COO- in alginate Furthermore, the peak at 3430cm(-1) verified that crosslinking action was successfully employed. At the same time, the phosphate group was successfully retained in its own form. The amount of phosphorous released into distilled water was measured using HPLC with a mobile phase of water to methanol ratio of 80:20 v/v% under the wavelength of 240nm for phosphate compound detection. The swelling and dissolution study of hydrogel was carried out using the weighing technique. Microscopy images at magnification of 40X verified that calcium chloride was able to improve the surface morphology of the hydrogel.

We investigated how three BREAK-THRU (R) additives (BT301: biodegradable, BT133 and BT420: bio-based and biodegradable) tank-mixed with commercial copper preparations influenced the spray distribution, leaf uptake and biological efficacy of copper additive mixtures against apple scab and apple powdery mildew under controlled conditions. We quantified the synergetic effects of these additives in foliar applications. In addition, we determined the phytotoxic potential and evaluated their impacts on photosynthetic activity, non-photochemical quenching and ROS activity. The additives BT301 and BT420 strongly reduced surface tension and contact angle of copper treatments. The fluorescence observations revealed that BT301 achieved better spreading of copper formulation with more complete coverage of the leaf surface than BT420 and BT133, whereas 'coffee-ring' spreading was observed with BT133. The additive BT301 showed an increase in relative fluorescence area, indicating higher ROS production as a signal of intra-cellular tissue activity. The photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) was not negatively influenced by copper or additive treatment. Thus, we observed no phytotoxic effects of copper-additive mixtures on apple leaves at treatment doses of 4 g Cu2+ L-1. All copper treatments reduced apple scab infections significantly, by 53%-76%. Interestingly, addition of BT301 to copper preparations showed the strongest biological efficacy (83% reduction) against Venturia inaequalis, whereas addition of BT420 showed the strongest effect against Podosphaera leucotricha (89% infection reduction).

The few literature sources that investigate the environmental fate and toxicity to non-target organisms of encapsulated commercially available pesticide products with regard to capsule size report on average sizes between 20 and 50 mu m. Here, we have identified a CS formulation with an average capsule size of approximately 2 mu m with some capsules extending into the nanometer scale (similar to 200 nm). Determining how carrier size influences toxicity is important to understanding if current pesticide risk assessments are sufficient to protect against products that incorporate encapsulation technology. Here, a commercial pyrethroid CS pesticide with lambda-cyhalothrin (lambda-Cy) as the a.i. was separated into two suspensions, a fraction consisting of nano-sized capsules (similar to 250 nm) and a fraction of micron-sized capsules (similar to 2200 nm) in order to investigate the influence of capsule size on toxicity to embryonic zebrafish, Danio rerio. Toxicity was evaluated 24 h after exposure to equivalent amounts of a.i. by the presence and severity of pyrethroid-specific tremors, 14 sublethal developmental impacts and mortality. Fish exposed to greater than 20 mu g a.i. L-1 technical lambda-Cy or formulated product experienced curvature of the body axis, pericardial edema, craniofacial malformations, and mortality. Exposure to the unfractionated formulation, micro fraction, nano fraction and technical a.i. resulted in no significant differences in the occurrence of sublethal impacts or mortality; however, the technical a.i. exposure resulted in significantly less fish experiencing tremors and shorter tremors compared to any of the formulated product exposures. This suggests that the capsule size does not influence the toxic response of the entrapped lambda-Cy, but the presence or absence of the capsules does. Testing across other encapsulated products is needed to determine if size does not have influence on toxicity regardless of encapsulation technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we sought to develop a more sustainable control tool by using the mealybug's sex pheromone to reduce mating and thereby lower pest damage. The mature female mealybug emits a sex pheromone that the winged adult male uses to find and mate with females. Synthetically produced sex pheromone, specific to the vine mealybug, was enclosed in commercial dispensers and deployed in vineyards in 2004-2007 studies to determine if mating disruption could provide a viable control option. Trials were conducted in commercial vineyards with cooperating farmers. Across all trials, mating disruption reduced pheromone trap captures of adult male mealybugs-an indication that the population numbers were lowered-and there was often a reduction mealybug numbers on vines and/or crop damage. There was not a clear reduction in the proportion of female mealybugs with ovisacs (a cottony-like mass containing mealybug eggs), but this may have resulted from the production of non-viable ovisacs that were not differentiated in the field samples. Pheromone trap captures were never lowered to zero (often called trap shut down), possibly because trials were conducted in vineyards with unusually high mealybug densities. Trap capture patterns commonly began low in April-May, increased in mid-July or August, and often decreased in September-October when post-harvest insecticides were applied. Results over all years suggest season-long coverage or late season coverage may be as or more important than dose per hectare. This research was used to help initiate the commercialization of mating disruption products for the vine mealybug, which are now being successfully used throughout the world's grape-growing regions where this pest is found. The vine mealybug (VMB),Planococcus ficus(Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), is a key insect pest of vineyards, and improvements in sustainable control of this pest are needed to meet increasing consumer demand for organically farmed products. One promising option is mating disruption. In a series of experiments conducted from 2004 to 2007, we tested the effects of mating disruption on trap captures ofPl. ficusmales in pheromone-baited traps, onPl. ficusnumbers and age structure on vines, and on damage to grape clusters. From 2004 to 2005, the effects of dispenser load (mg active ingredient per dispenser) were also assessed, and dispensers were compared to a flowable formulation. Across all trials, mating disruption consistently reduced pheromone trap captures and often reduced mealybug numbers on vines and/or crop damage, regardless of the pheromone dose that was applied. Reductions inPl. ficusdensities in mating disruption plots were not accompanied by clear effects on mealybug population age structure; however, production of non-viable ovisacs by unmated females may have obscured differences in proportional representation of ovisacs. Pheromone trap captures were never lowered to zero (often called trap shut down), possibly because trials were conducted in vineyards with unusually highPl. ficusdensities. Trap-capture patterns in both treated and control plots commonly began low in April-May, increased in mid-July or August, and often decreased in September-October when post-harvest insecticides were applied. During the four-year trial, the release rate from plastic sachet dispensers was improved by industry cooperators as pheromone was released too quickly (2004) or not completely released during the season (2005-2006). The flowable formulation performed slightly better than dispensers at the same application dose. Results over all years suggest season-long coverage or late-season coverage may be as or more important than dose per hectare. Development of a dispenser with optimized season-long pheromone emission or targeted seasonal periods should be a future goal.",2020,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects11090635

Adverse effects of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians have been already discussed in several studies with different conclusions, especially regarding sublethal effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. Therefore, we studied the acute toxic effects (mortality, growth, and morphological changes) of the commonly used glyphosate-based herbicide formulation RoundupA (R) UltraMax on early aquatic developmental stages of two anuran species with different larval types (obligate vs. facultative filtrating suspension feeders), the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) and the Mediterranean painted frog (Discoglossus pictus). While X. laevis is an established anuran model organism in amphibian toxicological studies, we aim to establish D. pictus as another model for species with facultative filtrating larvae. A special focus of the present study lies on malformations in X. laevis embryos, which were investigated using histological preparations. In general, embryos and larvae of X. laevis reacted more sensitive concerning lethal effects compared to early developmental stages of D. pictus. It was suggested, that especially the different morphology of their filter apparatus and the higher volume of water pumped through the buccopharynx of X. laevis larvae lead to higher exposure to the formulation. The test substance induced similar lethal effects in D. pictus larvae as it does in the teleost standard test organism used in pesticide approval, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), whereas embryos of both species are apparently more tolerant and, conversely, X. laevis larvae about two times more sensitive. In both species, early larvae always reacted significantly more sensitive than embryos. Exposure to the test substance increased malformation rates in embryos of both species in a concentration-dependent manner, but not at environmentally relevant concentrations. However, the assumed field safety, based on calculated surface water concentrations of the active ingredient (glyphosate), should be validated with realistic field data and buffer strips have to be urgently regarded to any aquatic amphibian habitat.",2017,24,1495,1508,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7927-z

Glyphosate is a chelating agent that can form stable complexes with divalent metal ions including Cu(II). Little is known about the bioavailability and ecotoxicity of glyphosate-Cu(II) complexes to aquatic organisms. In this study, we used video tracking and behavior analysis to investigate sublethal effects of binary mixtures of glyphosate and Cu(II) to juvenile D. magna. Behavioral responses were quantified for individual D. magna after 24 h and 48 h exposure to glyphosate and glyhosate-Cu(II) mixtures. Sublethal concentrations resulted in decreases in swimming velocity, acceleration speed, and distance moved whereas inactive time of D. magna increased. Distance moved and inactive time were the most responsive parameters to glyphosate and glyphosate-Cu(II) exposure. On a molar basis, glyphosate-Cu(II) complexes appeared more toxic to D. magna than glyphosate alone. The 48 h EC50 for glyphosate and glyphosate-Cu(II) determined from swimming distance were 75.2 mu M and 8.4 mu M, respectively. In comparison, traditional visual observation of mobility resulted in 48 h EC50 values of 52.8 mu M and 25.5 mu M for glyphosate and glyphosate-Cu(II), respectively. The behavioral responses indicated that exposure of D. magna to mixtures of glyphosate and Cu(II) attenuated acute metal toxicity but increased apparent glyphosate toxicity due to complexation with Cu(II). The study suggests that glyphosate is a likely mediator of aquatic metal toxicity, and that video tracking provides an opportunity for quantitative studies of sublethal effects of pesticide complexes.

Efficacy of seed treatments for controlling late blight was examined under three disease development regimes simulated by artifical inoculation; (a) seed-borne infection, (b) transmission of infection resulting from spread during the seed-cutting operation, and (c) infection of foliage by aerial inoculation. Emergence of plants from the seed-borne infection was uniformly low (<40%) in controlled environment and field experiments. In controlled environment experiments some of the plants that emerged from fungicide-treated seed-pieces were infected with late blight. Following exposure of tuber surfaces to P infestans, emergence rates from seed-pieces treated with formulated products that included mancozeb in the formulation were comparable to the untreated and non-inoculated control in controlled environment and field experiments. Plants that emerged from non-inoculated seed-pieces treated with fungicides that contained active ingredients known to be effective against foliar late blight had lower percentage foliar infection after inoculation than the untreated control. Leaves close to the base of the stem had fewer infections than leaves attached at the mid region of the main stem, 14 days after inoculation, in some of the controlled environment studies.

Kleaf-air values were measured using a solid-phase fugacity meter. A portion of the leaves were also used for foliar penetration experiments.

No correlations between Kleaf-air values and relative humidity were observed. Foliar penetration increased with temperature for chlorpyrifos both as an active ingredient and in the formulation. Increasing foliar penetration with temperature is attributed to increasing diffusion into inner leaf layers.

The actual measurement results agree well with the forecasting results. When compared with the solubility in pure water, some PAIs can even be mutually dissolvable with tetraethylammonium chloride: decanoic acid (1:2), tetrabutylammonium chloride: decanoic acid (1:3), and tetrabutylammonium chloride: phenol (1:5), such as butachlor, acetochlor, and metolachlor.

The acute toxicity of Roundup (particularly of glyphosate) to animals is considered to be low according to the World Health Organization, but the extensive use of Roundup may still cause environmental problems with negative impact on wildlife, particularly in an aquatic environment where chemicals may persist for a long time. Therefore, we studied the effects of Roundup on markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense in goldfish, Carassius auratus. The fish were given 96 h exposure to Roundup at concentrations of 2.5-20 mg L-1. Exposure to Roundup did not affect levels of lipid peroxides (LOOH) in goldfish brain or liver, and in kidney only the 10 mg L-1 treatment elevated LOOH by 3.2-fold. Herbicide exposure also had no effect on the concentrations of protein thiols or low molecular mass thiols in kidney, but selective suppression of low molecular mass thiols by 26-29% occurred at some treatment levels in brain and liver. Roundup exposure generally suppressed the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in fish tissues. For example, SOD activities were reduced by 51-68% in brain, 58-67% in liver and 33-53% in kidney of Roundup treated fish. GST activity decreased by 29-34% in liver. However, catalase activity increased in both liver and kidney of herbicide-exposed fish. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a systematic response by the antioxidant systems of fish to Roundup exposure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

They produce essential oils (EOs) inside oil canals, known as ducts and vittae, which occur in their vegetative and reproductive organs. Given the high EO yields and the availability of raw material from cultivations widespread all over the world, Apiaceae are exploitable for different industrial applications. An interesting perspective is their utilization in the fabrication of botanical insecticides effective against insect vectors of public importance such as mosquitoes, aiming to be ecofriendly alternatives to synthetic insecticides. On this basis, in the current review, we collected scientific evidence supporting the use of Apiaceae EOs and their major constituents as active ingredients in insecticidal formulations against larvae and adults of several mosquitoes that are important pathogen vectors (e.g., Anopheles, Aedes and Culex species). For this purpose, we analysed the published data on their larvicidal, ovicidal, oviposition deterrent, pupicidal, adulticidal, and repellent effects, using efficacy thresholds as in the case of larvicidal activity (LC50 (lethal concentration killing 50 % of the exposed population) < 50 ppm). Toxicity to non-target organisms, including vertebrates, has also been reviewed. The major EO constituents have been highlighted, each with its spectrum of mosquitocidal activity, providing insights on their multiple modes of action. The urgent need to develop highly stable micro/nano-formulations for real-world use has been outlined. Current weaknesses and strengths in the steps toward the development of botanical insecticides have been analysed to increase awareness of the future challenges necessary to open the doors to the industrial utilization of Apiaceae EOs by agrochemical companies.",2021,171,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113892

Nanoemulsions (NEs) can enhance the bioactivity of the EO to prevent the premature volatility and degradation of the active ingredients. In our work, geranium EO (Geranium maculatum L.) was used to develop micro and nanoemulsions adding Tween 80 as surfactant. For NEs formulation, ultrasound was applied and the physicochemical and ultrasound parameters were optimized: oil: surfactant ratio = 1:2, ultrasound power = 65 W, sonication time = 2 min, cycles = 30 on/20 off and ultrasonic probe distance = 3.7 cm. The NEs obtained had 13.58 nm and polydisperse index (PDI) values of 0.069. They were stored at 25 degrees C and were stable for 60 days.

The C-14-herbicides were applied to leaves as c. 0.2-mu-l droplets, usually containing 0.5 g l-1 active ingredient, plus adjuvants in the range 0.05-5 g l.1. The addition of non-ionic polyoxyethylene surfactants to solutions of both herbicides could induce considerable foliar uptake. Aliphatic C-13/C-15 alcohol surfactants generally improved uptake more than nonylphenol surfactants when used at equivalent concentrations and ethylene oxide (EO) contents. The surfactant threshold for enhancement of difenzoquat uptake in wild oat was very low (0.05 g l-1), whilst that in field bean was much higher (>0.5 g l-1). For 2,4-D, surfactants at >0.5 g l-1 were needed to produce substantial increases in its uptake into both species. Although surfactants of low EO content (5-6) were less efficient at promoting difenzoquat uptake than those of higher EO content (10-20), particularly in wild oat, there was little dependence on surfactant EO content for enhancement of 2,4-D uptake. Adjuvants with humectant properties also promoted penetration of difenzoquat, but less so than alcohol or nonylphenol surfactants.

The application process can be viewed as a series of complex interdependent events, including: formulation of the active ingredient; atomization of the spray liquid; transport of the spray cloud to the tree; spray droplet impaction; retention; and residue formation and penetration of the nutrient. Any significant change in one event has profound effects on others, and each may be affected by application parameters, plant factors and environmental conditions. Only limited data have been generated specifically on effects of application parameters on performance of nutrient sprays. Thus, we have drawn heavily on studies of application of aqueous solutions of pesticides. Nutrient sources are not extensively formulated, but since nutrients are commonly incorporated in programmed pesticide applications, the spray additives (mostly adjuvants) used in the pesticide sprays will impact on the performance of the applied nutrients. The lack of uniform deposition over the fruit tree is a critical limitation; the lower quadrant next to the spray lane is frequently overdosed while the top and center are under sprayed. Fruit tree surfaces, except for some fruit surfaces, are not difficult to wet, thus droplet reflection is not a limiting factor. Surfactants, when used, reduce reflection, increase spreading (coverage) and, at high volume spraying, reduce the total dose retained per unit surface area. Residues from previous pesticide sprays and the presence of natural products (e.g., extrafloral nectar) on some plant surfaces modify spreading and retention. Droplet reflection, spreading, retention and nature of droplet residues are determined primarily by the physico-chemical properties of the spray solution together with plant surface morphology, fine structure (microroughness) and chemistry. The nature and distribution of spray droplet residues are important factors in performance of systemic compounds because penetration not only takes place from the droplet, but also from the remaining residue.",2002,NA,65,75,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.594.4

Human exposure to malaria vectors is reduced when IRS involves proper application of pre-determined concentrations of the active ingredient specific to the insecticide formulation of choice. The impact of IRS can be affected by the dosage of insecticide, spray coverage, vector behavior, vector susceptibility to insecticides, and the residual efficacy of the insecticide applied. This report compiles data on the residual efficacy of insecticides used in IRS campaigns implemented by the United States President's Malaria Initiative (PMI)/United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in 17 African countries and compares observed length of efficacy to ranges proposed in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Additionally, this study provides initial analysis on variation of mosquito mortality depending on the surface material of sprayed structures, country spray program, year of implementation, source of tested mosquitoes, and type of insecticide. Methods: Residual efficacy of the insecticides used for PMI/USAID-supported IRS campaigns was measured in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The WHO cone bioassay tests were used to assess the mortality rate of mosquitoes exposed to insecticide-treated mud, wood, cement, and other commonly used housing materials. Baseline tests were performed within weeks of IRS application and follow-up tests were continued until the mortality of exposed mosquitoes dropped below 80% or the program monitoring period ended. Residual efficacy in months was then evaluated with respect to WHO guidelines that provide suggested ranges of residual efficacy for insecticide formulations recommended for use in IRS. Where the data allowed, direct comparisons of mosquito mortality rates were then made to determine any significant differences when comparing insecticide formulation, country, year, surface type, and the source of the mosquitoes used in testing. Results: The residual efficacy of alpha-cypermethrin ranged from 4 to 10 months (average = 6.4 months), with no reported incidents of underperformance when compared to the efficacy range provided in WHO guidelines. Deltamethrin residual efficacy results reported a range of 1 to 10 months (average = 4.9 months), with two instances of underperformance. The residual efficacy of bendiocarb ranged from 2 weeks to 7 months (average = 2. 8 months) and failed to achieve proposed minimum efficacy on 14 occasions. Lastly, long-lasting pirimiphos-methyl efficacy ranged from 2 months to 9 months (average = 5.3 months), but reported 13 incidents of underperformance. Conclusions: Much of the data used to determine application rate and expected efficacy of insecticides approved for use in IRS programs are collected in controlled laboratory or pilot field studies. However, the generalizability of the results obtained under controlled conditions are limited and unlikely to account for variation in locally sourced housing materials, climate, and the myriad other factors that may influence the bio-efficacy of insecticides. Here, data are presented that confirm the variation in residual efficacy observed when monitoring household surfaces sprayed during PMI/USAID-supported IRS campaigns. All insecticides except alpha-cypermethrin showed evidence of failing to meet the minimum range of residual efficacy proposed in WHO criteria at least once. However, this initial effort in characterizing program-wide insecticide bio-efficacy indicates that some insecticides, such as bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl, may be vulnerable to variations in the local environment. Additionally, the comparative analysis performed in this study provides evidence that mosquito mortality rates differ with respect to factors including: the types of insecticide sprayed, surface material, geographical location, year of spraying, and tested mosquitoes. It is, therefore, important to locally assess the residual efficacy of insecticides on various surfaces to inform IRS programming.",2018,11,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2608-4

However, high volatility and moderate toxicity of this sulfide limit its application. To address these issues, a novel controlled release formulation of DMDS was proposed employing multiple emulsions and polyurea microcapsules (DMDS@MEs-MCs). The successful combination of the two technologies was revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier transform infrared. According to the multiple encapsulation structure, the encapsulation efficiency decreased by only 3.13% after thermal storage, compared with a 15.21% decrease of microcapsules made with only a monolayer film. DMDS@MEs-MCs could effectively control the release of active ingredient, which increased applicator and environmental safety during application. Moreover, it could be facilely used by spraying and drip irrigation instead of a special fumigation device. The innovative formulation exhibited better control efficacy on soil pathogens (Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp.) and root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) than DMDS technical concentration (DMDS TC). In addition, it did not inhibit seed germination after 10 days when the plastic film was removed from the fumigated soil.

We compared the impact of a neonicotinoid (clothianidin), a premix (clothianidin + bifenthrin), and an anthranilic diamide (chlorantraniliprole), the main insecticide classes used for multiple targeting, on four species of beneficial insects: Harpalus pennsylvanicus, an omnivorous ground beetle, Tiphia vernalis, an ectoparasitoid of scarab grubs, Copidosoma bakeri, a polyembryonic endoparasitoid of black cutworms, and Bombus impatiens, a native bumble bee. Ground beetles that ingested food treated with clothianidin or the premix suffered high mortality, as did C. bakeri wasps exposed to dry residues of those insecticides. Exposure to those insecticides on potted turf cores reduced parasitism by T. vernalis. Bumble bee colonies confined to forage on white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in weedy turf that had been treated with clothianidin or the premix had reduced numbers of workers, honey pots, and immature bees. Premix residues incapacitated H. pennsylvanicus and C. bakeri slightly faster than clothianidin alone, but otherwise we detected no synergistic or additive effects.

An important property of some bait formulations is secondary kill, whereby active ingredient (AI) is translocated in insect-produced residues throughout the cockroach population, especially affecting relatively sedentary early-instar nymphs. RESULTSB. germanica was collected from a location where baits containing hydramethylnon, fipronil or indoxacarb had become ineffective, and these AIs were topically applied to adult males. Results revealed the first evidence for hydramethylnon resistance, moderate resistance to fipronil and extremely high resistance to indoxacarb. Insecticide residues excreted by field-collected males that had ingested commercial baits effectively killed nymphs of an insecticide-susceptible laboratory strain of B. germanica but failed to kill most nymphs of the field-collected strain. CONCLUSIONSWe report three novel findings: (1) the first evidence for hydramethylnon resistance in any insect; (2) extremely high levels of indoxacarb resistance in a field population; (3) reduced secondary mortality in an insecticide-resistant field-collected strain of B. germanica. We suggest that, while secondary mortality is considered to be advantageous in cockroach interventions, the ingestion of sublethal doses of AI by nymphs may select for high insecticide resistance by increasing the frequency of AI resistance alleles within the population.

Mismatch between the frequency of pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes and the occurrence of pyrethroid-based insecticide applications for vector control is often hypothesized to be due to household use of commercial insecticide products. We experimentally quantified phenotypic and genotypic responses of four Ae. aegypti strains (three field, pyrethroid resistant, and one laboratory, pyrethroid susceptible) after exposure to two commonly used household aerosol insecticide products (a space spray and a residual spray formulation) containing pyrethroid active ingredients. Experiments were performed within homes of Merida, Mexico. After exposure to the products, all three pyrethroid resistant field Ae. aegypti strains had significantly lower mortality rates (averaging 41% and 50% for the two products, respectively) than the controls (99%). Applying insecticides as surface sprays led to a significant increase in the frequency of I1016 kdr homozygotes in surviving Ae. aegypti, suggesting strong selection pressure for this allele.

Nevertheless, questions regarding their safety are periodically raised. This review was undertaken to produce a current and comprehensive safety evaluation and risk assessment for humans. It includes assessments of glyphosate, its major breakdown product [aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)], its Roundup formulations, and the predominant surfactant [polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA)] used in Roundup formulations worldwide, The studies evaluated in this review included those performed for regulatory purposes as well as published research reports. The oral absorption of glyphosate and AMPA is low, and both materials are eliminated essentially unmetabolized. Dermal penetration studies with Roundup showed very low absorption. Experimental evidence has shown that neither glyphosate nor AMPA bioaccumulates in any animal tissue. No significant toxicity occurred in acute, subchronic, and chronic studies. Direct ocular exposure to the concentrated Roundup formulation can result in transient: irritation, while normal spray dilutions cause, at most, only minimal effects. The genotoxicity data for glyphosate and Roundup were assessed using a weight-of-evidence approach and standard evaluation criteria. There was no convincing evidence for direct DNA damage in vitro or in vivo and it was concluded that Roundup and its components do not pose a risk for the production of heritable/somatic mutations in humans, Multiple lifetime feeding studies have failed to demonstrate any tumorigenic potential for glyphosate. Accordingly, it was concluded that glyphosate is noncarcinogenic. Glyphosate, AMPA, and POEA were not teratogenic or developmentally toxic. There were no effects on fertility or reproductive parameters in two multigeneration reproduction studies with glyphosate, Likewise there were no adverse effects in reproductive tissues from animals treated with glyphosate, AMPA, or POEA in chronic and/or subchronic studies. Results from standard studies with these materials also failed to show any effects indicative of endocrine modulation. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of Roundup herbicide does not result in adverse effects on development, reproduction, or endocrine systems in humans and other mammals. For purposes of risk assessment, no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were identified for all subchronic, chronic, developmental, and reproduction studies with glyphosate, AMPA, and POEA. Margins-of-exposure for chronic risk were calculated for each compound by dividing the lowest applicable NOAEL by worst-case estimates of chronic exposure. Acute risks were assessed by comparison of oral LD50 values to estimated maximum acute human exposure. It was concluded that, under present and expected conditions of use, Roundup herbicide does not pose a health risk to humans.

Thousands of active ingredients and formulations of different pesticides are commercially available. Besides their advantages, a major disadvantage of pesticides is their residues, even though strict maximum residue limits have been set for each pesticide and permitted agricultural commodity. Permanence of pesticide residues on agricultural products depends on several factors such as the properties of pesticide, formulation, and applied concentration. Light, temperature, plant morphology, and plant growth factors are also effective in determining permanence. Degradation effects of the processing treatments rely on the dissolution of pesticides in the surrounding atmosphere, hydrolysis, microbial degradation, oxidation, penetration, and photo-degradation. Various steps applied during food processing, such as washing with water or other aqueous solutions, peeling, chopping, pickling, heat treatments, and processes such as drying, canning, fruit juice and concentrate production, malt, beer and wine production, oil production, and storage have certain effects on the presence of pesticide residues as well. Only washing with water can remove pesticide residue up to 100%, depending on the location of residue, residence time on food, water solubility of residue, washing temperature, and agents used to increase effectiveness. Besides washing, skin removal or peeling is one of the most effective treatments for residue removal, especially on non-systemic pesticides. During cooking, residues might be evaporated or hydrolyzed. Effects of storage temperature on reduction are related to volatilization, penetration, metabolism of pesticide, moisture content, and microbial growth, if any. In refrigerated or frozen storage, residues are stable or degrade slowly. Drying may increase the residue content because of the concentration, but in sun-drying reduction may occur because of photo-degradation. Clarification and filtration may eliminate residues retained in suspended particles. The degradation product, however, may be more toxic than the initial compound in some cases.",2020,60,3622,3641,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2019.1702501

For the R. microplus field trials, 20 bovines were selected by counting the semi-engorged females, and the therapeutic and residual efficacy was evaluated by taking tick counts at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56 dpt. Forty bovines that were naturally infested with Dermatobia hominis larvae were selected, and the numbers of larvae were counted by visual and tactile inspection on 3, 7, 14, 28, 35, 42 and 49 dpt. To address the efficacy on C. hominivorax larvae, two circular skin incisions (one on each side of the body) measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter each were made in 12 crossbred calves, and the natural exposure of the lesions to C. hominivorax infestations was then allowed. The incisions from the 12 animals were carefully examined daily from 1 to 10 dpt. Based on the PR results obtained for this pour-on combination containing fipronil 1.25 mg/kg + fluazuron 2.5 mg/kg, the maximum concentrations (C-max) and the half-lives (T-1/2) of these two active ingredients were detected on days 2, 5/6 and 19 (+/- 2)/24, 4 (+/- 3.5) days for fipronil and fluazuron, respectively. Furthermore, the combination showed higher therapeutic and residual efficacy against R. microplus (P <= 0.05) when compared with commercial standalone formulations that were administered separately. A high efficacy for this new combination was also found against C. hominivorax and D. hominis larvae (efficacy >= 99%). This study's results show that the combination of these two active ingredients, as opposed to their separate use, could represent a tool for extending the life cycle of these two molecules against cattle ectoparasites, especially R. microplus. Further studies would be desirable to further confirm this.",2017,66,627,634,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2017.05.005

We discuss their possible use to prevent major diseases and pests which infest potato and tomato, such as early and late blight, bacterial wilt, potato tuber moth, and tomato leafminer. There are several examples of the successful uses of botanicals for pathogen and pest control relevant for different African climatic conditions; however, most of these studies have been conducted in vitro and often lack field verification. Plant strengtheners (substances that induce and improve crop resistance, yield, and quality) are little studied and used in Africa in comparison to North America and Europe. The possible benefits of using botanicals and plant strengtheners instead of conventional pesticides are discussed here in relation to human health and the environment as well as their modes of action and accessibility to farmers. Lack of knowledge of the composition and active ingredients of extracts, environmental concerns, uncertainties regarding stability and formulation, lack of legislation and limited support from governments, hamper the development of botanicals and plant strengtheners for use in sustainable African agriculture.",2020,19,406,427,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(19)62703-6

Glyphosate, directly or indirectly, contaminates freshwater systems which in turn may be invaded by the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei. Under laboratory conditions, we studied the combined effect of technical-grade glyphosate, Roundup Max (R) and Glifosato Atanor (R), in scenarios with and without L. fortunei, on phytoplankton from Salto Grande Reservoir (Uruguay River, Argentina). We expected that the effects of the interaction on phytoplankton and water quality would vary with the form of herbicide applied. The assay was conducted for 14 days (TO using 3-L bottles as experimental units. Eight treatments were performed in triplicate: C: Control; M: mussel; G: technical grade glyphosate acid; R: Roundup Max (R); Glifosato Atanor (R); MG: mussel + technical-grade glyphosate acid, MA: mussel + Glifosato Atanor (R) and MR: mussel + Roundup Max (R). The active ingredient was applied at 6 ppm. The dissipation of glyphosate in water was 1.5-2.6 times higher in presence of mussels. Treatments G and A showed an increase in phytoplankton abundance, mainly the cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. with rised to 289% and 639% at Tf, respectively, relative to their values at Ti. Roundup Max (R) limited the growth of Microcystis spp., as its abundance decreased 59% relative to Ti. L. fortunei reduced phytoplankton abundances at Tf. Evenness increased significantly in M, MG, MR and MA, while it decreased in G, R and A relative to C. The interaction of factors produced a significant synergistic increase in periphyton; periphytic chlorophyll a concentration was 0.81 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MR; 0.09 +/- 0.02 mu g cm(-2) for MA and 0.02 +/- 0.01 mu g cm(-2) for MG.

In this study we hypothesized that the combination of commercial fungicides with certain enhancing agents could result in synergistic levels of control. Prior research has indicated that trans-cinnamic-acid (TCA), a metabolite of the bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens and metabolites of Xenorhabdus szentirmaii are particularly toxic to various phytpathogenic fungi when compared to metabolites of other Xenorhabdus or Photorhabdus spp. In this study we explored the efficacy of commercial fungicide interactions when combined with either TCA or X. szentirmaii. Fungicides (active ingredient) included Abound (R) (Azoxystrobin), Serenade (R) (Bacillus subtilis), Elast (R) (dodine), Regalia (extract of Reynoutria sachalinensis), Prophyt (R) (potassium phosphite) and PropiMax (R) (propiconazole). In laboratory experiments, singly-applied or combined agents were assessed for fungicidal activity against four plant-pathogenic fungi, Monilinia fructicola, Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Fusarium oxysporum. Fungicidal activity was measured by the phytopathogen's growth on potato dextrose agar with and without fungicide. The interactions between fungicidal agents were determined as antagonistic, additive or synergistic. For suppression of M. fructicola, synergy was observed between TCA when combined with certain concentrations of Elast (R), PropiMax (R), Regalia (R), Prophyte (R) or Serenade (R), and for combinations of X. szentirmaii with Abound (R). For suppression of R. solani, synergy was observed between TCA combined with Regalia or Serenade. Additionally, when TCA was combined with X. szentirmaii synergistic levels of suppression to M. fructicola were observed. Other combinations of TCA or X. szentirmaii with the fungicides or using alternate concentrations were either additive or occasionally antagonistic in nature. Our results indicate that TCA and X. szentirmaii can each act as strong synergists to enhance fungicidal efficacy. These results may be used to reduce negative environmental impacts of pesticide use while improving control of plant diseases. Additional research is needed to explore the diversity of the synergistic effects and confirm our observations under field conditions.",2017,145,1,8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2017.03.007

The active ingredient was applied at 10 doses as an acetone:water solution, without emulsifier, alone or in mixture with an ester of oleic acid (methyl, butyl, octyl, dodecanyl, octadecanyl). The plant response was described by a log-logistic regression model. Phenmedipham applied alone did clot kill the plants even at the highest dose (1621 g a.i. ha(-1)). In contrast, addition of any alkyl oleate to phenmedipham killed the plants at the 200-400 g a.i, ha(-1) doses. The alkyl oleates differently affected activity of phenmedipham. Their effects could be ranked as follows: butyl greater than or equal to methyl; octyl > methyl; dodecanyl I methyl; octadecanyl < methyl oleate.

(Dictyoptera: Blattellidae) and nymphs (stages 1, 3 and 6) were used to test the attractiveness and the feeding stimulation of several commercial gel formulations of insecticide food baits in laboratory binary choice tests. The four toxic gel baits tested were: 'Avert' (0.05% abamectin = avermectin B1), 'Drax' (33.3% boric acid), 'Goliath' (0.05% fipronil) and 'Maxforce' (2.15% hydramethylnon). The attractiveness of a bait was estimated by the number of cockroaches that chose it first, and by their tendency to change to it secondarily. Feeding stimulation was estimated by the mean duration of feeding bouts and total duration of food intake. Variability of these factors was assessed in relation to age of cockroaches and to age of baits. With a few exceptions, cockroach age did not affect performance in any of these tests. Attractiveness to B. germanica ranked 'Goliath' gel higher than 'Avert', 'Drax' and 'Maxforce' gels, whether or not the active ingredient fipronil was present in 'Goliath' gel. Feeding stimulation ranked 'Avert' and 'Maxforce' gels higher than 'Goliath' gel, and 'Drax' gel was inferior. With ageing up to 3 months, the feeding stimulation power of 'Goliath' and 'Maxforce' gels increased, whereas that of 'Avert' fluctuated.

Therefore-for interested parties and stakeholders-a common and controlled vocabulary of the potato domain that describes concepts, attributes, and the relations between them in a formal way using a standardised knowledge representation language is being developed: a potato ontology. The advantage is that all possible stakeholders will be able to understand the data expressed by this ontology and that software applications can process them automatically. It will also allow the application of advanced numerical techniques that may help to uncover previously unknown correlations. This version of the potato ontology aims at the domain of processing potatoes in a setting of mechanised potato production where growers have access to automated decision support systems and exchange data electronically. This paper describes the procedures to establish such an ontology where competency questions formulated by stakeholders and potential users take a central position. The potato ontology formally describes Concepts or Classes. The three main classes are those used in crop ecology: Crop, Environment and Management. Classes, e. g., biocides are a subclass of agrochemicals, and in turn have a subclass Fungicides. The ontology also describes the Properties of classes, e. g., agrochemicals are produced synthetically in a factory; biocides are used to protect crops and fungicides to control fungi. The ontology also describes the Attributes (properties) of the concepts, e. g., all agrochemicals have attributes such as dose and time of application and mode of application. Restrictions may be that a particular chemical can only be applied with a certain type of equipment, or its application is restricted to a certain period or dose.

C. gloesporioides is a fungus pathogen causing antrachnose disease in red dragon fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus). The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of E. slahmong rhizome oil, B/2 and D/4 essential oil (EO) fractions, using the similar method as in previous research; describe the chemical compounds of E. slahmong EO from its rhizome oil, B/2 and D/4 fractions; and compare these chemical compounds with compounds in EO from leaf oil, A/1 and C/3 fractions (the subject of previous research). Research was conducted at the laboratory of disease and pest of Laing Research Station of Bogor Research Institute For Spice and Medicinal Plant, Solok West Sumatra Indonesia. The research method followed three stages: (a) suppressing colony diameter using rhizome oil, B/2 and D/4 fraction (concentration levels: 0, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 ppm), (b) suppressing colony biomass using rhizome oil, B/2 and D/4 fraction (concentration levels: 0, 100, 250, 500 dan 1000 ppm), and (c) suppressing colony diameter using volatile compounds from rhizome oil, B/2 and D/4 fraction (dose level: 0; 0,01 ml; 0,025ml; 0,05ml and 0,1 ml/petri dish).

There are several formulations based on the active ingredient glyphosate (GLY) used along with other chemicals to improve the absorption and penetration in plants. The final composition of commercial GBH may modify GLY toxicological profile, potentially enhancing its neurotoxic properties. The developing nervous system is particularly susceptible to insults occurring during the early phases of development, and exposure to chemicals in this period may lead to persistent impairments on neurogenesis and differentiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-lasting effects of a sub-cytotoxic concentration, 2.5 parts per million of GBH and GLY, on the differentiation of human neuroepithelial stem cells (NES) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). We treated NES cells with each compound and evaluated the effects on key cellular processes, such as proliferation and differentiation in daughter cells never directly exposed to the toxicants. We found that GBH induced a more immature neuronal profile associated to increased PAX6, NESTIN and DCX expression, and a shift in the differentiation process toward glial cell fate at the expense of mature neurons, as shown by an increase in the glial markers GFAP, GLT1, GLAST and a decrease in MAP2. Such alterations were associated to dysregulation of key genes critically involved in neurogenesis, including PAX6, HES1, HES5, and DDK1. Altogether, the data indicate that subtoxic concentrations of GBH, but not of GLY, induce long-lasting impairments on the differentiation potential of NES cells.",2022,37,2044,2057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.23549

These pesticides are as follows: one type of triazine herbicide Ametryn and one type of carbamate insecticide (Applaud) and two types of chlorinated organic pesticides, Aldrin and Chlorothalonil. Factors affecting the radiolysis of these pesticides such as the pesticide concentration, irradiation dose, dose rate and pH of the solutions were studied. Ametryn, Applaud, Chlorothalonil and Aldrin insecticides were degraded by gamma-radiation and in the case of the chlorinated pesticides hydrochloric acid was detected. The pH effect has proved to vary according to the type of the pesticide and little degradation was observed in alkaline medium, while more degradation of the pesticides in the neutral medium was observed depending on the type of pesticide and on its chemical structure. However, the degradation in the acid medium was even higher. A drop in pH was observed and may be attributed to the degradation of the pesticide molecules to lower molecular weight compounds, such as organic acids. A combined treatment of gamma irradiation and conventional methods was applied and the effect of different additives such as nitrogen and oxygen showed that nitrogen did not enhance the degradation, while an enhancement in the degradation process was observed when oxygen was added. Experiments on the adsorption of these pesticides on certain polymeric materials and on Granular Activated Carbon (GAC), showed that GAC has the highest adsorption capacity. It may be concluded that the radiation degradation followed by adsorption of the toxic pesticide pollutants and their removal from wastewater down to concentrations not exceeding the maximum permissible concentration (MPC), according to international standards, proved to be better than the conventional methods of purification.",1999,49,521,533,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10582-999-0071-y

For the field trials, the amount of trifluralin persisting over 1 year into the next cropping season varied from 9 to 24%. From laboratory experiments, separate relationships were derived for the effects of temperature and moisture on trifluralin degradation. Trifluralin degradation increased with both increasing moisture and increasing temperature. The results indicate potential for unusually long persistence of trifluralin in years of low rainfall when the soil becomes very dry. It is therefore recommended that analysis for trifluralin residues or activity be undertaken if a sensitive crop such as oat, sorghum, or millet, or a sensitive pasture species such as phalaris or ryegrass, is sown after very dry climatic conditions following trifluralin application. The wheatbelt regions of Australia do not experience cold conditions for long enough periods for low temperatures to be a major factor contributing to trifluralin persistence. Degradation was compared for trifluralin applied as a formulation of the herbicide and as the active ingredient alone, to determine the validity of results obtained using the pure herbicide. In half of the 6 field and laboratory studies, there was a statistically significant difference between degradation of trifluralin as the active ingredient and as the formulation.

Results of the thermal stability assay showed that the degradation rate of CP in 14-day incubation was slowed by a factor of 3.6 when it was complexed with beta-CD. Then, activity and toxicity of CP influenced by the encapsulated process of P-CD were evaluated by an in vitro acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition assay and an acute aquatic toxicity assay, respectively. No significant differences were found in both the two biological assays by a t-test.

It was established that the agricultural market and the pesticide market in particular grow by an average of 3% annually. But over the past 30 years, no new mechanisms of action of herbicides have been invented. This hinders the emergence of new active substances, which may be part of new drugs of this type. Therefore, due to its innovativeness and own production, the company is developing a new formulation of the already existing drug in the herbicide group. It is noted that it is appropriate to plan the launch of a new goods in the herbicide group using the SOSTAC model. According to this model, clear goals are set that the company must achieve during the year. Business growth strategies selected: 1) market penetration strategy (means that growth will occur in the direction of increasing the share of the current product market; can be used when the market is not yet saturated, advantages over competitors can be obtained as a result of lower production costs, more active advertising); 2) product development strategy (means that the source of the company's growth is the growth in demand for new products; the creation of new product modifications for existing markets). It is emphasized that the implementation of both strategies should be carried out simultaneously in synergy, which will allow covering the maximum number of market needs, increasing the loyalty of existing customers and attracting new consumers of the company's products. It is determined that when launching a new goods to market, the company can set the upper or lower level for each of the marketing variables - price, promotion, distribution and quality of the goods. Taking into account the peculiarities of the new goods the use of the tactics of quick skimming will be the most optimal and acceptable option to achieve the company's goals. Its use is advisable in cases where the market size is small, most potential buyers are aware of the quality characteristics of the product and are ready to pay a high price for it (that is, innovative buyers), while there are few potential competitors. If most consumers in a small market have little idea of the product, then measures should be taken to inform them. Then a high price, combined with intense stimulus, can ensure the quick conquest of part of the market. Considering the above, the article developed tactical solutions and compiled a marketing budget for the launch of a new goods to the consumer market.

Principal-component (PC) analysis identified five PCs that account for 77% of the total variance in 14 organochlorine compounds in the original dataset. The five PCs represent: (1) chlordane-related compounds and dieldrin; (2) p,p'-DDT and its clegraclates; (3) o,p'-DDT and its clegraclates; (4) the pesticide clegraclates oxychlordane and heptachlor epoxide; and (5) PCBs. The PC analysis grouped compounds that have similar chemical structure (such as parent compound and degradate), common origin (in the same technical pesticide mixture), and(or) similar relation of concentrations to land use. For example, the highest concentrations of chlordane compounds and dieldrin occurred at urban sites, reflecting past use of parent pesticides for termite control. Two approaches to characterizing mixtures-PC-based mixtures and unique mixtures-were applied to all 299 samples with a detection of two or more organochlorine compounds. PC-based mixtures are defined by the presence (in the sample) of one or more compounds associated with that PC. Unique mixtures are defined as a specific combination of two or more compounds detected in a sample. regardless of how many other compounds were also detected in that sample. The simplest PC-based mixtures (containing compounds from 1 or 2 PCs) commonly occurred in a variety of land use settings. Complex mixtures (containing compounds from 3 or more PCs) were most common in samples from urban and mixed/urban sites, especially in the Northeast, reflecting high concentrations of multiple chlordane, dieldrin, DDT-related compounds, and(or) PCBs. The most commonly occurring unique mixture (p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD) occurred in both simple and complex PC-based mixtures, and at both urban and agricultural sites. Mean Probable Effect Concentration Quotients (PEC-Q) values, which estimate the potential toxicity of organochlorine contaminant mixtures, were highest for complex mixtures. Mean PEC-Q values were highest for urban sites in the Northeast, followed by mixed/urban sites in the Northeast and agricultural sites in cotton growing areas. These results demonstrate that the PEC-Q approach can be used in combination with PC-based and unique mixture analyses to relate potential aquatic toxicity of contaminant mixtures to mixture complexity, land use, and other surrogates for contaminant sources.

Development of suitable formulations and production processes are necessary to obtain high-quality products easily adopted by farmers. A detailed unit operation study was carried out for the production process of a Phthorimaea operculella granulovirus-based biopesticide to control the tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta, one of the most important pests affecting this crop. Physicochemical, microbiological, and insecticidal parameters were implemented in the process and applied to the finished product, and a scaling strategy was developed. A Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-PCR) technique was implemented to quantify viral concentrations in the active ingredient (5.34 +/- 1.44 x10(9) Occlusion Bodies mL(-1)) and in the finished product (>1.6x10(9) OB mL(-1)), without contaminant interferences. The Q-PCR methodology was also useful to select the appropriate solid mixing time following Lacey's mixing index (8 min). Factors and similarity principles influencing the liquid mixing process were identified in the scaling evaluation. Furthermore, the drying kinetics analysis enabled identifying a drying temperature of 35 degrees C, with an efficacy under controlled conditions higher than 97%. Contaminant concentration was lower than 1%, indicating controlled and aseptic formulation process conditions. A simple statistical method was used to estimate the reproducibility and repeatability of the parameters assessed in the finished product.

The climate there is semi-arid with mild winters and hot, rainless summers. Potatoes are grown in two growing seasons, autumn and spring. Two foliar diseases, early blight (caused by Alternaria solani) and late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans), threaten the crop and if not managed properly, may induce substantial yield losses. However, since late blight is potentially more destructive than early blight, more efforts are devoted to its suppression. Concepts for the integration of genotype resistance, age-related resistance and fungicide type for the suppression of both early and late blights were developed based on the epidemiology of the pathogens and in relation to their interactions with the host. The concepts were formulated in a holistic framework named the integrated management strategy. The integrated management strategy was evaluated in 7 field experiments from 1994 to 1998; 4 of which were conducted in the autumn season and 3 in the spring season. Both early and late blights developed in all experiments at various levels of intensity. Analysis of disease progress curves revealed that in plots managed according to the integrated management concepts early blight was suppressed as good as in plots treatment with a specific fungicide against A. solani, and late blight was suppressed as good as in plots treated with specific fungicides against P. infestans. Less sprays and lower quantities of fungicidal active ingredient were applied in plots treated according to the integrated management strategy. Yield in the integrated management treatment did not differ, or was significantly higher, than yield in the other control treatments. Potato growers in the northern Negev region currently implement the concepts of the integrated management strategy.",1999,NA,247,255,NA

Measured pesticide concentrations were 26 to 34% lower than nominal concentrations; therefore, all results are expressed in terms of measured active ingredient. Carbosulfan was relatively non-toxic to the mussel larvae with median effective concentrations (EC50) of carbosulfan at 24 and 48 h greater than 0.10 mg/L. The EC(50)s of chlorpyrifos at 24 and 48 h were 0.083 and 0.078 mg/L, respectively (measured concentrations). The 48-h EC50 of a combined exposure to a mixture of chlorpyrifos and carbosulfan at a constant ratio of 2.9:1 was 0.0142:0.049 mg CP:CB/L. In a separate experiment, the effect of water hardness on carbosulfan, chlorpyrifos, or a combined exposure was assessed using glochidia exposed to either soft, moderately hard, or hard reconstituted water. There was no effect of water hardness on the survival of glochidia after 24- or 48-h exposure to carbosulfan. The chlorpyrifos 48-h EC(50)s in soft water, moderately hard water, and hard water were 0.18, 0.11, and 0.16 mg/L, respectively.

The basic formulation [sodium alginate (1.40%)-atrazine (0.60%)-water] was modified by the addition of sorbents. The effect on atrazine release rate caused by the incorporation of acid-treated bentonite (0.5 and 2.5 M H2SO4) in alginate formulation was studied by immersion of the granules in water under static conditions. The water uptake, sorption capacity of the sorbent, permeability, and time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water, t(50), were calculated for the comparison of the preparations. t(50) values were longer for those formulations containing acid-treated bentonite (36.78 and 29.01 days for 0.5 and 2.5 M H2SO4 treatments, respectively) than for the preparation without bentonite (9.69 days). On the basis of a parameter of an empirical equation used to fit the herbicide release data, it appears that the release of atrazine from the various formulations into water is controlled by diffusion mechanism. The sorption capacity of the sorbents and the permeability of the formulations (ranging from 4.99 to 20.83 mg day(-1) mm(-1)) were the most important factors affecting herbicide release.",2004,52,3888,3893,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf030833j

The susceptibility level of beetles to these insecticides can be dependent on active ingredient, population treated, formulation, surface treated and timing of observation. The susceptibility of adult beetles from six populations to-cyfluthrin was determined up to 48 h after exposure. The susceptibility of adult beetles to the label rate of-cyfluthrin and permethrin formulations on concrete, wood-chip-type particle board and pressure-treated wood was determined up to 48 h post-exposure. RESULTS: Variation in LC50 values at 2 and 24 h was found within and between beetle populations from two regions of Texas. The permethrin formulation had lower mean mortality than the-cyfluthrin formulation on all surfaces tested. The permethrin formulation had high levels of recovery on all surfaces tested after 2 h. Surface affected the efficacy of the insecticides tested on killing adult beetles. CONCLUSION: Permethrin-based insecticide had lower knockdown and persistence on various surfaces over time than-cyfluthrin-based insecticide. Beetle recovery in less susceptible populations may necessitate longer observation periods for efficacy evaluations. Our study also shows that surfaces chosen can affect the efficacy of the compound on killing adult beetles.(C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry",2017,73,562,567,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.4327

However, the possible environmental effects related to the growth of this activity in the last years have not been studied enough. Particularly, the effects of pesticides mixtures are a topic of great concern both for society and regulatory authorities worldwide, given the possible additive and synergistic relationships between these chemicals and their possible effects on aquatic biota. Based on a concentration addition model, this study developed an Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) of pesticides from freshwater ecosystems in the Pampas region. For this purpose, reported pesticides concentrations available in public bibliography and a Risk Quotients (RQs) approach were used. A cumulative risk map was established to display RQs for current use pesticides (CUPs) and legacy chemicals. The Sigma RQs were calculated for 66 sites, using available reported measured environmental concentrations (MECs) and predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) of pesticides. While Sigma RQ for only CUPs resulted in a high and very high risk (Sigma RQ > 1) for 29% of the sites, when legacy pesticides were incorporated this percentage reached the 41% of the sites, increasing significantly the absolute values of RQ. Herbicides like glyphosate and atrazine contributed considerably to the Sigma RQ(CUPs) while organochlorines were the major contributors for Sigma RQs when legacy pesticides were incorporated. Moreover, some active ingredients (acetochlor, carbendazim and fenitrothion) which are approved for their use in Argentina but banned in EU showed high contribution to Sigma RQ(CUPs). The present study is the first attempt to develop an ERA in surface water of the Pampas region of Argentina and it provides a starting point for a more comprehensive pesticides monitoring and a further risk assessment program.

Plant essential oil-based insecticides are new, effective, and eco-friendly alternatives. Today, they are a housefly control method of choice. The study evaluated the insecticidal effect against M. domestica adults of essential oils (EOs) from Cymbopogon citratus (Stapf.), Illicium verum Hook. f., and Myristica fragrans (Houtt.) as well as their major active chemical constituents. Formulations of these individual and combined compounds were evaluated to see whether they were synergistic against M. domestica. Chemical compositions of these EOs were also analyzed by GC-MS. The major constituent of C. citratus was found to be geranial (45.4 %); that of I. verum was trans-anethole (94.0 %), and that of M. fragrans was alpha-pinene (21.6 %). Formulation CB3 (0.5 % I. verum EO + 0.5 % geranial) exhibited the highest synergistic effect (SI = 0.04), with 100 % knockdown and mortality rates, a 50 % knockdown time (KT50) of 4.0 min, and a 50 % lethal time (LT50) of 6.0 min.

The fungicides contained carbendazim or a mixture of propiconazole and fenpropimorph as their active ingredients and were applied at 1 x and 100 x the rate recommended for field use. Hyphal compartments (HCs; soil cylinders completely surrounded by nylon mesh of 25 mum mesh size) were buried between two rows of peas. The soil inside these HCs was labelled with P-32 to distinguish hyphal P uptake from inside the HCs from overall P uptake, Fungicides were added to the soil inside the HCs at concentrations assumed to reflect their concentration in the surrounding soil. At two harvests, plant growth, total P and P-32 uptake as well as root length density and AM root colonisation were measured. Length of hyphae inside the HCs was measured at the final harvest. Both carbendazim and the propiconazole/fenpropimorph-mixture stimulated hyphal P uptake from inside HCs when applied at rates recommended for normal field use, This increase in hyphal P uptake was significant only in the case of carbendazim. A negative effect of the fungicides on other components of the soil microbial community with which AM fungi interact is considered the most likely explanation for the observed stimulation in hyphal P uptake. Hyphal P uptake was completely inhibited by application of carbendazim at 100 x the recommended rate, Plant growth and overall P uptake were not affected by fungicide applications apart from application of the propiconazole/fenpropimorph mixture at 100 x the recommended rate. This rate completely inhibited plant growth. AM root colonisation was reduced by the high rate of carbendazim application only. This reduction had no effect on plant growth which may be due to the fertile soil conditions at the field site. It is concluded that the testing for side effects of pesticides on non-target organisms should include functional parameters such as P uptake by AM fungi. Such measures may be more sensitive to harmful effects than measures of plant growth or biomass. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Low-volume spraying operations require more efficient deposition of droplets on the target surface. Therefore, pesticide deposition and retention on plant surfaces is a serious challenge for modern precision agriculture. Tank-mix adjuvants have been used to improve spray dilutions performance; however, their effects on the physicochemical properties of spray dilutions, dosage delivery, and pesticide dosage are unclear. RESULTS Tank-mix adjuvant 8860 significantly improved the physicochemical properties of spray dilutions, inhibited spray droplets rebound, improved the wetting and spreading performance of spray dilutions on wheat leaves, and increased the effective deposition of tebuconazole on wheat leaves. Even when its dosage was reduced by one-third, the spray solution still showed excellent disease control and effective deposition of the active ingredient on wheat leaves. CONCLUSION The use of appropriate tank-mix adjuvants in UAV-based plant protection for wheat can significantly improve the performance of spray dilutions, increase the efficiency of pesticide dosage delivery, and improve disease control. These adjuvants can also help reduce the pesticide use while ensuring their effectiveness. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",2022,78,2512,2522,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6879

A field study was conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln: West Central Research and Extension Center Dryland Farm near North Platte, NE in 2011 and 2012 to determine efficacy of herbicide active ingredients when applied by a ULV sprayer compared to a conventional sprayer. The effect of four drift reducing adjuvants on glyphosate efficacy with an ULV sprayer at two pressures was also evaluated. Ten active ingredients with each sprayer and an untreated check (21 total treatments) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The ten herbicides chosen were glyphosate, glufosinate, 2,4-D ester, dicamba, atrazine, saflufenacil, mesotrione, chloransulam-methyl, sodium salt of bentazon, and clethodim. Additionally, four drift reducing adjuvants, a glyphosate check and an untreated check were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The four adjuvants selected were hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), polyethylene oxide (PEO), methylated soybean oil (MSO), and glycerin. Treatments were applied across a 12 row plot planted to six different plant species.

K-Othrine(R) is an IRS based on the pyrethroid deltamethrin and is widely used against mosquitoes that transmit malaria. SumiShield (TM) 50WG is an IRS based on the insecticide clothianidin, developed to kill mosquitoes that have become resistant to other forms of insecticide. These products were applied to cement, wood, and mud tiles, representative of typical building materials in areas where malaria is endemic. For 18 months, the ability of these treated surfaces to kill adult female mosquitoes exposed to them was measured. The clothianidin IRS was highly effective against insecticide susceptible and resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus, key malaria vector species, with an improved performance compared to deltamethrin IRS, though was not so effective against Aedes aegypti or Culex quinquefasciatus. Both IRS formulations were shown to be more effective and long-lasting on cement and mud than on wood tiles. Insecticides with novel modes of action are required to complement the pyrethroids currently relied upon for controlling malaria vectors. One example of this is the neonicotinoid clothianidin, the active ingredient in the indoor residual spray (IRS) SumiShield (TM) 50WG. In a preliminary experiment, the mortality of insecticide-susceptible and resistant An. gambiae adults exposed to filter papers treated with this IRS product reached 80% by 3 days post-exposure and 100% by 6 days post-exposure. Next, cement, wood, and mud tiles were treated with the clothianidin or a deltamethrin-based IRS formulation (K-Othrine WG250). Insecticide resistant and susceptible Anopheles and Aedes were exposed to these surfaces periodically for up to 18 months. Pyrethroid resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus was also exposed at 9 months. Between exposures, tiles were stored in heat and relative humidity conditions reflecting those found in the field. On these surfaces, the clothianidin IRS was effective at killing both susceptible and resistant An. gambiae for 18 months post-treatment, while mortality amongst the resistant strains when exposed to the deltamethrin IRS was not above that of the negative control. Greater efficacy of clothianidin was also demonstrated against insecticide resistant strains of An. funestus compared to deltamethrin, though the potency was lower when compared with An. gambiae. In general, higher efficacy of the clothianidin IRS was observed on cement and mud compared to wood, though it demonstrated poorer residual activity against Ae.aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus.",2022,13,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13020112

Both fungicides were applied as ca 0.2-mu-l droplets of aqueous suspension formulations containing 0.5 g litre-1 of C-14-labelled active ingredient; surfactants were added to these suspensions at concentrations ranging from 0.2-10 g litre-1. To achieve optimum uptake of each fungicide the use of surfactants with different physicochemical properties was required. For diclobutrazol, a lipophilic compound, uptake of radiolabel was best with surfactants of low mean molar ethylene oxide (E) content (5-6) but it was necessary to use concentrations of ca 5 g litre-1 to attain this. The surfactant threshold concentration for uptake enhancement of radiolabel from ethirimol formulations (< 1 g litre-1) was much lower than that for diclobutrazol but surfactants with E contents > 10 induced the greatest amount of uptake. For both fungicides, surfactants with an aliphatic alcohol hydrophobe were generally more efficient in promoting their uptake than those with a nonylphenol moiety. The sorbitan-based surfactant 'Tween 20' proved to be an effective adjuvant only for the ethirimol formulation; the uptake enhancing properties of the block copolymer 'Synperonic PE/F68' were weak. Uptake performance could not be related to the spreading properties of the respective formulations on the wheat leaf surface or to differences in solubilisation of the two fungicides by the surfactants. Although surfactants could substantially increase the amount of acropetal transport of radiolabel from both fungicides, none of those tested specifically promoted it; a constant proportion of the radioactive dose absorbed by a treated leaf was usually exported away from the site of application. The results are discussed in the light of current theories about the mode of action of surfactants as spray adjuvants.",1992,34,109,118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2780340204

Initially developed to control the growth of weed species in agriculture, this herbicide also plays an important role in both modern silviculture and domestic weed control. The creation of glyphosate tolerant crop species has significantly increased the demand and use of this herbicide and has also increased the risk of exposure to non-target species. Commercially available glyphosate-based herbicides are comprised of multiple, often proprietary, constituents, each with a unique level of toxicity. Surfactants used to increase herbicide efficacy have been identified in some studies as the chemicals responsible for toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides to non-target species, yet they are often difficult to chemically identify. Most glyphosate-based herbicides are not approved for use in the aquatic environment; however, measurable quantities of the active ingredient and surfactants are detected in surface waters, giving them the potential to alter the physiology of aquatic organisms. Acute toxicity is highly species dependant across all taxa, with toxicity depending on the timing, magnitude, and route of exposure. The toxicity of glyphosate to amphibians has been a major focus of recent research, which has suggested increased sensitivity compared with other vertebrates due to their life history traits and reliance on both the aquatic and terrestrial environments. This review is designed to update previous reviews of glyphosate-based herbicide toxicity, with a focus on recent studies of the aquatic toxicity of this class of chemicals.

These variables were analyzed according to reduction of arthropod density in canopy trees after treatments and results were compared with a control plot (plot A) without application. The plot sprayed in 1988, with a dust formulation of cypermethrin at 75 g active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (plot B), showed a nearly 100% mortality of lepidopteran larvae, the most important food resource for breeding blue tits, as well as for other arthropods. The drop in food supply in this plot coincided with the hatching or early nestling stage of the blue tit population. There were statistically significant differences between the control plot and plot B in nestling mortality, daily survival rate, nest success, and nestling weight. In the treated plot, nestling mortality was 81%, 65% of nests were unsuccessful, and mean nestling weight was 1 g less than that in the control plot. In the control plot, nestling mortality was 6% and all nests were successful. A second plot was sprayed in 1989 with an ultra-low-volume formulation of cypermethrin at 3.75 g a.i. per hectare, reducing 90% of the caterpillars but not affecting the availability of other arthropods. Blue tit nestlings were older than one week at the moment of the spraying. In this plot, nestlings from late nests showed a higher mortality and a lower daily survival rate than those in the control plot, the only statistically significant differences in breeding parameters between the plots. We suggest that the negative effects of cypermethrin spraying on breeding success of the blue tit in both treated plots are due to indirect effects (shortage in prey availability) rather than to direct effects (toxicity).",1992,11,1271,1280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620110907

The house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.), was used as an indicator species for medium- to large-bodied ground dwelling insects. The 24-h LC50 values for Permanone(A (R)) (formulated product of permethrin), Permanone + piperonyl butoxide (PBO), technical grade permethrin, and technical grade permethrin + PBO ranged from 0.052 to 0.9 mu g/cm(2). The 24 h LC50 for technical grade naled and Trumpet(A (R)) (formulated product of naled) were 0.038 and 0.44 mu g/cm(2), respectively. The synergist ratio was 2.65 for Permanone + PBO and 1.57 for technical grade permethrin + PBO. The toxicity of technical grade permethrin was about 10-fold greater than Permanone. A risk assessment using modeled estimated environmental concentrations resulted in risk quotients (RQ) that exceeded regulatory levels of concern, but when compared to field-derived actual environmental concentrations RQs did not exceed a regulatory level of concern, except in the case of technical grade naled. These results were expected because higher tiered risk assessments using field-verified data generally lead to lower risk estimates. Field bioassays using caged crickets showed no significant mortality for permethrin or naled after a single truck-mounted ULV application. The results of the risk assessment using actual environmental concentrations are supported by the field bioassays and suggest that a single ULV application of synergized or unsynergized permethrin and naled most likely will not result in population impacts on medium- to large-bodied insects.",2010,19,1140,1146,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-010-0497-9

Surfactants are used to improve the biological efficacy of foliar-applied herbicides. However, questions have been raised about the safety of the commonly used active ingredients and surfactants. As a consequence of the increasing pesticide safety demands and restrictive regulatory limitations on pesticide use, researchers are looking for new adjuvants with improved biological and ecotoxicological profiles. With this in mind a newer group of vegetable oils, namely rapeseed oil ethoxylates (RSO), was studied. Rapeseed oils with 5 (RSO 5), 10 (RSO 10), 20 (RSO 20), 30 (RSO 30), and 60 (RSO 60) ethoxylation units were added to glyphosate spray solutions and applied to different weed species (Amaranthus retroflexus, Datura stramonium, Setaria viridis, Viola arvensis). The influence of these oils on spray retention as well as the biological efficacy of glyphosate was examined, using electron microscopy, spectroscopy, chlorophyll fluorescence, and dry matter determination. Scanning electron microscopy pictures of the weed leaf surfaces were taken and displayed fundamental differences in the epidermal, cuticular and epicuticular structures of the leaf surfaces. Beside different habits and leaf structures these results were regarded as reasons for quantitative differences in the mean spray solution deposited. Further tests demonstrated that there was no correlation between retention behaviour and biological efficacy. Maximum chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed similar or higher impact of glyphosate when rapeseed oils were added in comparison with a treatment of Roundup Ultramax (R). Good correlation was shown between hydrophilicity/ethoxylation of the solution and dry matter content. In D. stramonium and V. arvensis increasing ethoxylation led to decreasing dry mass. The opposite could be shown in S. viridis. Amaranthus retroflexus had the lowest dry mass when glyphosate was applied with RSO 20. The rapeseed oil ethoxylates used showed promising impacts on glyphosate spray solutions but further studies need to be undertaken to clarify other processes of the foliar application of pesticides.",2005,79,17,23,NA

Vector control using residual spraying or application to livestock is recommended by many authorities to reduce BTV transmission; however, the impact of these measures in terms of both inflicting mortality on Culicoides and subsequently upon BTV transmission is unclear. This study consisted of a standardized World Health Organization laboratory assay to determine the susceptibility of European Culicoides species to deltamethrin and a field trial based upon allowing individuals of a laboratory strain of Culicoides nubeculosus Meigen to feed upon sheep treated with Butox 7.5 pour-on (a deltamethrin-based topical formulation). Susceptibility in the laboratory trial was higher in colony C. nubeculosus (24-hLC(90) = 0.00106%), than in field populations of Culicoides obsoletus Meigen (24-h LC90 = 0.00203%) or Culicoides imicola Kieffer (24-h LC90 = 0.00773%). In the field, the pour-on formulation was tested with a total of 816 C. nubeculosus specimens fed upon on the thigh of treated sheep. The study revealed a maximum mortality rate of 49% at 4 d postapplication, and duration of lethal effect was predicted to be as short as 10 d, despite testing being carried out with a highly susceptible strain. The reasons for this low efficacy are discussed with reference both to the potential for lack of spread of the active ingredient on the host and feeding patterns of the major potential vector species on the sheep host. Practical implications for vector control strategies during BTV incursions are also detailed.",2011,48,351,357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME10178

In vitro diffusion methodology was used to investigate the transport of a systemic fungicide, tebuconazole, over a model silicone membrane, enzymatically isolated cuticle membranes, and dermatomed leaves. It was shown that dermatomed leaves may replace enzymatically isolated cuticles. Furthermore, the effects of two surfactants, C10EO7 and C(8)G(1.6), on the fungicide transport were investigated. Tebuconazole cuticle permeation was described using Fick's first law of diffusion, expressed by the thermodynamic activity of the solute in the membrane. A new method for calculation of diffusion coefficients in the membrane is proposed. To access the thermodynamic activity of the fungicide in the membranes, sorption isotherms of tebuconazole in the membrane materials studied were recorded. The thermodynamic activity of the fungicide in aqueous solutions was calculated from solubility data. For that purpose, the effect of surfactants on tebuconazole solubility was studied. The results show that addition of surfactants allows for higher concentrations of tebuconazole available for penetration. Nonetheless, at a fixed fungicide thermodynamic activity, all formulations produced the same flux over the silicone membrane independently on the fungicide concentration. This shows that the driving force across non-responding membranes is the gradient of thermodynamic activity, rather than the gradient of the fungicide concentration. In case of leaves, surfactants induced the same quantitative increase in both flux and diffusion coefficient of solute in the cuticle, while the cuticle-water partition coefficient was unaffected.

Adverse impacts of nanofertilizers on soil microflora were reported in past studies, but only considering a single application. Repeated applications are however more likely to occur in agriculture. We investigated effects of single versus repeated applications of a copper hydroxide nanofertilizer formulation (NFF) on soil enzyme activity and bacterial community. One or three applications were performed within 21 days to achieve same final level of Cu in soil (48 mg(Cu)/kg: the recommended dose of NFF). Besides, the active ingredient (i.e., copper hydroxide nanotubes (NT)) and dispersing agent (DA) of NFF, and an ionic fertilizer (i.e., CuSO4) were examined. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and urease (URE) showed negligible changes in the activities between the control and DA treatment. Bacterial community abundance, composition and diversity exhibited similar phenomena. Exposures to copper hydroxide NFF and NT or CuSO4 enhanced the activities of FDAse and NAG, weakened the activity of URE, and showed negligible changes in the LAP activity irrespective of single and repeated applications. Concentrations of NO3--N and NH4+-N in soil were also affected by the application mode of NFF. More importantly, responses of soil bacterial community to copper hydroxide NFF were highly dependent on its application mode, whereas similar responses were observed in the CuSO4 treatment regardless of single or repeated applications. This study provided new insights into environmental risk of copper hydroxide NFF that were ignored in previous studies using a single exposure. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The declared active ingredient glyphosate does not only inhibit the EPSPS but is also a chelating agent that binds macro- and micronutrients, essential for many plant processes and pathogen resistance. GBH treatment may thus impede uptake and availability of macro- and micronutrients in plants. The present study investigated whether this characteristic of glyphosate could contribute to adverse effects of GBH application in the environment and to human health. According to the results, it has not been fully elucidated whether the chelating activity of glyphosate contributes to the toxic effects on plants and potentially on plant-microorganism interactions, e.g., nitrogen fixation of leguminous plants. It is also still open whether the chelating property of glyphosate is involved in the toxic effects on organisms other than plants, described in many papers. By changing the availability of essential as well as toxic metals that are bound to soil particles, the herbicide might also impact soil life, although the occurrence of natural chelators with considerably higher chelating potentials makes an additional impact of glyphosate for most metals less likely. Further research should elucidate the role of glyphosate (and GBH) as a chelator, in particular, as this is a non-specific property potentially affecting many organisms and processes.

Mixture studies with pesticides are performed to assess compatibility, combined efficacy, and potential for toxicological interactions that damage crops. The purpose of this paper is to review and recommend previously published scientific criteria for evaluating the quality, relevance and interpretability of data on toxicological interactions and to demonstrate a methodology for applying them objectively to mixtures studies used in ecological risk assessment. The recommended criteria reflect the consensus of the literature on interaction analysis from decades of research in pharmacology and toxicology and are broadly applicable to mixtures of drugs, pesticides, industrial chemicals and food additives. They are useful for researchers who design and analyze interaction studies, for risk assessors who use interaction data in risk assessments, and for those who make risk management decisions pertaining to pesticides. This paper describes our methodology for assessing data on the combined activity of pesticides and then discusses how to interpret such data in the context of an ecological risk assessment. Examples have been drawn primarily from studies with herbicides and nontarget plants, and several example analyses have been included that can inform whether mixture data are sufficiently reliable and relevant for use in regulatory decision making.

Nano-encapsulation of herbicides used in agriculture is one of the strategies to reduce the impact of such widely used agrochemicals. Nano-encapsulated herbicides are controlled membrane systems in which the active ingredient is coated with semi-permeable membranes, which may be organic or inorganic polymers. In our study, chloridazon herbicide was selected as the active ingredient to be nano-encapsulated. The ionic gelation method was used to synthesize nanocapsules consisting of alginate and chitosan for chloridazon encapsulation. Alginate-chitosan nanoparticles were prepared in a two-step process involving the ionotropic pre-gelation of an alginate core and then the formation of a chitosan polyelectrolyte complex. The alginate-chitosan nanocapsules containing chloridazon were synthesized at a size of 253 nm with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.266 and a zeta potential of-1.43 mV. The loading capacity and entrapment efficiency of these nanocapsules were 14% and 57%, respectively. The monitoring of chloridazon release from formulated alginate-chitosan nanocapsules was performed using dialysis tube testing and UV spectroscopy. The results indicated the slow release of chloridazon from loaded alginate-chitosan nanocapsules. controlled release and increasing the duration of action of chloridazon, along with reducing the required dose, is promising in reducing the adverse effects of chloridazon. Overall, the synthesized alginate-chitosan nanocapsules, as nanocarriers, have effective properties such as controlled release, prolonged action time, and reduced dose, which are expected to reduce the adverse effects of chloridazon on health and the environment, and improve precision agriculture.Copyright: (c) 2022 by the C.M.B.

Partitioning,ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,"Recent research has confirmed the significance of organic carbon (OC) as the key sorbent for hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOC), as well as for many polar compounds. However, the triazine herbicides exhibit a variable affinity for soil organic matter (SOM) which is attributed to the extent of humification of the organic fraction. Charge transfer mechanisms are important for triazine sorption to OC and either proton or electron transfer may account for the reaction mechanism with humic acids. For many uron herbicides (e.g, chlorotoluron, metabromuron chloroxuron, defenoxuron), sorption correlates with SOM. However, specific interactions between uron herbicides and a limited quantity of active constituents within SOM have also been proposed to explain deviations from sorption linearity at low herbicide relative concentration. Other studies indicate that isoproturon sorbs to organic colloids in solution and that a sorption threshold to SOM may be operative. Below the threshold, isoproturon appears to sorb predominantly to clays, indicating the presence of a limited number of 'active' sorptive sites within clay minerals. Research suggests that pesticide interactions with clay minerals may be influenced by near-surface day geometry; the accessibility of the sorbing region of the sorbate to the active site of the clay; the identity of exchangeable cations on the clay and solution electrolytes. These recent studies indicate that interactions between micropollutants and soils and sediments often need to be evaluated on a compound-specific basis. This is especially the case for polar compounds which may partition to these environmental phases by diverse mechanisms.",2000,21,845,863,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593332108618060

At an equivalent dosage of imazamethabenz the liquid concentrate (LC) formulation had higher herbicidal activity and much lower pH than did the suspension concentrate (SC) formulation.

NaB did not improve the activity of the LC formulation. Increasing the spray solution pH from 5.6 to approximately 7.3 with 1 M KOH antagonized phytotoxicity of both LC and SC formulations of imazamethabenz alone, and imazamethabenz-SC plus NaB. Citric acid phosphate buffers at pH 3 6, or HCl-KCl buffers at pH 1 and 2, either had no effect or antagonized the activity of the SC formulation of imazamethabenz.

NaB provided both bisulphate ion and low pH concurrently. Acidic buffers did not improve the activity of the SC formulation except in the presence of bisulphate or sulphate ions.

The results were parameterized and transferred to analyze the effect of formulation types on the outdoor experimental data via inverse analyses of two structurally-compatible mathematical models, namely: pesticide concentration in paddy field for laboratory (PCPF-LR) and PCPF for outdoors (PCPF-1R(v1.1)). Results After in-laboratory calibration, the PCPF-LR model revealed statistically acceptable or ideal simulations of pesticide concentrations in both the aqueous and soil phases (e.g. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.7), in addition to determining the apparent sorption from the laboratory data. The extracted persistence indicators (degradation half-life, DegT(50)) in the aqueous phase were 1.4-38.7 times higher than those of the dissipation (DT50) due to the exclusion of partitioning and phase transfer processes (diffusion and sorption). In the outdoor experiment, 72% of the outdoor-calibrated simulations of the PCPF-1R(v1.1) model, showed statistically acceptable representations of the concentrations in paddy water. Furthermore, the DegT(50) as 'bulk' degradation in paddy water was statistically insignificant between the formulation types; however, the DT50 demonstrated statistically different results.

Dichloroacetamide safeners, namely benoxacor and furilazole, are commonly used in formulations containing chloroacetamide herbicides. Extensive reports on adsorption of chloroacetamide herbicides are available, yet little information exists regarding adsorption potential of co-applied safeners. Herein, the adsorption and desorption characteristics of selected herbicide safeners to granular activated carbon (GAC) and in agricultural soils are reported. Further, soil column studies were performed to understand the leaching behaviour of the herbicide Dual II Magnum. Equilibrium sorption experiments of safeners to three agricultural soils and one GAC showed that adsorption was best fitted by the Freundlich isotherm. The Freundlich adsorption constant, Kf, for benoxacor and furilazole sorption onto three agricultural soils ranged from 0.1 to 0.27 and 0.1 to 0.13 (mg/g) x (mg/L)(boolean AND)(1/n), respectively. The K-f for benoxacor and furilazole to GAC was 6.4 and 3.4 (mg/g) x (mg/L)(boolean AND)(1/n), respectively, suggesting more favorable sorption of benoxacor to GAC than furilazole to GAC. The sorption to soils was reversible as almost 40%-90% of both safeners was desorbed from three soils. These results were validated in four replicated soil column studies, where S-metolachlor was shown to leach similarly to the safener benoxacor, originating from the herbicide formulation. The leaching of S-metolachlor and benoxacor was influenced by soil texture. Cumulatively, these results show that safeners will move through the environment to surface waters similarly to the active ingredients in herbicides, but may be removed during drinking water treatment via GAC.

2006,Cecylia,not vetted,"Achmadi, UF; Pauluhn, J",Household insecticides: evaluation and assessment of inhalation toxicity: a workshop summary,EXPERIMENTAL AND TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY,"Particularly in tropical countries household insecticides are used on a day-by-day basis to control mosquitoes, other crawling and flying insects to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases. The products used most often are spray-cans, oil-sprays, mosquito coils as well as slow-release vaporising systems such as mars and liquid vaporiser. The extent and duration of exposure of humans is highly dependent on the type of product used. The objective of this workshop was to analyse the necessity and feasibility of inhalation studies with household insecticides taking into account the specific constrains associated with each type of end-use product. The standardisation of inhalation studies with regard to the generation of test atmospheres, mode and duration of exposure, and selection of adequate toxicological endpoints were addressed. Due to the complex nature of exposure atmospheres generated by some household insecticides, viz. mosquito coils, it is scientifically challenging to characterise the pathomechanism of most concern, since irritant combustion gases, volatile and semi-volatile organic substances, particulates (soot), condensation aerosols and re-condensed substances onto particulates may act independently, synergistically or mixture specific. It has been concluded that for the comparative safety evaluation and risk assessment of indoor insecticide end-use products generally recognised guidance for harmonised inhalation testing is required: 1) For high-dose release products, such as spray-cans, acute inhalation testing appears to be most relevant. 2) For low-dose, slow-release devices, subchronic inhalation studies of 13-weeks, duration of exposure 6 hours/day for 5 consecutive days per week, should be performed on rats preferably with the end-use product. A dose-range finding study of 2-weeks duration, daily exposure, should be available for the justification of dose selection and to demonstrate that the findings of 5 days/week exposure is not different from that utilising a daily exposure. 3) In certain instances, inhalation testing of shorter duration, for example 2 or 4 weeks, may be appropriate if the inhalation toxicity of the basic formula has already been characterised or the major constituents contained in the formulation have been examined in extant studies. The duration of study should also depend on actual use and exposure pattern, the accumulation potential and the mode of action of the ingredients of concern. 4) Particularly for mosquito coil smokes, the possible physico-chemical interactions of particulates, potentially irritant water soluble or nonsoluble vapours and aerosol or vapours of the active ingredient(s) are virtually impossible to predict without appropriate inhalation testing. 5) Physiological measurements may be useful for the detection and quantification of the respiratory tract sensory irritation potency. Biochemical endpoints in lung lavage and conventional histopathology of the lungs and extrathoracic airways are considered to be important. 6) It has been agreed that the nose-only exposure technique provides the most cost-effective and controlled means to expose small laboratory animals to well defined atmospheres as long as the limitations of this technique are taken into account.",1998,50,67,72,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0940-2993(98)80073-0

Common waterhemp has become a key weed in midwestern crop production systems and is a good target for a bioherbicide that could be integrated into weed management systems. We investigated the direct effects of a range of chemical herbicides and adjuvants upon conidia of M. amaranthi and found that many herbicides and most adjuvants were strongly inhibitory to germination. On the other hand, M. amaranthi was compatible with a selection of post-emergence herbicides commonly used in midwestern weed management systems, including carfentrazone, chloransulam, and imazethapyr. Most glyphosate products suppressed or abolished germination of M. amaranthi conidia, but by testing adjuvants commonly used in glyphosate products and technical-grade glyphosate salts, it was revealed that this inhibition was due to formulation additives and not the active ingredient. When glyphosate and conidia of M. amaranthi were sprayed onto common waterhemp seedlings, the herbicide predisposed plants to infection by M amaranthi. When M. amaranthi was applied 1 to 3 d after glyphosate, the glyphosate rate required to control common waterhemp was reduced by half Similar results were observed on clones propagated from a common waterhemp plant resistant to glyphosate. When M. amaranthi was applied to seedlings 2 d before glyphosate, the efficacy of the herbicide was reduced. These findings demonstrate that positive interactions between herbicides and M. amaranthi exist but reveal practical difficulties that may limit the integration of the strategy in the field.",2006,54,532,537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-05-102R1.1

Insect mortality was determined after 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure, while 65 d later progeny production was evaluated. In the case of T. confusum larvae, adult emergence was estimated 4 weeks after the initiation of the bioassays. Among the species examined, S. granarius and S. oryzae were the most susceptible to spinetoram in terms of parental mortality, however progeny production was significantly suppressed only in the case of S. granarius. In contrast, O. surinamensis, T confusum and T. castaneum were the least susceptible to the specific dose rates of spinetoram tested. Thiamethoxam was effective against all species tested providing high levels of parental mortality and progeny production suppression. However, the combined application of thiamethoxam and spinetoram at the specific dose rates tested did not exhibit any additive or synergistic effect against the stored-product beetle species examined. Still, the combined application of these active ingredients did not exhibit any antagonistic effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To show pesticide transfer across the amphibian dermis at permitted label application rates, our study was designed to measure pesticide body burdens after two simulated exposure scenarios. We compared direct exposures, where amphibians were present when spraying occurred, to indirect exposures, where amphibians were exposed to soils after pesticide application. During summer 2012, we reared barking (Hyla gratiosa) and green treefrogs (H. cinerea) through 60-90 days post-metamorphosis at a United States Environmental Protection Agency research laboratory. We tested exposure for 8 h to five pesticide active ingredients (imidacloprid, atrazine, triadimefon, fipronil, or pendimethalin) in glass aquaria lined with soil in the laboratory. We quantified total pesticide body burden and soil concentrations using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Herein, a commercial Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide formulation (NPF), the active ingredient of NPF (AI-NPF), the prepared Cu(OH)(2) nanotubes (NT) with comparable morphology and size to AI-NPF, and CuSO4 were respectively applied to soil at normal doses (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg), followed by an application of neonicotinoid thiacloprid after an interval of 21 d, showing that NPF at doses of 5 and 50 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) mitigated thiacloprid degradation compared to control and CuSO4. Furthermore, AI-NPF was the primary component that contributed to the mitigation effect of NPF, which was also validated by the NT. Large differences in the degradation efficiency of thiacloprid in sterilized and unsterilized soils with Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticides suggested that biodegradation was the primary process responsible for thiacloprid degradation, especially as chemical degradation was negligible. Besides a decrease of thiacloprid bioavailability due to adsorption by Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticides, we demonstrated that Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticides changed soil microbial communities, reduced nitrile hydratase activity and down-regulated thiacloprid-degradative nth gene abundance, which thus mitigated thiacloprid biodegradation.

LT50 values for uncontaminated gel bait deposits ranged from 0.4 d for PreEmpt containing imidacloprid to 4.1 d for Maxforce containing hydramethvlnon. As a group, significantly more gel bait was consumed thmi solid formulations even when both formulations had similar concentrations of the same active ingredient. As a result, gel baits were significantly more toxic than solid formulations. Application of mint oil directly to bait deposits significantly decreased bait consumption and increased overall LT50 values. When bait formulation types were examined individually, there was no difference in consumption or toxicity between contaminated and uncontaminated gel formulations. Contaminated solid baits. however, had significantly greater LT50 values and less consumption than uncontaminated solid baits. Gel formulations probably absorbed the contaminants and removed them from the surface of the bait deposits resulting in normal bait consumption and toxicity. Gel and solid bait deposits, inside plastic exposure stations or alone with no station and placed onto mint oil-contaminated Substrates. had significantly lower bait consumption and greater LT50 values than baits placed on uncontaminated substrates.

The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of the distribution and efficacy of four different spot-on formulations with permethrin as the active ingredient formulated with different solvents. To examine the influence of these solvents on the speed of distribution and the acaricidal activity of permethrin in the coat, an in vivo study under laboratory conditions was performed. Six dogs per test period were treated with the recommended dose and 1, 14 and 28 days after treatment dogs were infested with Dermacentor reticulatus ticks: a) on the back, near the application site, and b) on the hind leg, the greatest possible distance from the application site. Efficacies were determined 6 hours after tick infestation to examine the repellent effect and the speed of kill of the products which plays an important role in the context of tick transmitted diseases. Results: After six hours of exposure, a significant acaricidal efficacy (p < 0.001) could be observed in all treated groups over the whole duration of the study, regardless of which product was used. While the arithmetic mean of attached ticks was < 3 on Day 1, numbers increased over the course of the study to a mean of > 9 on Day 28. However, most of these ticks were dead even 28 days after treatment, as the mean of live attached ticks was still < 2. Significant differences could neither be found between the different permethrin spot-on formulations, nor between the two parts of the body (p > 0.05). Conclusions: All products were able to kill ticks within six hours following infestation from Day 1 to Day 28 after treatment. Additionally, no significant difference between the tick numbers on the back and the hind leg could be found at any time, which implies a homogenous distribution of permethrin over the body.

Imidacloprid (IM) and hexaflumuron (HFM) are extensively utilized insect poisons for crop assurance on the planet. A few investigations examined IM harmfulness in rodents, but its exact mechanism hasn't been mentioned previously as well as the toxicity of HFM doesn't elucidate yet. For this reason, the present study was designed to explore the mechanism of each IM and HFM-evoked rat liver and kidney toxicity and to understand its molecular mechanism. 21 male Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups, as follows: group (1), normal saline; group (2), IM; and group (3), HFM. Both insecticides were orally administered every day for 28 days at a dose equal to 1/10 LD50 from the active ingredient. After 28 days postdosing, rats were anesthetized to collect blood samples then euthanized to collect liver and kidney tissue specimens. The results showed marked changes in walking, body tension, alertness, and head movement with a significant reduction in rats' body weight in both IM and HFM receiving groups. Significant increases in MDA levels and decrease of GHS levels were recorded in liver and kidney homogenates of either IM or HFM groups. Liver and kidney tissues obtained from both pesticide receiving groups showed extensive histopathological alterations with a significant increase in the serum levels of ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine and a decrease in total proteins, albumin, and globulin levels. In addition, there was upregulation of the transcript levels of casp-3, JNK, and HO-1 genes with strong immunopositivity of casp-3, TNF-alpha, and NF-B-K protein expressions in the liver and kidneys of rats receiving either IM or HFM compared with the control group. In all studied parameters, HFM caused hepatorenal toxicity more than those induced by IM. We can conclude that each IM and HFM provoked liver and kidneys damage through overproduction of ROS, activation of NF-B-K signaling pathways and mitochondrial/JNK-dependent apoptosis pathway.",2022,29,29091,29104,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18486-z

Renowned for their high tolerance of ionic strength, alkylpolyglycosides are the only class of nonionics that will provide wetting, interfacial tension reduction, and emulsification properties to these systems absent the presence of other classes of surfactants or hydrotroping agents. This property makes them especially valuable when considering how to couple together today's multicomponent pesticide products with disparate properties as where one component is water-soluble and others are oil soluble. The utility is further heightened when it is remembered that both water soluble and oil soluble active ingredients can have their efficacy potentiated by nonionic surfactants. Complex combinations of adjuvant chemistry have also recently entered the marketplace which require tolerance of high ionic strength. Foam is a property exhibited by most nonionic surfactants, alkylpolyglycosides included. A limited number of agricultural applications benefit from foam but for most formulators using these products the challenge is to control the foam whatever source it comes from. A number of chemical approaches have been investigated and those persons familiar with the chemistry of nonionic surfactants will recognize the similarity to strategies employed with traditional nonionics based on alcohol or alkylarylphenol ethoxylates. The alkypolyglycoside can be based on a low molecular weight fatty alcohol, the degree of polymerization can be extended or truncated and the hydroxyl groups can be functionalized. None of these modifications are without impact on the same properties that attracted us to these surfactants initially and the impact is not always positive. The focus of the present work is not on structural modification. It is to compare the effectiveness of a range of coformulants and foam control agents available to the agricultural formulator working with alkylpolyglycoside surfactants. Foam control agents based on fluorochemistry, silicone chemistry, hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols and polymeric defoaming surfactant are compared with each other in the alkylpolyglycoside environment.

Its aquatic ecosystems may be considered vulnerable to pollution due to recent changes in land use toward agriculture. In 2011 and 2012, quarterly sampling was done at ten sites located in the middle and lower sections of the Frio River Basin that pass through crop areas and later drain into Cano Negro wetland. Pesticide residues, nitrates, sediment concentrations, and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish biomarkers were studied in the selected sites. Additionally, risk of toxicity was calculated in two different ways: (1) by using a ratio of MEC to hazard concentrations threshold for 5% of species (HC5) to calculate a risk quotient (RQ), and (2) by using a ratio of MEC to available ecotoxicity data of native fish and cladocera for diazinon and ethoprophos, to obtain a risk quotient for native species (RQns). Results indicated that three out of the ten sites (rivers Thiales, Monico, and Sabogal) showed variable levels of pollution including six different active ingredients (a.i.) of pesticide formulations (herbicides ametryn, bromacil, and diuron: insecticides cypermethrin, diazinon, and ethoprophos). Moreover, potential adverse effects on fishes in Thiales and Monico rivers were indicated by cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enhancement. Risk evaluations indicated pesticide residues of ametryn, bromacil, and ethoprophos to be exceeding the limits set by MTR, also RQ was high (>1) in 70% of the positive samples for diuron (most frequently found pesticide in water samples), cypermethrin, diazinon, and ethoprophos, and RQns was high for diazinon. Therefore, these substances might be of major concern for the ecological health of aquatic ecosystems in the middle basin of the Frio River. The most critical site was Monico River, which had the highest pollution (75% detection samples with 3-5 a.i.) and highest calculated risk (RQ > 1 in 75% of the samples). This is also the river that most directly drains into the protected wetland.

A new fumigant, dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) could be an alternative for French growers with respect to the phase-out of methyl bromide (MeBr) for soil disinfestion. The more the availability of other fumigants is very limited: chloropicrin is not registered in France, nor the application of fumigants via drip irrigation systems. After preliminary laboratory experiments, in which are shown very promising results on several soil borne fungi, field experiments were carried out between 2002 and 2004 in French practical conditions. Objectives were: (i) to confirm fungicidal spectrum of DMDS, (ii) to understand the gas behaviour of this fumigant into the soil profile and to calculate in situ lethal Concentration Time Products (CTPs), (iii) to evaluate new methods of applications and especially via the existing drip irrigation, using several amounts of water. Experiments were carried out on micro-plots with artificial inoculation with soil borne pathogens and on natural infested soils. Pure DMDS was applied by shank injection and a 95 EC formulation by drip irrigation with two rates of water, 6 and 12 L/m(2). Rates of active ingredients were 0.03, 0.06 and 0.08 kg/m(2). All plots were covered with a Virtually Impermeable Film (VIF) during one week. Calibrated Thermal Conductivity Cells (Fumiscope or Gow-Mac) were used for the monitoring of gas concentrations and to calculate CTPs. A 100% control was achieved for the fungi Rhizoctonia solani and Verticillium dahliae at a rate of 0.08 kg/m(2); for Sclerotium rolfsii only 85% mortality, as compared to MeBr, was achieved. DMDS gas behaviour studies confirm a quick diffusion into the soil profile, especially by injection. An average CTP between 3821 g.h/m(3) and 7783 g.h/m(3) at 15 cm and 30 cm soil depths was obtained in all plots. Using drip irrigation, CTP seems higher at 15 cm depth but lower at 30 cm, and there is no significant statistical difference between the application with 6 and 12 Lm/(2) of water.

The results indicate that for pure surfactant solution, only when the concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration, sufficient surfactant molecules are adsorbed on the oil-water interface to form a high-strength interface film, so as to prevent droplet coalescence and improve the emulsion stability. However, for pesticide solution, the active ingredient with a certain surface activity will reduce the interfacial tension of the solution.

Nevertheless, knowledge about physical stability of Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide in soil solutions is currently scarce, restricting comprehensive understanding of the fate and risk of Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide in the soil environment. Herein we investigated aggregation, sedimentation and dissolution of Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide in soil solutions extracted from three different soil samples, wherein commercial Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide formulation (NPF), as well as its active ingredient (AI) and laboratory-prepared Cu(OH)(2) nanorods (NR) with similar morphology as AI, were used as model Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticides. We found that NPF compared to AI showed less extents of aggregation in ultrapure water due to the presence of dispersing agent in NPF. Yet, moderated aggregation and sedimentation were observed for Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide irrespective of NPF, AI or NR when soil solutions were used instead of ultrapure water. The sedimentation rate constants of AI and NPF were 0.023 min(-1) and 0.010 min(-1) in the ultrapure water, whereas the rate constants of 0.003-0.021 min(-1) and 0.002-0.007 min(-1) were observed for AI and NPF in soil solutions, respectively. Besides aggregation and sedimentation, dissolution of Cu(OH)(2) nanopesticide in soil solutions was highly dependent on soil type, wherein pH and organic matter played important roles in dissolution. Although the final concentrations of dissolved copper (1.08-1.37 mg/L) were comparable among different soil solutions incubating 48 mg/L of AI, NPF or NR for 96 h, a gradual increase followed by an equilibrium was only observed in the soil solution from acidic soil (pH 5.16) with the low content of organic matter (1.20 g/kg).

Field-scale pesticide volatilization involves the interaction of a number of complex variables. There is a need to acquire pesticide volatilization fluxes from a location where several of these variables can be held constant. Accordingly, soil properties, tillage practices, surface residue management, and pesticide formulations were held constant while fundamental information regarding metolachlor volatilization (a pre-emergent pesticide) was monitored over a five-year period as influenced by meteorological variables and soil water content. Metolachlor vapor concentrations were measured continuously for 120 h after each application using polyurethane foam plugs in a logarithmic profile above the soil surface. A flux gradient technique was used to compute volatilization fluxes from metolachlor concentration profiles and turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor (as determined from eddy covariance measurements). Differences in meteorological conditions and surface soil water contents resulted in variability of the volatilization losses over the years studied. The peak volatilization losses for each year occurred during the first 24 h after application with a maximum flux rate in 2001 (1500 ng m(-2) s(-1)) associated with wet surface soil conditions combined with warm temperatures. The cumulative volatilization losses for the 120-hour period following metolachlor application varied over the years from 5 to 25% of the applied active ingredient, with approximately 87% of the losses occurring during the first 72 h. In all of the years studied, volatilization occurred diurnally and accounted for between 43 and 86% during the day and 14 and 57% during the night of the total measured loss.

Concurrently with its drastic increase in usage, concern over indirect ecosystem effects and effects on non-target species has grown. In restoration, glyphosate is often used to remove invasive plants so native plants may be re-introduced. However, successful reintroductions require soils and microbial communities that support native plant growth, and it is critical that glyphosate applications do not harm soil microbes such as mycorrhizal fungi. Despite previous studies investigating the effects of glyphosate on soils and microbial communities, comprehensive field experi-ments combining soil chemistry and next generation sequencing technologies to describe both bacterial and eukaryotic responses to glyphosate are limited, especially in the contexts of ecosystem restoration and soil health. We studied the effects of the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup Promax at frequencies of 0, 2, 4, and 5 applications over the course of 12 months on soil biotic and abiotic soil health indicators in a Colorado prairie dominated by the invasive cool-season grass Bromus inermis.

Bacterial and archaeal communities were more affected by Roundup Promax than eukaryotic communities, with decreases in phylogenetic diversity and changes in community structure following Roundup Promax applica-tions, particularly after five applications. More critically, the colonization of plant roots by arbuscular mycor-rhizal fungi decreased significantly in plots receiving even just two applications of Roundup Promax, and dark septate endophytes decreased after four applications. Our work shows that Roundup Promax had multiple negative effects on soil biota in this field study due to either direct effects or indirect effects mediated through plant removal.

The primary role of sanitizers during cantaloupe washing is to prevent cross contamination of potentially pathogenic bacteria in washwater. Postharvest fungicide sprays or dips are employed to inhibit spoilage-causing fungi. While assessing the compatibility of these antimicrobials based on the measurement of active ingredients levels provides some indication of antimicrobial capacity, there is limited data on whether the interaction between these chemicals in wash water modifies their overall efficacy against relevant microorganisms. The aim of this research was to determine how chlorine- and peroxyacetic acid-based sanitizers interact with commercial guazatine- and imazalil-based fungicide formulations used on cantaloupes, and whether mixing these augments or suppresses anti-microbial activity against relevant human pathogens and spoilage fungi in wash water. The results were unpredictable: while most combinations were antimicrobial, the chlorine-based sanitizer when mixed with the guazatine-based fungicide had significantly reduced efficacy against pathogenic Salmonella spp. (similar to 2.7 log) and the fungal spoilage organisms, Trichothecium roseum and Rhizopus stolonifera. Mixing the chlorine-based sanitizer with an imazalil-based fungicide produced a range of outcomes with antagonistic, indifferent and synergistic interactions observed for the fungal species tested. The peroxyacetic acid-based sanitizer led to indifferent interactions with the guazatine-based fungicide, while antagonism and synergy were observed when mixed with the imazalilbased fungicide.

The proportions of tawny mole cricket (Scapteriscus vicious Scudder) and southern mole cricket (Scapteriscus borellii Giglio-Tos) were 87% and 13% in 2008 and 78% and 22% in 2009, respectively. Plots treated with insecticides had lower ratings of tunneling damage than the untreated plots, which had the most severe damage in October of 2008 and 2009. Fipronil was the most effective insecticide, which reduced tunneling activity from 4.0 +/- 0.9 to 0.8 +/- 0.3 and 5.3 +/- 0.3 to 1.1 +/- 0.1 within two weeks after treatment (WAT) in 2008 and 2009, respectively, and maintained effective residual control until December. Neonicotinoids (all active ingredients and formulations), acephate, and bifenthrin did not perform as well as fipronil, but contributed to lowering the damage in the treated plots. The long-term efficacy was not significantly different among products containing clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam. The combination of clothianidin and bifenthrin (Aloft (TM)) and imidacloprid and bifenthrin (Allectus (R)) improved the suppression of tunneling activity only in the first two WAT when compared to products containing only clothianidin (Arena (TM)) or imidacloprid (Merit (R)). The efficacy of Aloft and Allectus against mole crickets was not different between broadcast and granular formulations on most sampling dates. This study demonstrated that products containing fipronil provided turf managers with long-term suppression of mole cricket tunneling damage, while products containing acephate, bifenthrin, and neonicotinoids would only provide suppression for 20 weeks.",2009,26,135,146,http://dx.doi.org/10.3954/1523-5475-26.3.135

Some ACCase resistant grass species are also controlled. Low doses of 15 g a.i./ha provide a highly flexible herbicidal potential for early- to mid post-emergence applications. Selective use is only possible through the addition of the safener mefenpyr-diethyl which reduces crop injury without compromising herbicidal efficacy on grass and broad-leaved weeds. Mesosulfuronmethyl is an inhibitor of acetolactate synthase (ALS). Mefenpyr-diethyl enhances the metabolism/detoxification of the herbicide selectively in cereal crop plants but not in weeds. Both molecules have favourable toxicological and environmental profiles with low risk potentials. Rapid soil degradation and limited bio-availability indicate no carry-over risks when used under normal agricultural and environmental conditions. Mesosulfuron-methyl plus mefenpyr-diethyl has an excellent fit for integrated grass weed management in cereals because of its wide spectrum and the control of some ACCase resistant species.",2002,NA,661,668,NA

One approach to meeting this need has been the development of new products for indoor residual spraying (IRS) with novel active ingredients for public health. While initial results showing the impact of several of these next-generation IRS products have been encouraging, questions remain about how to best deploy them for maximum impact. To help address these questions, a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled trial to measure the impact of IRS with a microencapsulated formulation of pirimiphos-methyl (PM) in an area with high ownership of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was conducted in a high-transmission district of central Mozambique with pyrethroid resistant vectors. Presented here are the results of the vector surveillance component of the trial.MethodsThe 2 year, two-armed trial was conducted in Mopeia District, Zambezia Province, Mozambique. In ten sentinel villages, five that received IRS with PM in October-November 2016 and again in October-November 2017 and five that received no IRS, indoor light trap collections and paired indoor-outdoor human landing collections catches (HLCs) were conducted monthly from September 2016 through October 2018. A universal coverage campaign in June 2017, just prior to the second spray round, distributed 131,540 standard alpha-cypermethrin LLINs across all study villages and increased overall net usage rates in children under 5 years old to over 90%.ResultsThe primary malaria vector during the trial was Anopheles funestus sensu lato (s.l.), and standard World Health Organization (WHO) tube tests with this population indicated variable but increasing resistance to pyrethroids (including alpha-cypermethrin, from>85% mortality in 2017 to 7% mortality in 2018) and uniform susceptibility to PM (100% mortality in both years). Over the entire duration of the study, IRS reduced An. funestus s.l. densities by 48% (CI95 33-59%; p<0.001) in indoor light traps and by 74% (CI95 38-90%; p=0.010) during indoor and outdoor HLC, though in each study year reductions in vector density were consistently greatest in those months immediately following the IRS campaigns and waned over time. Overall there was no strong preference for An. funestus to feed indoors or outdoors, and these biting behaviours did not differ significantly across study arms: observed indoor-outdoor biting ratios were 1.10 (CI95 1.00-1.21) in no-IRS villages and 0.88 (CI95 0.67-1.15) in IRS villages. The impact of IRS was consistent in reducing HLC exposures both indoors (75% reduction: CI95 47-88%; p=0.<0.001) and outdoors (68% reduction: CI95 22-87%; p=0.012). While substantially fewer Anopheles gambiae s.l. were collected during the study, trends show a similar impact of IRS on this key vector group as well, with a 33% (CI95 7-53%; p=0.019) reduction in mosquitoes collected in light traps and a non-statistically significant 39% reduction (p=0.249) in HLC landing rates.ConclusionIRS with PM used in addition to pyrethroid-only LLINs substantially reduced human exposures to malaria vectors during both years of the cluster-randomized controlled trial in Mopeia-a high-burden district where the primary vector, An. funestus s.l., was equally likely to feed indoors or outdoors and demonstrated increasing resistance to pyrethroids. Findings suggest that IRS with PM can provide effective vector control, including in some settings where pyrethroid-only ITNs are widely used.Trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov, NCT02910934.

However, application of several established deworming agents can harm treated hosts and environment due to their low specificity. Furthermore, the number of parasite strains showing resistance is growing, while hardly any new anthelminthics are being developed. Here, we present a bioinformatics workflow designed to reduce the time and cost in the development of new strategies against parasites. The workflow includes quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics, 3D structure modeling, binding site prediction, and virtual ligand screening. Its use is demonstrated for Acanthocephala (thorny-headed worms) which are an emerging pest in fish aquaculture. We included three acanthocephalans (Pomphorhynchus laevis, Neoechinorhynchus agilis, Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae) from four fish species (common barbel, European eel, thinlip mullet, tambaqui). Results: The workflow led to eleven highly specific candidate targets in acanthocephalans. The candidate targets showed constant and elevated transcript abundances across definitive and accidental hosts, suggestive of constitutive expression and functional importance. Hence, the impairment of the corresponding proteins should enable specific and effective killing of acanthocephalans. Candidate targets were also highly abundant in the acanthocephalan body wall, through which these gutless parasites take up nutrients. Thus, the candidate targets are likely to be accessible to compounds that are orally administered to fish. Virtual ligand screening led to ten compounds, of which five appeared to be especially promising according to ADMET, GHS, and RO5 criteria: tadalafil, pranazepide, piketoprofen, heliomycin, and the nematicide derquantel. Conclusions: The combination of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics led to a broadly applicable procedure for the cost- and time-saving identification of candidate target proteins in parasites. The ligands predicted to bind can now be further evaluated for their suitability in the control of acanthocephalans.

Cypermethrin and emamectin benzoate are the active ingredients in Excis and Slice respectively, which are widely used to control ectoparasitic sea lice on farmed salmon. Excis and Slice treatments did not cause basin-wide effects on the zooplankton community. For both formulations, no adverse affects on zooplankton were detected, instead observed changes in zooplankton abundance and community composition displayed natural seasonal cycles of abundance. Water column concentrations of cypermethrin and emarnectin benzoate following sea lice treatments at the fish farm were predicted using models. Cypermethrin concentrations of 3000 ng/l were predicted for short periods immediately after each cage treatment assuming no particle adhesion. The 3-h and 24-h Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) were exceeded for 10 h and 32 h respectively on the second day when five cages were treated. However, cypermethrin concentrations higher than 0.5 ng/l (24-h EQS) were predicted to occur over < 2% of the total basin area on each treatment day. The 3-h EQS (16 ng/l) was exceeded in < 0.3% of the basin on each treatment day. The concentration of soluble emarnectin benzoate present in the water column was predicted from modelled deposition footprints and sediment concentrations to be of order 10(-3) ng/l. Predicted concentrations of both chemicals were generally lower than those causing toxicity to copepods in previous laboratory studies and further support the results of this field study that environmental concentrations of Excis and Slice do not adversely impact zooplankton communities.

The foliar activity of imazamethabenz-methyl was reduced when applied in mixture with salt formulations of MCPA and mecoprop, salt and ester formulations of bromoxynil and bentazone. In contrast, chlorsulfuron had no influence and ester formulations of MCPA and mecoprop either had no effect or promoted imazamethabenz-methyl performance. A comparison of the activity of imazamethabenz-methyl in mixture with the ester formulation of MCPA and the corresponding formulation blank revealed that the antagonistic effect of MCPA active ingredient in the salt and ester formulations were similar. However, because of an enhancing effect of the formulation constituents in the ester formulation antagonism was masked in mixture with the latter. Similarly, addition of a mineral oil adjuvant only masked but did not eliminate the antagonistic interaction between the two herbicides. Volume rate did not affect imazamethabenz-methyl activity nor the antagonistic effect of the salt formulation of MCPA. The ester formulation of MCPA, however, promoted imazamethabenz-methyl performance significantly more at the low than at the high volume rate. Sequential application reduced antagonism of the salt formulation of MCPA on imazamethabenz-methyl. Selective placement of droplets revealed that antagonism occurred only if imazamethabenz-methyl and the salt formulation of MCPA were applied in the same droplet but not as separate droplets. Neither foliar- nor root-applied MCPA reduced the performance of root-applied imazamethabenz-methyl. The results indicate that antagonism of MCPA was caused by a reduced uptake. The implications of the results of the present study in relation to the performance of tank mixtures of imazamethabenz-methyl and broadleaf herbicides under field conditions are discussed.",1994,34,251,263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1994.tb01993.x

The addition of S-metolachlor products to dicamba spray solutions generally decreases spray droplet size and increases spray drift potential. Advances in formulation technology fostered the development of products with reduced spray drift potential, especially for herbicide premixes containing multiple active ingredients. The objective of this study was to compare the drift potential of a novel dicamba plus S-metolachlor premix formulation (capsule suspension) against a tankmix containing dicamba (soluble liquid) and S-metolachlor (emulsifiable concentrate) using different venturi nozzles. RESULTS The MUG nozzle had greater D-V0.5 (1128.6 mu m) compared to the ULDM (930.3 mu m), TDXL-D (872.9 mu m), and TTI nozzles (854.8 mu m). The premix formulation had greater D-V0.5 (971.0 mu m) compared to the tankmix (922.3 mu m). Nozzle influenced spray drift deposition (P < 0.0001) and soybean biomass reduction (P = 0.0465). Herbicide formulation influenced spray drift deposition (P < 0.0001), and biomass reduction of soybean (P < 0.0001) and cotton (P = 0.0479). The novel capsule suspension formulation (premix) of dicamba plus S-metolachlor had reduced area under the drift curve (AUDC) (577.6) compared to the tankmix (913.7). Applications using the MUG nozzle reduced AUDC (459.9) compared to the other venturi nozzles (ranging from 677.4 to 1141.7).

This study assessed DBU formation upon (1) application of n-butyl-1-[C-14]butylisocyanate (BIC), the immediate precursor to DBU formation, in four soils at two water potentials (0.03 and 0.1 MPa) and (2) application of benomyl butyl-1-C-14-benomyl enriched Benlate DF and SP fungicides to two soils at various combinations of negative water potential (0.03 or 0.1 MPa) and temperature (23 or 33 degreesC). Parent compounds, metabolites, and (CO2)-C-14 were tracked using chromatographic analysis with radioassay and UV detection, liquid scintillation counting, and postextraction oxidation of the soil. At 0.03 MPa in all four BIC-treated soils, DBU formation was never detected. At 0.1 MPa, DBU was detected in two soils, but at concentrations <3.6 mug kg(-1) (0.3 wt % of applied BIC). In both soils treated with benomyl formulations, DBU formation was observed with only Benlate 50 DF application at 0.03 MPa and 23 degreesC, which was followed by rapid dissipation of DBU. The maximum concentration observed was 0.41 mug g(-1) (0.65 wt % of applied benomyl at 62.8 mug g(-1)), which is well below levels currently reported to cause adverse effects to plants. Combined benomyl and carbendazim half-lives in soils across treatments were 2-3 months.

Efficacy was assessed on wheat and maize at three dosages of spinosad dust formulation (corresponding to 0.0625, 0.1875 and 0.625 ppm of active ingredient [Al] for S. oryzae and to 0.1875, 0.625 and 1.25 ppm of Al for T confusum), alone or combined with SilicoSec at 150 ppm for S. oryzae and 250 ppm for T confusum. The mortality of S. oryzae exposed for 14 d on wheat treated with spinosad ranged between 83% and 100%. Conversely, the mortality of S. oryzae on maize treated with DE or on maize treated with lower doses of spinosad dust did not exceed 19% and was only 59% on maize with the highest spinosad dust treatment. Generally, the presence of SilicoSec combined with spinosad did not significantly increase S. oryzae mortality compared with spinosad alone. For T confusum, mortality on both commodities was lower than for S. oryzae. After 14d of exposure on wheat, mortality was 14% at the highest dose of spinosad, but increased to 33% in the presence of DE. Similar results were also obtained for T confusum exposed on treated maize, which indicated a joint action between spinosad and DE. In the case of S. oryzae, the inclusion of DE reduced progeny production in comparison with spinosad alone. Progeny production of T confusum was relatively low in all treatments, compared to progeny production of S. oryzae.

K-glyphosate exhibited first-order penetration kinetics, and rate constants (k) increased with increasing humidity. Caglyphosate penetrated only when the humidity above the salt residue was 100%. At 90% humidity and below, Ca-glyphosate formed a solid residue on the CMs and penetration was not measurable. With Ca-glyphosate, the k value at 100% humidity decreased with time and the initial rates were lower than for K-glyphosate by a factor of 3.68. After equimolar concentrations of ammonium oxalate were added to Ca-glyphosate, high penetration rates close to those measured with K-glyphosate were measured at all humidities. Adding ammonium sulfate or potassium carbonate also increased rates between 70 and 100% humidity, but they were not as high as with ammonium oxalate. The data indicate that at pH 4.0 one Ca2+ ion is bound to two glyphosate anions. This salt has its deliquescence point near 100% humidity. Therefore, it is a solid at lower humidity and does not penetrate. Its molecular weight is 1.82 times larger than that of K-glyphosate, and this greatly slows down rates of penetration, even at 100% humidity. The additives tested have low solubility products and form insoluble precipitates with Ca2+ ions, but only ammonium oxalate binds Ca2+ quantitatively. The resulting ammonium salt of glyphosate penetrates at 70-100% humidity and at rates comparable to K-glyphosate. The results contribute to a better understanding of the hard water antagonism observed with glyphosate. It is argued that other pesticides and hormones with carboxyl functions are likely to respond to Ca2+ ions in a similar fashion. In all of these cases, ammonium oxalate is expected to overcome hard water antagonism.",2004,52,6546,6551,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf049500s

Mortality of earwigs on control plants was less than 15% at 2 days postapplication compared to 33% on plants treated with granular chlorpyrifos, 83% on plants sprayed with 160 ppm Spinosad, and 91-95% on plants treated with 200-2000 ppm Spinosad granules, respectively. Further mortality in the 24-h period postsampling ranged from <5% in control treatments, to 9% in the chlorpyrifos treatment, and to 55-65% in the Spinosad spray and granule treatments. We conclude that Spinosad cannot be considered to have an environmental safety profile similar to most established biological insecticides.

These are organophosphate (OP) insecticides and synthetic pyrethroid (SP) insecticides. SPs are deemed to be less toxic to human health than OPs, although they are approximately 100 times more toxic to some elements of the aquatic environment. Three insecticides were selected for experimental investigation: diazinon, propetamphos (OPs) and cis-permethrin (SP), representative of the active ingredients used in sheep dip formulations, with additional uses in insect control in crops, and for domestic control of flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, lice, ticks and spiders. The UK Government has recently reviewed agricultural practices relating to the disposal of used sheep dip, because the constituent insecticides are frequently detected in UK watercourses and the presence of these compounds is a severe hazard to the aquatic environment. Standard batch sorption experiments were carried out to investigate insecticide partitioning from water to soil, and the relationship between sorption and soil organic carbon content is discussed. Sorption isotherms and K, values showed that cis-permethrin adsorption was fastest on all five soils investigated, exhibiting the greatest total partitioning to the soil phase (83.8-94.8%) and high resistance to desorption. In comparison, the OP insecticides exhibited moderately strong soil adsorption as evidenced by their K-d coefficients (diazinon K-d 12-35 and propetamphos K-d 9-60), with low sorption reversibility (<15%). Calculation of a hydrological retardation factor in a scenario representative of a typical UK environment suggested that SP insecticides such as cis-permethrin will not migrate in the soil profile due to their virtual immobility and strong soil retention, and thus waste sheep dip disposal to agricultural land should not pose a risk to aquatic life if applied with appropriate controls.

Women of reproductive age (137 persons 15-49 yr old) and their spouses (137 persons) were interviewed to obtain data on current health status, history, lifestyle, including past and current occupational exposure to pesticides, and factors including those known to be associated with increased frequency of micronuclei (MN). In regions where glyphosate was being sprayed, blood samples were taken prior to spraying (indicative of baseline exposure), 5 d after spraying, and 4 mo after spraying. Lymphocytes were cultured and a cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay was applied to evaluate chromosomal damage and cytotoxicity. Compared with Santa Marta, where organic coffee is grown without pesticides, the baseline frequency of binucleated cells with micronuclei (BNMN) was significantly greater in subjects from the other four regions. The highest frequency of BNMN was in Boyaca, where no aerial eradication spraying of glyphosate was conducted, and in Valle del Cauca, where glyphosate was used for maturation of sugar cane. Region, gender, and older age (epsilon 35 yr) were the only variables associated with the frequency of BNMN measured before spraying. A significant increase in frequency of BNMN between first and second sampling was observed in Narino, Putumayo, and Valle immediately (5 d) after spraying. In the post-spray sample, those who reported direct contact with the eradication spray showed a higher quantitative frequency of BNMN compared to those without glyphosate exposure. The increase in frequency of BNMN observed immediately after the glyphosate spraying was not consistent with the rates of application used in the regions and there was no association between self-reported direct contact with eradication sprays and frequency of BNMN. Four months after spraying, a statistically significant decrease in the mean frequency of BNMN compared with the second sampling was observed in Narino, but not in Putumayo and Valle del Cauca. Overall, data suggest that genotoxic damage associated with glyphosate spraying for control of illicit crops as evidenced by MN test is small and appears to be transient. Evidence indicates that the genotoxic risk potentially associated with exposure to glyphosate in the areas where the herbicide is applied for coca and poppy eradication is low.",2009,72,986,997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15287390902929741

This bait type was chosen to facilitate its eventual commercial use. Two applications were performed: in the first, baits with 1x10(8) conidia/g were utilized while in the second employed concentrations 5 to 8.6 times greater. The baits were formulated with a citric pulp base, with 2 isolates of Beauveria bassiana, 1 of Paecilomyces lilacinus and 1 of Isaria fumosorosea. The following controls were utilized: (I) baits with sulfluramid insecticide, (II) without active ingredient, and (III) Acalypha spp. leaf discs. It was verified that the baits containing fungal conidia were rapidly carried to the nest interior in both applications and were rejected minimally. Thus, the (dry) granulated bait formulation appears to be an adequate vehicle for entomopathogenic fungi. At the doses and concentrations utilized, the fungi provoked only limited worker mortality, not killing the colonies. Given the rapid carrying and low rejection, a higher conidial dose per colony can, perhaps, kill them. Thus, it is inferred that all the isolates tested present potential as an agent to control colonies of leaf-cutting ants.",2012,59,681,689,NA

The fungicide formulation was also composed of polyoxyethylene nonylphenol (NP-40) and methanol. Patient concerns: Severe cholestatic hepatitis developed, which led to the patient's death on day 88 of hospitalization. Postmortem necropsy of the liver showed focal hepatocyte necrosis involving mostly the mid-zone, along with intracytoplasmic and intracanalicular cholestasis. Diagnoses: To identify the chemical responsible for hepatic injury, the cellular toxicity of all chemicals in the fungicide formulation was assessed in HepG2 cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiaxol-2yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test. Outcomes: Viability of cells treated with the surfactant NP-40 was significantly lower (P<.001), but that of cells treated with other components of the fungicide, including the active ingredient, iminoctadine triacetate, was unaffected. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirmed that necrosis was induced in HepG2 cells treated with 25-80 mu M of NP-40, while significant numbers of apoptotic cells were not detected.

Recently, non-animal approaches including the KeratinoSens (TM) assay have been developed for predicting skin sensitization potential. Assessing the utility of the KeratinoSens (TM) assay for use with multi-component mixtures such as agrochemical formulations has not been previously evaluated and is a significant need. This study was undertaken to evaluate the KeratinoSens (TM) assay prediction potential for agrochemical formulations. The assay was conducted for 8 agrochemical active ingredients (AIs) including 3 sensitizers (acetochlor, meptyldinocap, triclopyr), 5 non-sensitizers (aminopyralid, clopyralid, florasulam, methoxyfenozide, oxyfluorfen) and 10 formulations for which in vivo sensitization data were available. The KeratinoSens (TM) correctly predicted the sensitization potential of all the AIs. For agrochemical formulations it was necessary to modify the standard assay procedure whereby the formulation was assumed to have a common molecular weight. The resultant approach correctly predicted the sensitization potential for 3 of 4 sensitizing formulations and all 6 non-sensitizing formulations when compared to in vivo data. Only the meptyldinocap-containing formulation was misclassified, as a result of high cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate the promising utility of the KeratinoSens (TM) assay for evaluating the skin sensitization potential of agrochemical AIs and formulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The rate of release of the incorporated herbicides was a function of both the properties of the herbicide and the composition of the CRF. The rate of release of herbicides was related their aqueous solubility; the greater the solubility of a compound, the more rapid its release from a CRF. The rate of release of the chemicals from pectin-based CRFs was generally greater than from alginate-based CRFs. This seems to be related to the relatively large number of methoxy groups in the pectin, which hinders the gelation process and results in a more porous matrix than in the case of alginate. The addition of sodium montmorillonite to these CRFs was found to have a profound inhibitory effect on the release of alachlor. This was attributed to the sorption of the herbicide to the clay mineral. Other clays generally had little or no effect on the rate of release of the active ingredient. Bead radius was observed to have a profound effect on release rates; the smaller the radius, the greater the release rate.

Here, we used the PC12 neuronal cell line to examine the effect of bifenthrin on the formation of neurites and the potential developmental neurotoxicity of this pesticide. Material/Methods: PC12 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of technical grade bifenthrin or Ortho Home Defense (R). Cell viability was determined using the AlmarBlue Toxicity Assay Nontoxic concentrations of these chemicals were concomitantly with nerve growth factor and neurite Outgrowth was assessed. Results: Ortho Home Defense (R) preparation reduced PC12 cell viability by approximately 50% and 70% at dilutions that correlate to bifenthrin concentrations of 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M, respectively. In contrast, technical grade bifenthrin, was not toxic to PC12 cells at 10(-3) M, which was the highest concentration tested that was soluble.

Conclusions: These data suggest that the toxicity of the Ortho Home Defense (R) preparation was due to the inert additives in the preparation and not the bifenthrin itself.

However, insecticide resistance poses a continuous threat to the viability of these management tools and thus, on food availability. Since there is very limited information available on the existence of resistant/tolerant insect populations in Greece, the objective of our study was to investigate the tolerance status of insect populations sampled from Greek warehouses and silos to a wide range of insecticides. According to our data, all field-collected insect populations indicated different patterns of tolerance, suggesting the occurrence of possible resistance to widely used insecticides. Our findings can be used for the reduction of the cases of control failures by revising the current pest management practices followed by Greek farmers and operators in stored product protection. The protection of stored products from insect pests is mainly based on suppressive methods by using contact and gaseous insecticides, globally. Following their continuous and improper use, insecticide resistance has been observed in several major insect species and pose a continuous threat to the sustainability of a wide range of active ingredients that are currently in use in stored product protection. In the present work, on-site samplings of insect populations were carried out in local warehouses containing different types of cereals. The collected insects, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.)

Laboratory populations of the same species were also examined for comparative purposes. Adult knock down and mortality of all populations indicated different patterns of tolerance to phosphine, deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and pirimiphos-methyl.

Given that house flies are associated closely with human and livestock activity, they present medical and veterinary health concerns. Although there are numerous strategies for control of house fly populations, chemical control has been favored in many facilities. Products with pyrethroid active ingredients have been used predominantly for >35 years in space sprays. As a result, strong selection for pyrethroid resis-tance has led to reduced control of many populations. Reliance on a limited number of insecticides for decades has created fly control problems necessitating the discovery and formulation of new control chemistries.Fluralaner is a relatively new insecticide and acaricide (first reported in 2010), belonging to the isoxazoline class. These insecticides target the glutamate-and gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated (GABA) chloride channels, which is a different mode of action from other insecticides used against house flies. Although is it not currently registered for house fly control in the United States, previous work has shown that fluralaner is highly toxic to house flies and that there was limited cross-resistance found in laboratory strains having high levels of resistance to other insecticides.Herein, we characterized the time and age dependency of fluralaner toxicity, detected cross-resistance in populations from across the United States, and selected a highly resistant (>11,000-fold) house fly strain. We found that the fluralaner LD50 of 18-24 h old flies was 2-fold higher than for 5-6 d old flies. This appears to be due to more rapid penetration of fluralaner into the 5-6 d old flies. Fluralaner resistance was inherited as an intermediate to incompletely dominant trait and was mapped to chromosomes 5 and 3. Resistance could be suppressed to 7-fold with piperonyl butoxide, suggesting that cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated detoxification was a major mechanism of resistance. Decreased penetration was also demonstrated as a mechanism of resis-tance.

Nevertheless, the uptake of this intervention has been hampered by the need to re-apply larvicides frequently. There is a need to explore persistent, environmentally friendly larvicides for malaria vector control to reduce intervention efforts and costs by reducing the frequency of application. In this study, the efficacy of a 0.5% pyriproxyfen granule (Surmilarv (R) 0.5G, Sumitomo Chemicals) was assessed for the control of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles arabiensis, the major malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Dose-response and standardized field tests were implemented following standard procedures of the World Health Organization's Pesticide Evaluation Scheme to determine: (i) the susceptibility of vectors to this formulation; (ii) the residual activity and appropriate retreatment schedule for field application; and, (iii) sub-lethal impacts on the number and viability of eggs laid by adults after exposure to SumilarvW0.5G during larval development. Results: Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis were highly susceptible to SumilarvW0.5G. Estimated emergence inhibition (EI) values were very low and similar for both species. The minimum dosage that completely inhibited adult emergence was between 0.01-0.03 parts per million (ppm) active ingredient (ai). Compared to the untreated control, an application of 0.018 ppm ai prevented 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 82%-88%) of adult emergence over six weeks under standardized field conditions. A fivefold increase in dosage of 0.09 ppm ai prevented 97% (95% CI 94%-98%) emergence. Significant sub-lethal effects were observed in the standardized field tests. Female An. gambiae s.s. that were exposed to 0.018 ppm ai as larvae laid 47% less eggs, and females exposed to 0.09 ppm ai laid 74% less eggs than females that were unexposed to the treatment. Furthermore, 77% of eggs laid by females exposed to 0.018 ppm ai failed to hatch, whilst 98% of eggs laid by females exposed to 0.09 ppm ai did not hatch. Conclusion: Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis are highly susceptible to Sumilarv (R) 0.5G at very low dosages. The persistence of this granule formulation in treated habitats under standardized field conditions and its sub-lethal impact, reducing the number of viable eggs from adults emerging from treated ponds, enhances its potential as malaria vector control tool. These unique properties warrant further field testing to determine its suitability for inclusion in malaria vector control programmes.",2013,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-12-94

The field populations were collected from storage facilities in Greece and were characterized as resistant by using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) protocol, based on the same protocol, populations were characterized as susceptible to phosphine. The insecticides were applied at three dose rates (0.1,1 and 10 ppm) on wheat and adult mortality was measured after 7,14 and 21 days of exposure, while progeny production was assessed 65 days later. For S. oryzae populations, complete control was noted at the highest dose on pirimiphos-methyl and spinetoram, while mortality caused by alpha-cypermethrin was 62 and 100% for the field and laboratory populations, respectively. For O. surinamensis, complete control was recorded at the highest dose only on alpha-cypermethrin for the laboratory population, in contrast with the field population, where mortality was only 32% after 21 days of exposure. In general, the variations among populations were negligible for spinetoram, probably due to the fact that the populations tested were not previously exposed to this active ingredient. In contrast, the lowest susceptibility of the field populations to the other two insecticides can be attributed to the fact that these populations might have been exposed to these active ingredients, while any hypothesis for cross-resistance with phosphine has to be examined more thoroughly.

Important innovation as compared to other terbuthylazine-containing herbicide combinations is the active ingredient mesotrione for control of triazine-resistant weed biotypes and some annual grasses. 1.5 1/ha SYD 11'460 H in maize control a wide spectrum of annual broad-leaved weeds including triazine-resistant biotypes, Poa annua as well as Echinochloa and Digilaria species. Application of SYD 11'460 H occurs post-emergent to crop and weeds at 1-6 leaf stage of maize, to grasses until mid tillering at the latest. After post-emergent application, mesotrione offers predominantly foliar activity on sensitive plants, terbuthylazine both foliar and root activity. Both compounds are taken up by root and shoot. The synergistic interaction of two independent modes of action results in a more than additive enhancement of efficacy on a broad weed spectrum including some grasses, enabling a significant reduction of use rates as compared to single use of both active ingredients. SYD 11'460 H has reliable and quick foliar and root activity; its duration of efficacy enables sustainable weed control during the critical early growth stages of maize. The herbicide combination SYD 11'460 H is suitable as a residual basic herbicide for post-emergent use in maize, performing an excellent crop tolerance. It offers an innovative contribution for consistent and highly flexible control of a wide broad-leaved weed flora including some of the most important annual grasses in Central European maize cropping systems.",2004,NA,657,665,NA

To investigate volatile pyrethroids in blends containing multiple active ingredients, metofluthrin was formulated into a vegetation spray for application to foliage and mosquito harborage. Metofluthrin was compared by itself and in combination with Sector (permethrin), Hyperion (sumithrin), Onslaught Fast Cap (s-fenvalerate, prallethrin), and against a benchmark for comparison, OneGuard (lambda-cyhalothrin, prallethrin, pyriproxyfen). Field sites with established Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) populations were allocated as control and treatment and surveilled with both adult traps and oviposition cups before and after treatment. Adult mosquito reductions were consistently higher over 4 wk in the combination treatments and were comparable to OneGuard. In contrast, efficacy provided by metofluthrin alone or the standalone existing product (Sector, Hyperion, Onslaught) by were consistently less effective than OneGuard and the comparative blends. Additionally, poorly melanized and collapsing eggs were identified from mosquito adults collected at treated field sites. A 20-50% significant decrease in nonviable mosquito eggs, a 50% or more reduction in total eggs and an 80% or more reduction in adult mosquitoes collected at the local field sites was demonstrated across all metofluthrin-containing treatments. Metofluthrin applications both supplemented the adulticidal control of the selected pyrethroid-containing products and provided significant reduction in egg laying frequency and viability during monitoring of areas adjacent to the treated vegetation.

Synchronous with breeding events (May-July), embryos and tadpoles were exposed, in situ and in the laboratory, to study site pond water for 2 to 3 weeks. Six pesticides commonly applied in apple orchards (Guthion(R) 50WP, Imidan(R) 50WP, Thiodan(R) 50WP, Dithane(R) DG, Nova(R) 40W, and Basudin(R) 500EC) and technical grade diazinon were also evaluated for direct toxicity to green frogs using continuous and discontinuous toxicity tests. Embryos and larvae exhibited poor hatching success and survival at some orchard sites during in situ assays, but no specific water source produced consistently poor developmental success. Reduced tadpole growth occurred at several study sites, showing no clear distinction between reference and orchard sites. Despite the collection of substantial environmental data, only surface water temperature appeared to be correlated with growth rates. Basudin 500EC, technical grade diazinon, and Dithane DG caused mortality, deformities, or growth inhibition during early development at environmentally relevant concentrations (<0.01 mg/L), whereas Imidan 50WP, Guthion 50WP, and Nova 40W produced survival or growth effects at much higher levels (5-10 mg/L). Dithane DG (mancozeb) was acutely toxic during prolonged exposures, and sublethal growth and deformity responses occurred at nominal concentrations greater than 0.01 mg/L.

Its larvae cause severe damage to apples, pears, quinces and walnuts. Resistance of CM to commonly used conventional insecticides (organophosphates and pyrethroids), which has already been noted in Bulgaria, as well as restrictions on insecticide use imposed by EU regulations, have encouraged a new approach to the control of this pest. Alternative methods have been extensively tested during the last few years. Mating disruption appears as a very promising solution. CheckMate (R) CM-F is a sprayable microencapsulated sex pheromone formulation, containing the active ingredient (E, E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol (14.3%), has recently been introduced into many countries for the mating disruption of codling moth. Trials comparing this encapsulated sprayable pheromone against conventional CM control practices were carried out during two consecutive years (2007-2008), in central north Bulgaria. The microencapsulated pheromone (183 ml of CheckMate (R) CM-F per ha) was applied 6 times per season at 22-25 day intervals. In both years, it totally suppressed captures of male moths in codlemone baited traps in the trial plot. The fruit damage in the pheromone-treated plot stayed at a very low level, amounting at harvest 0.13% in 2007 and 0.3% in 2008 and the overwintering CM population in autumn was 0.55 and 0.65 larvae per tree in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In contrast, in the reference orchard, treated 9-11 times per season with conventional insecticides, fruit damage reached 2.3% in 2007 and 2.7% in 2008 and the hibernating CM population was 1.05 in 2007 and 1.85 larvae per tree in 2008. In conclusion, it was evident that applications of Check Mate (R) CM-F can provide an effective control of codling moth, with better results than the conventional protection program in Bulgaria and should be implemented in commercial apple production.",2012,933,485,490,NA

Current research describes the formation of oil-in-water (O/W) diazinon nanoemulsions using synthetic and natural additives by adopting a high-energy (ultrasound) emulsification method. The diazinon nanoemulsions were spontaneously formed by adding dropwise a mixture of diazinon, solvent and co-solvent in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant (tween or lecithin) with continuous stirring. The nanoemulsions were then formed by ultra-sonication. The effects of three levels of active ingredient, solvent, co-solvent, surfactant, sonication time and sonication cycle and power were performed by Minitab software to design the experiment. Effects of these factors on droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), viscosity and pH of nanoemulsions were investigated. The results of the modeling showed that the experimental data could be adequately adapted in a second-order polynomial model with a multiple regression coefficient r(2) of 0.821 for the prediction of particle size, PDI and viscosity. The long-term and thermodynamic stability of the prepared nanoemulsions were tested. The droplet size and morphology of the nanoemulsions were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On this basis, a water-insoluble insecticide diazinon was incorporated into 26 optimized nanoemulsion systems to demonstrate potential applications in pest control. The results of DLS and TEM measurements showed that most of prepared nanoemulsions had an almost monodisperse droplet size distribution (PDI < 200 nm). Incorporation of diazinon had no significant effect on the size and stability of the nanoemulsions and the formulated nanoemulsion remained stable after four months of storage.",2017,52,896,911,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2017.1362941

We evaluated field residues and experimental applications of an anthraquinone-based repellent (active ingredient 50% 9,10-anthraquinone) to minimize red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus Linnaeus) depredation of oilseed sunflower. Chemical residues from experimental applications of the anthraquinone-based repellent (4.7 1/ha and 9.4 1/ha; low, high) in a ripening oilseed sunflower field were 481 ppm and 978 ppm anthraquinone at the beginning of blackbird damage, and 385 ppm and 952 ppm anthraquinone at the end of blackbird damage, respectively. Prior to harvest, we observed 402 ppm and 462 ppm anthraquinone in the oil, and 27 ppm and 165 ppm anthraquinone in the pomace from crushed sunflower achenes previously sprayed with the low and high applications, respectively. For the purpose of developing application strategies useful for avian repellents, we subsequently investigated blackbird feeding response to oilseed sunflower treated with the anthraquinone-based repellent and either a registered insecticide or a registered fungicide popularly used for ripening sunflower. We observed a positive concentration response relationship among blackbirds exposed to anthraquinone and the insecticide (a.i. 8.4% esfenvalerate), or anthraquinone and the fungicide (a.i. 23.6% pyraclostrobin). Blackbirds reliably discriminated between untreated sunflower and that treated with 1810 ppm anthraquinone and 0.1% of the insecticide or 1700 ppm anthraquinone and 0.14% of the fungicide during our preference experiments. Given that ripening achenes are inverted from conventional pesticide applications throughout much of the period associated with blackbird depredation, we also evaluated blackbird repellency of the anthraquinone-based repellent applied to involucral bracts (i.e., the back of sunflower heads) of oilseed sunflower. Blackbirds did not discriminate between untreated involucral bracts and those treated with foliar applications comparable to 4.7 1/ha or 9.4 1/ha; blackbirds consumed more achenes from untreated sunflower heads than from those treated with 18.7 1/ha of the anthraquinone-based repellent.

Most new postemergence broadleaf herbicides combine several active ingredients, possibly resulting in synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects. Therefore, as new herbicides become available, information is needed about their performance when applied in the spring. The objective of our study was to determine the effect of spring application timing on dandelion control with seven commercially available postemergence herbicides. Products were applied at their lowest labeled rate for dandelion control at three spring application timings, which coincided with dandelion anthesis stages (pre-, peak-, or post-bloom). A grid was used to determine percent dandelion control at several rating dates. The 2010 site had a denser turfgrass stand with smaller dandelions and was irrigated more frequently compared with the 2011 site. In 2010, all herbicides gave 98% or greater control at 30 days after treatment (DAT) when applied post-bloom; when applied pre- or peak-bloom, control was 80% or greater for all herbicides except for two products applied peak-bloom. At pre- and peak-bloom, products combining a protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor with a 2,4-D ester formulation were superior to most other herbicides. When evaluated at the end of the growing season in 2010, all herbicides provided 89% or greater control at all three timings. In 2011, with a less dense turfgrass stand, larger dandelions, and less frequent irrigation, control was more variable and shorter-lived among herbicides. When applied pre-bloom, all products containing 2,4-D provided 87% or greater control 60 DAT. Post-bloom application generally gave similar control to the pre-bloom timing. Peak-bloom application resulted in the poorest overall control at 60 DAT, but products combining a PPO inhibitor with a 2,4-D ester formulation performed better than most other herbicides. By the end of the season, dandelion regrowth caused reduced overall control at all timings, but overall control was poorest when applied at peak-bloom. In summary, peak-bloom applications should be avoided, especially if dandelion pressure is high. Products combining PPO inhibitors with ester forms of 2,4-D were most effective across all spring application timings. Products containing amine forms of 2,4-D may provide effective control if applied pre- or post-bloom.",2014,49,1212,1216,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.49.9.1212

Push-pull strategies have been successful in integrated crop pest management. Through the combinatory use of deterring and attracting stimuli, the abundance of insect pests can be changed in a given area. A push-pull strategy might also reduce human-vector contacts and augment existing mosquito control strategies, e.g. through the combination of an attractive trapping system and spatial repellent. Several volatile pyrethroids have been tested for their spatial repellent (push) potential. However, the use of insecticides conflicts with the general idea of push-pull as a non-toxic means of pest management. In addition, constant human exposure to insecticides should be avoided and further insecticide resistance in the target population needs to be prevented which necessitates the screening for effective, non-toxic spatial repellents. This chapter discusses techniques that allow for a more realistic evaluation of spatial repellents under laboratory conditions before they are tested in the (semi-)field and introduces a push-pull approach that uses the BG-Sentinel trap in combination with catnip oil (Nepeta cataria), a known spatial repellent for Aedes aegypti. Different candidate materials were evaluated in y-tube olfactometer assays and the efficacy of the most promising candidates was subsequently verified within a larger scaled room test. The novel room test included a dispensing system that created a repellent-loaded air curtain which had to be overcome by the mosquitoes in order to reach an attractive trap or human volunteer located behind. Best results were obtained with a dispensing system using conventional fans and a repellent sachet containing polymer granules with catnip oil. In these experiments, mosquito attraction to a BGS-trap was reduced by 70% in push-only set-ups. The indoor success was attributed to a homogenous and constant dispersal of active ingredients, as confirmed by quantification experiments using thermal desorption gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Successful protection of a human volunteer was achieved in push-pull experiments using catnip oil in combination with the BGS trap. In these experiments, human landing collections were reduced by 50%. In semi-field tests in Florida, comparable protective effects could not be verified and further research on suitable repellent concentrations and formulations for outdoor implementation are required.",2018,1289,187,204,NA

In the UK it is estimated that over 8% of the area covered by arable crops is treated with formulated granular bait pellets containing metaldehyde as the main active ingredient. Metaldehyde is hydrophilic (log Kow = 0.12), water soluble (200 mg.L-1 at 17 degrees C) and has been detected in UK surface waters in the concentration range of typically 0.2-0.6 mu g.L-1 (maximum 2.7 mu g.L-1) during 2008-2011. In the absence of chronic data on potential hazards to non-target freshwater molluscs, a laboratory study was conducted to investigate the impact of metaldehyde on embryo development in the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis (RENILYS strain) and using zinc as a positive control. L. stagnalis embryos were exposed to metaldehyde under semi-static conditions at 20 +/- 1 degrees C and hatching success and growth (measured as shell height and intraocular distance) examined after 21 d. Exposure concentrations were verified using HPLC and gave 21 d (NOEC)-N-hatching and (LOEC)-L-hatching mean measured values of 36 and 116 mg MET.L-1, respectively (equal to the 21 d (shell) (NOEC)-N-height and (LOEC)-L-shell height values). For basic research purposes, a second group of L. stagnalis embryos was co-exposed to metaldehyde and the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Co-exposure to the PBO (measured concentrations between 0.47-0.56 mg.L-1) reduced hatching success from 100% to 47% and resulted in a 30% reduction in embryo growth (shell height) in snail embryos co-exposed to metaldehyde at 34-36 mg.

Preliminary whole-plant greenhouse assays confirm most Palmer amaranth populations found in Indiana are glyphosate-resistant (GR), and some biotypes exhibit tolerance to 2,4-D amine. Dose-response experiments were conducted to determine the level of glyphosate resistance and 2,4-D amine tolerance in four Palmer amaranth biotypes. A premix formulation of glyphosate plus 2,4-D choline was also evaluated. The R1, R2, and R3 biotypes were 31- to 66-fold more resistant to glyphosate (R:S ratio) than the S1 biotype based on the herbicide dose to cause 90% mortality (LD90). The maximum POST rate of the premix formulation of Enlist Duo (R) labeled in 'Enlist (R) soybean is 2,195 g ae ha(-1). When separated by active ingredient, the maximum POST rate of Enlist Duo (R) is equivalent to 1,141 and 1,054 g ae ha(-1) of glyphosate and 2,4-D choline, respectively. In the absence ofyphosate, the maximum rate of 2,4-D (1,054 g ae ha(-1) ) in the premix formulation of Enlist Duo (R) controlled S1, R2, and R3 biotypes, but failed to control all plants from the R1 biotype. Estimates for LD90 showed the R1 biotype was 3-fold more tolerant than the S1 biotype to 2,4-D amine. However, no plants survived the 1,155 g ae ha(-1) (600 g ae ha(-1) of glyphosate plus 555 g ae ha(-1) 2,4-D) treatment with the premix formulation of glyphosate plus 2,4-D choline. Overall, results from this experiment suggest GR Palmer amaranth that also exhibits increased tolerance to 2,4-D amine will be difficult to control with glyphosate or 2,4-D alone, but can be controlled POST with Enlist Duo (R) at lower than labeled field rates (1,618 to 2,195 g ae ha(-1)).",2017,65,787,797,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wsc.2017.50

We investigated how the combination of the invasive mussel Limnoperna fortunei and a widely applied herbicide, Roundup Max (R), affected freshwater microscopic communities and water quality. Further, we compared these results with those induced by the combination of the mussel and technical-grade glyphosate. We carried out a 34-day experiment in outdoor mesocosms, applying the following six treatments: 6 mg L-1 of technical-grade glyphosate (G), the equivalent concentration of glyphosate in Roundup Max (R) (R), 100 mussels (M), the combination of mussels and herbicide either in the technical-grade or formulated form (MG and MR, respectively), and control (C). Herbicides significantly increased total phosphorus in water; R and MR showed greater initial total nitrogen and ammonium. R increased picoplankton abundance and caused an eightfold increase in phytoplankton, with high turbidity values; G had a lower effect on these variables. Herbicide-mussel combination induced an accelerated dissipation of glyphosate in water (MG 6.36 +/- 0.83 mg G g DW-1 day(-1) and MR 5.16 +/- 1.26 mg G g DW-1 day(-1)). A synergistic effect on ammonium was observed in MR but not in MG. MR and MG had an antagonistic effect on phytoplankton, which showed a drastic reduction due to grazing, as revealed by M. We provide evidence of differential effects of Roundup Max (R) and technical-grade glyphosate over water quality and microscopic communities, and in combination with mussels. However, in the combination of mussels and herbicides, mussels seem to play a leading role. In the presence of L. fortunei, the effects of higher nutrient availability provided by herbicides addition were counteracted by the filtration activity of mussels, which released nutrients, grazed on picoplankton and phytoplankton, and boosted the development of other primary producers, periphyton and metaphyton.",2016,23,18869,18882,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7005-6

We therefore conducted two replicated experiments using spray treatments containing single or multiple modes of action (MoA) insecticides to reduce the incidence of these two pests in bearing citrus. Tank mixing in 47 L.ha(-1) (5 gal/acre) of waterwith synthetic plant terpenes (Requiem 25 EC, Unknown MoA) or adjuvant petroleum oil (PureSpray Green, Unknown MoA) did not improve the effectiveness of the pyrethroid zeta-cypermethrin (Mustang Max 0.15 EC, MoA 3A) against D. citri. Its control with flupyradifurone (Sivanto 200 SL MoA 4D) and PureSpray Green in 935 L.ha(-1) (100 gal/acre) water was similar to Mustang Max 0.15 EC and Requiem 25EC, but mixtures did not provide better control than Mustang Max 0.15 EC alone.

Difenoconazole (EC50 < 0.12mg/l) and colloidal silver (EC50 < 76 mg/l) were the most effective fungicides. No strains resistant to the aforementioned fungicides were found. In most cases, azoxystrobin was effective against H. solani (EC50 < 7 mg/l), but there were several strains with high resistance to this fungicide (EC50 > 100 mg/l). Thiabendazole appears to be effective against the sensitive strains of H. solani (EC50 < 7.3 mg/l); however, six studied strains from Russia and the Netherlands were found to be extremely resistant to it (EC50 > 1000 mg/l). The sequence of their beta-tubulin gene contained a SNP mutation in the 198 codon or 200 codon, translating to Gln (CAG) instead of Glu (GAG) or Tyr (TAC) instead of Phe (TTC), respectively.

Pesticide residues present in raw agricultural products can degrade or react during food processing steps. To date, the fate of nanopesticides during food processing has not been well described. In this study, the thermal degradation of azoxystrobin (AZOX) in conventional and nanoencapsulated (Allosperse and nSiO(2)) formulations was first assessed in water, spiked strawberry, and incurred strawberry models. The thermal degradation followed first-order kinetics when heated at 100 degrees C in the water model. The thermal degradation of AZOX in nanoformulations in strawberry models (189.0 AZOX decrease) was comparable to or lower than in the conventional formulation (21%), possibly due to the nanocarriers protecting the active ingredient from hydrolytic degradation. Out of 32 thermal degradation products (TDPs), only two were detected in both the spiked water and strawberry models, indicating differences in the thermal degradation reactions for AZOX in these two models. Identical TDPs were detected for both conventional and nanoformulations for each specific model, except for the absence of one (TDP22) in the nSiO(2) formulations. The nanoencapsulation of AZOX did not result in new TDPs in any of the matrices. Only six of the TDPs detected in water, four in spiked strawberries, and two in incurred strawberries have been previously reported in environmental studies on the metabolism of AZOX. Based on the observed TDPs, AZOX thermal degradation pathways include ether cleavage, hydrolysis, demethylation, and decarboxylation. Overall, although nanocarriers have no impact on the degradation product types, nanocarriers had a slight but significant impact on the degradation rate of pesticide active ingredients.",2022,2,960,968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsagscitech.2c00119

Insecticide control of the aphid vector is limited due to insecticide resistance and the banning of the most effective active ingredients in the EU. There is only one source of TuYV resistance in current commercial OSR varieties, which has been mapped to a single dominant quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome A04. We report the identification, characterisation, and mapping of TuYV resistance in the diploid progenitor species of OSR, Brassica rapa (genome: AA), and Brassica oleracea (genome: CC). Phenotyping of F-1 populations, produced from within-species crosses between resistant and susceptible individuals, revealed the resistances were quantitative and partially dominant. QTL mapping of segregating backcross populations showed that the B. rapa resistance was controlled by at least two additive QTLs, one on chromosome A02 and the other on chromosome A06. Together, they explained 40.3% of the phenotypic variation. In B. oleracea, a single QTL on chromosome C05 explained 22.1% of the phenotypic variation. The TuYV resistance QTLs detected in this study are different from those in the extant commercial resistant varieties. To exploit these resistances, an allotetraploid (genome: AACC) plant line was resynthesised from the interspecific cross between the TuYV-resistant B. rapa and B. oleracea lines. Flow cytometry confirmed that plantlets regenerated from the interspecific cross had both A and C genomes and were mixoploid. To stabilise ploidy, a fertile plantlet was self-pollinated to produce seed that had the desired resynthesised, allotetraploid genome AACC. Phenotyping of the resynthesised plants confirmed their resistance to TuYV. Genotyping with resistance-linked markers identified during the mapping in the progenitors confirmed the presence of all TuYV resistance QTLs from B. rapa and B. oleracea. This is the first report of TuYV resistance mapped in the Brassica C genome and of an allotetraploid AACC line possessing dual resistance to TuYV originating from both of its progenitors. The introgression into OSR can now be accelerated, utilising marker-assisted selection, and this may reduce selection pressure for TuYV isolates that are able to overcome existing sources of resistance to TuYV.",2021,12,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.781385

These losses pose a major problem for the California almond industry because of its dependence on honey bees as pollinators. The present study aimed to determine if combinations of pesticides applied during almond bloom during daylight hours were a possible explanation for these losses. In this study we aimed to mimic the spray application route of exposure to pesticides using a Potter Spray Tower to treat adult honey bees with commonly encountered pesticides and pesticide combinations at multiples of the maximum recommended field application rates. Tested insecticides included Altacor (R) and Intrepid (R), and tested fungicides included Tilt (R), Pristine (R), Luna Sensation (R), and Vangard (R). Synergistic toxicity was observed when the fungicide Tilt (active ingredient propiconazole) was applied with the insecticide Altacor (chlorantraniliprole), though neither caused significant mortality when applied independently. The study also looked at the effect of adding a spray adjuvant, Dyne-Amic (R), to pesticide mixtures. Dyne-Amic was toxic to honey bees at concentrations above the maximum recommended field application rate, and toxicity was increased when combined with the fungicide Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid). Addition of Dyne-Amic also increased toxicity of the Tilt and Altacor combination. These results suggest that application of Altacor and Tilt in combination with an adjuvant at the recommended field application rates could cause mortality in adult honey bees. These findings highlight a potential explanation for honey bee losses around almond bloom, emphasize that the safety of spray adjuvants to bees should not be assumed, and provide support for recommendations to protect bees from pesticides through application at night when bees are not foraging.

However, concerns regarding its safety, side effects, and impact on other organisms have increased in recent years. This is the first study to analyze a large set of recent and historical Escherichia coli isolates varying in pathogenicity and beta-lactam resistance from different host species for their susceptibility to glyphosate isopropylamine salt (IPA), the active ingredient of the herbicide, and to a complete glyphosate-containing formulation (Roundup LB Plus). For this, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for 238 E. coli isolates by broth microdilution in Mueller Hinton I media followed by the statistical analyses using Mann-Whitney-U test, multivariable analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a multivariable proportional-odds ordinal regression model. While the overall MIC distribution was narrow and lacked a highly resistant sub-population for both substances, statistical analyses revealed small but significant associations between glyphosate resistance levels and different factors tested. Mean MIC values for the entire dataset showed a higher level of resistance to the complete glyphosate-containing formulation (40 mg/ml IPA) than to pure glyphosate (10 mg/ml IPA) in E. coli. Isolates that originated from poultry had significantly higher MIC values for both pure glyphosate and the complete formulation. Pathogenic and non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (non-ESBL) E coil isolates each showed significantly higher MIC values compared to commensals and ESBL-producing E. coil in pure glyphosate, but not in the complete formulation. Recently sampled isolates showed statistically higher MICs than the isolates of the historic standard E. coil collection of reference in pure glyphosate, when tested by nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test, but not in the multivariable model. Further investigations are necessary to confirm whether these associations have a casual relationship with the glyphosate use or are the consequence of co-selection due to the increased application rates of antibiotics, heavy metals or other biocides.

High seed loading rates (50 g.kg(-1) active ingredient) are required for optimal efficacy, and conventional slurry methods are inadequate to apply these high loading rates. Film coating and pelleting were performed at Cornell Univ. to apply cyromazine and a registered fungicide (a formulation of thiram and carboxin) to onion seeds. Results of field studies performed over several years revealed that stand losses due to the onion maggot ranged from approximate to 20% to 60%. Cyromazine applied by either film coating or pelleting decreased the loss by onion maggot from 1% to 8%,and efficacy was comparable to an In-furrow application of chlorpyrifos. Cyromazine was registered as a seed treatment and is commercially used in the northeastern and midwestern United States, where onion maggot is a serious pest. Field emergence was not negatively affected by cyromazine coated onto the seeds when onion seeds are sown in organic (muck) soils. There is other evidence, however, that cyromazine seed treatments may cause phytotoxicity to germination and seedling growth. Testing seed quality in sand or on roll towels revealed a high percentage of abnormal seedlings. Retarded root growth was observed in seeds treated with cyromazine, resulting in an increase in abnormal seedling classifications. a finely ground sphagnum peatmoss applied over the seeds in a roll towel test ameliorated the abnormal root growth symptoms, and seedling had robust growth. Collectively, film coating and pelleting were effective delivery systems for the application of plant protectants required at time of sowing. Modification of the standard germination test was needed to accurately assess onion seed quality. Moreover, this project was successful due to a team Effort of a university seed scientist and entomologists working with onion growers and industry. Future registrations on small acreage, high-value horticultural crops are envisioned to require similar multi-partner approaches.

The embryotoxicity of Genamin T-200 (R) was quantified after 36 hr of exposure, considering both arrested development and abnormalities in D-shaped larvae. The ability of pediveliger larvae to metamorphose was studied after 24 hr exposure to Genamin T200 (R). According to the European toxicity classification, the present results suggest that Genamin T-200 (R) could be considered very toxic to embryo larval development, with an EC50 of 262 mu g/l, and toxic to metamorphosis processes with an EC50 of 3,027 mu g/l.

It is well known that alcohol glucosides have excellent aqueous solubility, a low temperature dependence compared to nonionic ethoxylates, and are stable in the presence of high levels of electrolytes. Furthermore, they are compatible with anionic, cationic, and other nonionic surfactants, making them extremely suitable for formulating concentrated products in the agrochemical area. In this paper, the synergistic effect of short-chained alkyl glucosides mixed with alcohol ethoxylates or amine derivatives have been investigated. These synergies have been manifested by lowering both surface tension and cmc as well as increasing wetting properties towards hydrophobic surfaces. The model system used contained agrochemical electrolytes such as glyphosate, MCPA-DMA salt and fertilizers. The relevance of the finding is supported by the increased bio-efficacy of a mixed adjuvant seen in a greenhouse test. Furthermore, this study shows that short-chained glucosides can be used as efficient solubilizers for adjuvants or wetting agents in high electrolyte system (i.e., fertilizers, active ingredients) to avoid phase separation. The effect has been assessed by studying the influence on cloud point as well as the amount of glucoside needed to solubilizer a nonionic wetting agent into a high electrolyte solution.",2005,1460,41,50,NA

Coumaphos particles were observed to remain well suspended in all pH treatments before, during, and for up to 1 h after applications were made on tick infested cattle, suggesting that there was no break in any of the coumaphos suspensions. Likewise, observations on the behavior of each of the animals (both treated and untreated) appeared to be similar and uniform across all groups, suggesting that the lowering of the pH would not cause any noticeable adverse reaction in the treated animals.

It is known that the penetration of pesticides into plant leaves is related to the physicochemical properties of the active ingredients, especially molecular size and lipophilicity. However, the uptake rate of a compound cannot be predicted by either of them or even combination of them. For a specific chemical, uptake varies greatly with plant species and there is no simple method at the moment to quickly evaluate the leaf surface permeability of a plant. Various adjuvants are being used to increase the penetration of pesticides into target plant foliage, but their effects vary with chemicals and plant species. The mechanisms of action of adjuvants in enhancing pesticide uptake remain unclear despite the effort made during the last three decades. Modern analytical and microscopic techniques provide powerful tools to deepen our understanding in this field. However, a more multidisciplinary approach is urgently needed to elucidate the transcuticular diffusion behaviour of pesticides and the mode of action of adjuvants. A better understanding of the foliar uptake process should lead to a more rational use of pesticides and minimize their negative impact on the environment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It acts by inhibiting an enzyme in an aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway specific to plants and microbes, leading to the view that it poses no risk to other organisms. However, there is growing concern that glyphosate is associated with health effects in humans and an everincreasing body of evidence that suggests potential deleterious effects on other animals including pollinating insects such as bees. Although pesticides have long been considered a factor in the decline of wild bee populations, most research on bees has focussed on demonstrating and understanding the effects of insecticides. To assess whether glyphosate poses a risk to bees, we characterised changes in survival, behaviour, sucrose solution consumption, the digestive tract proteome, and the microbiota in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris after chronic exposure to field relevant doses of technical grade glyphosate or the glyphosate-based formulation, RoundUp Optima+(R). Regardless of source, there were changes in response to glyphosate exposure in important cellular and physiological processes in the digestive tract of B. terrestris, with proteins associated with oxidative stress regulation, metabolism, cellular adhesion, the extracellular matrix, and various signalling pathways altered. Interestingly, proteins associated with endocytosis, oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, and carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism were differentially altered depending on whether the exposure source was glyphosate alone or RoundUp Optima+(R). In addition, there were alterations to the digestive tract microbiota of bees depending on the glyphosate source No impacts on survival, behaviour, or food consumption were observed. Our research provides insights into the potential mode of action and consequences of glyphosate exposure at the molecular, cellular and organismal level in bumblebees and highlights issues with the current honeybee-centric risk assessment of pesticides and their formulations, where the impact of coformulants on non-target organisms are generally overlooked.",2023,864,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161074

The effects of four environmental factors (temperature, pH, suspended sediment and algal food concentrations) on the acute toxicity of Roundup((R)) to C dubia were also examined. Generally, the toxicity order of the chemicals was: POEA > Roundup((R)) > glyphosate acid > IPA salt of glyphosate, while the toxicity of glyphosate acid was mainly due to its high acidity.

Results with seven different formulated termiticides indicate that the moniker repellent or non-repellent are a function of concentration not the purview of any particular class of chemistries. Bioavailability was evident in that mortality decreased with all active ingredients tested in bioassay with sandy loam soil compared to play sand with one exception, imidacloprid. Data included evidence that acquisition of a dermal dose is slow, requiring over one hour continuous exposure to treated sandy loam soil to produce >50% mortality at 10 ppm with all the formulations tested. Dermal and oral toxicities varied within all termiticides but one fipronil - and all but one, the chlorfenapyr formulation, affected worker termite performance on an experimental trail compared to controls. Three behavioral conditions that must be considered when interpreting termiticide efficacy bioassay data are also discussed. First, the main route of entry for subterranean termites confronted with a soil-based insecticide is oral. Second, assignment of the task of gallery construction to specific workers and third, a collective decision making system of communication used by worker termites traveling through a network of galleries. It is therefore unlikely that consistent transfer of soil-borne toxicants will follow field application of any termiticide.

The damage of this upper limit caused a loss of conidial viability and infectivity if not photoreactivated by light exposure after irradiation. Intriguingly, the light exposure resulted in a high photoreactivation rate of UVB-inactivated conidia and an insignificant or marginal difference in insecticidal activity between normal conidia and those photoreactivated. Modeling analysis of solar UVB intensity recorded hourly over the daylight of five sunny summer days from 5:00 am to 7:00 pm at 30 degrees 17'57 '' N and 120 degrees 5'7 '' E revealed a variation of daily accumulated UVB dose from 2.07 to 2.78 J cm(-2), which was far beyond the upper limit. A more tolerable dose of similar to 0.2 J cm(-2) appeared between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm, and no harmful dose accumulated between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm. CONCLUSION: Fungal UVB tolerance, fungal photoreactivation capability and the daily accumulation pattern of solar UV irradiation are based to propose an optional strategy for low-risk or non-risk application of fungal pesticides after 3:00 or 5:00 pm during summer.

Since most previous studies on these pesticides are performed merely based on toxicity tests with individual active ingredients, only finite knowledge is available on the mixture toxicities of these formulated compounds to crop pollinators. In this study, we examined their toxicities of binary, ternary, quatemary, quinquenary, senary, septenary and octonary mixtures to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) with feeding toxicity test. Results showed that EMB and ABA had the highest toxicities to A. mellifera with LC50 values of 0.033 (0.028-0.038) and 0.047 (0.039-0.056) mu g a. i. mL(-1) after exposure for 7 days, respectively, followed by DIC with an LC50 value of 1.22 (1.01-1.41) mu g a. i. mL(-1). In contrast, relatively low toxicities were found from pyrethroid insecticides, ACT, and TET with their LC50 values ranged from 44.76 (38.75-50.89) to 251.7 (198.4-297.3) mu g a. i. mL(-1) Most of pesticide mixtures containing ACT and TET elicited synergistic interactions to honey bees. Besides, four pesticide mixtures of ACT + BIF, ACT + BIF + CYP, ACT + BIF + LCY and ACT + CYP + DIC + EMB also displayed synergistic effects. Among 98 tested binary to octonary mixtures of ACT in combination with seven pesticides, 44.90% of combinations exhibited synergistic effects on honey bees.

The lactoperoxidase (LPO) system is a naturally occurring enzyme system with known antimicrobial activity. Stabilized LPO and glucose oxidase (GOx) enzymes were combined with glucose, potassium iodide, and ammonium thiocyanate to create an anti-fungal formulation, which inhibited in-vitro growth of the plant pathogenic oomycete Pythium ultimum, and the plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium graminearum and Rhizoctonia solani. Pythium ultimum was more sensitive than F. graminearum and R. solani, and was killed at LPO and GOx concentrations of 20 nM and 26 nM, respectively. Rhizoctonia solani and F. graminearum were 70% to 80% inhibited by LPO and GOx concentrations of 242 nM and 315 nM, respectively.

Soil, litter, spruce needles and shoots were collected at intervals of time up to 460 d post-spray and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the intact chemical. Droplet density, size spectra (D-N.5 and D-V.5) and initial deposit data were gathered using collection units consisting of Kromekote((R)) cards, glass fibre filters and glass plates. Droplet density, size spectra and deposition varied according to the formulation type sprayed. Deposit levels increased with dosage and the ES formulation usually gave higher deposition on the collectors compared to the AF formulation. Initial deposits (mu g/g, fresh weight) were higher (ca. 150 %) on the spruce needles than on the shoots and varied according to the dosage and type of formulation. Usually, the ES formulation deposited well on all the matrices studied. A significant loss of tebufenozide (ca. 40 to 50 %) from the needles was observed within the first 45 d after application, probably due to various physical and biological processes. Loss from the shoots during the same period was about 70 %. The higher loss in shoots was partly due to growth dilution. The remaining tebufenozide was found to dissipate gradually and persisted until snowfall. Tebufenozide residues, depending on the dosage and formulation, overwintered and persisted at detectable levels up to the end of summer in 1994. Similar trends in the dissipation of tebufenozide were also found in the soil and litter. However, tebufenozide dissipated slowly in the litter and persisted longer compared to the soil, indicating that the litter could act as a sink for the chemical. Tebufenozide showed a low degradation rate in all the matrices studied. The approximate range of DT, values in soil, litter, spruce needles and shoots, irrespective of the type of formulation and dosage rate sprayed, were 32 to 45, 52 to 87, 30 to 49 and 15 to 22;d, respectively.

We have tested the toxicity and endocrine disruption potential of Roundup (Bioforce (R)) on human embryonic 293 and placental-derived JEG3 cells, but also on normal human placenta and equine testis. The cell lines have proven to be suitable to estimate hormonal activity and toxicity of pollutants. The median lethal dose (LD50) Of Roundup with embryonic cells is 0.3% within 1 h in serum-free medium, and it decreases to reach 0.06% (containing among other compounds 1.27 mM glyphosate) after 72 h in the presence of serum. In these conditions, the embryonic cells appear to be 2-4 times more sensitive than the placental ones. In all instances, Roundup (generally used in agriculture at 1-2%, i.e., with 21-42 mM glyphosate) is more efficient than its active ingredient, glyphosate, suggesting a synergistic effect provoked by the adjuvants present in Roundup. We demonstrated that serum-free cultures, even on a short-term basis (1 h), reveal the xenobiotic impacts that are visible 1-2 days later in serum. We also document at lower non-overtly toxic doses, from 0.01% (with 210 mu M glyphosate) in 24 h, that Roundup is an aromatase disruptor. The direct inhibition is temperature-dependent and is confirmed in different tissues and species (cell lines from placenta or embryonic kidney, equine testicular, or human fresh placental extracts). Furthermore, glyphosate acts directly as a partial inactivator on microsomal aromatase, independently of its acidity, and in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxic, and potentially endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup are thus amplified with time. Taken together, these data suggest that Roundup exposure may affect human reproduction and fetal development in case of contamination.

In the first experiment, Conidial viability was assessed in preparations containing water and liposoluble photoprotectants at a concentration of 1% and exposed to solar radiation for 0, 60, and 120 min. In another experiment, preparations containing different concentrations of the selected photoprotectants were exposed to natural and artificial UV radiation for 120 and 5 min, respectively. Insecticide activity of technical grade conidial preparations containing selected photoprotectants were evaluated against first instar nymphs of D. opuntiae. In general, no evaluated compounds showed deleterious effects on conidial germination, and they provided a strong degree of protection over a short period of time. One-percent concentrations of starch and skim milk resulted in low photoprotection over a longer irradiation period, while 1% Neo Heliopan AV, Neo Heliopan E1000 and Oxybenzone provided a moderate degree of protection. Increasing the concentration of Oxybenzone increased germination rate to 70%, while treatment with 1% Neo Heliopan E1000 maintained germination at 50%.

Acid-responsive pesticide is a type of smartly engineered pesticides that contribute to the improvement of utilization efficiency of pesticidal active ingredients in acid-controlled manner, whilst the implementation of acidic solutions may disturb the balance of microenvironment surrounding targeted plants or cause secondary pollution, underscoring the input of acid in a more precise strategy. RESULTS Chitosan was chemically modified with a photoacid generator (2-nitrobenzaldehyde) serving as a light-maneuvered acid self-supplier, based on which a smart pesticide was formulated by the integration of attapulgite and organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos. Under the irradiation of UV light (365 nm), the modified chitosan would undergo a photolytic reaction to generate an acid and pristine chitosan, which seized the labile protons and facilitated the release of chlorpyrifos based on its inherent pH-responsive flexibility. According to the pesticide release performance, the release rate of chlorpyrifos under UV light (27.2 mW/cm(2)) reached 78%, significantly higher than those under sunlight (22%, 4.2 mW/cm(2)) and in the dark (20%) within the same time, consistent with the pH reduction to 5.3 under UV light and no obvious pH change for the two other situations, exhibiting an attractive UV light-controlled, acid-propelled release behavior. CONCLUSION Compared to direct acid spray approach, the proposed in situ photo-induced generation of acid locally on the spots of applied pesticide circumvents the problem of acid contamination to nontargets, demonstrating higher efficiency and biocompatibility for the controlled delivery of acid-responsive pesticides and pest management.",2022,78,2299,2308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6854

Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits against immunogens developed by conjugating proteins (bovine serum albumin, BSA and keyhole limpet hemocyanin, KLH) to endosulfan-diol, 4'-hydroxy-cypermethrin and 2'-hydroxy-cypermethrin using an activated ester method through a spacer attachment. Immunoglobulin (IgG) was purified through protein-A affinity chromatography and conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) and colloidal gold. A competitive ELISA was designed to determine the ability of the test insecticides to compete with the relevant hapten-protein conjugate. A combination of antiserum-4'-OH-Cyper-KLH with the 4'-OH-Cyper-BSA as coating hapten resulted in the highest absorbance (Amax: 1.32) low background value (Amin: 0.05) and good competitive inhibition with cypermethrin (IC99: 2034 mu g/L), deltamethrin (IC99: 2297 mu g/L) and fenvalerate (IC99: 3546 mu g/L). For endosulfan, a combination of antiserum raised against endosulfan-KLH with endosulfan-BSA as the coating hapten gave the highest absorbance (Amax: 1.42), low background value (Amin: 0.05) and good competitive inhibition with endosulfan (IC99: 2378 mu g/L). A novel format was designed using the combinations for development of the lateral-flow strip, so as to enable the detection of pyrethroids and endosulfan on a single strip. The strips were designed such that two intensely coloured purple lines appeared when the strip is dipped in a solution devoid of any insecticide. The minimum concentration of the test insecticides, endosulfan (1800 mu g/l), cypermethrin (800 mu g/l), deltamethrin (1000 mu g/l) and fenvalerate (1400 mu g/l) was determined, which would be adequate to inhibit the appearance of either of the two lines, when the strip is dipped in a solution containing any one of the diluted insecticides prepared from authentic insecticide formulations. When samples of substandard insecticide formulations are diluted as per the pre-determined dilutions, the aliquots are expected to contain less than the quantity specified above, and would result in the appearance of two purple lines, with one of them at the sample line region of the membrane, the intensity of which would be inversely proportionate to the concentration of the test analyte. The strip can be considered as suitable for on-the-spot analysis of test sample formulations either by farmers, extension workers, quality control officials etc., to generate preliminary prima facie evidence in case of doubtful samples of substandard insecticide formulation.

We estimated the optimal timing interval for IRS using a statistical approach. Methods Six rounds of IRS were implemented in Tororo District, a historically high malaria transmission setting in Uganda, during the study period (3 rounds with bendiocarb active ingredient (Ficam (R)): December 2014 to December 2015, and 3 rounds with pirimiphos methyl active ingredient (Actellic 300 (R) CS): June 2016 to July 2018). A generalized additive model was used to estimate the optimal timing interval for IRS based on the predicted malaria incidence. The model was fitted to clinical incidence data from a cohort of children aged 0.5-10 years from selected households observed throughout the study period. Results 494 children, 67% aged less than 5 years at enrolment were analysed. Six-months period incidence of malaria decreased from 2.96 per person-years at the baseline to 1.74 following the first round of IRS and then to 0.02 after 6 rounds of IRS. The optimal time interval for IRS differed between bendiocarb and pirimiphos methyl and by IRS round. To retain an optimum impact, bendiocarb would require respraying 17 (95% CI: 14.2-21.0) weeks after application whereas pirimiphos methyl could remain impactful for 40 (95% CI: 37.0-42.8) weeks, although in the final year this estimates 36 (95% CI: 32.7-37.7) weeks. However, we could not estimate from the data the optimal time after the second and third rounds of bendiocarb and after the second round of pirimiphos methyl. Neither the amount of rainfall nor the EIR nor the distribution of nets were found to be statistically significant for determining the time period between spray rounds. Conclusion In our setting, the effect of the two IRS products was distinct. Statistically, pirimiphos methyl provided a longer window of protection than bendiocarb, although impact varied between different spray rounds and years which was not explained by rainfall or EIR or distribution of nets in our statistical approach. Understanding the effectiveness of IRS and how long it lasts can help for planning campaigns, but one should consider the financial cost and insecticide resistance. Monitoring the timing of spray campaigns using clinical incidence could be repeated in future programs to help determine the average period of protectivity of these products.",2020,15,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241033

Among the 20 matrices developed by entrapping the organophosphorus mosquito larvicide, fenthion, in carboxymethylcellulose ionotropically cross-linked with aluminium ions which were studied for release profiles, two matrices, CRF3b and CRF5b, were found to be stable for 16 and 14 weeks under simulated field conditions. The average concentration of fenthion released per week ranged from 0.06 to 3.5 mg litre(-1) for CRF3b and 0.09 to 2.72 mg litre(-1) for CRF5b. Of these two formulations, CRF3b was the more stable, maintaining the concentration of the active ingredient at the level required to effect mosquito control. The cumulative release of fenthion per pellet was 80% from CRF3b and 72% from CRF5b. Based on the study with fenthion, two similar matrices for triflumuron, a benzoylphenylurea insect growth regulator, STAR3b and STAR5b were developed. These matrices were stable up to 16 weeks with the average concentration of triflumuron released per week ranging from 0.05 to 3.44 mg litre(-1) for STAR3b and 0.07 to 2.71 mg litre(-1) for STAR5b. The cumulative release of triflumuron per pellet was 75% from STAR3b and 76% from STAR5b. From the results of this study under simulated conditions, it is estimated that the application of four pellets of either fenthion or triflumuron per square metre of the breeding surface may play a useful role in controlling Culex quinquefasciatus Say in larval habitats for about 4 months.

In this study, quintozene and a formulation of quintozene widely used on golf Courses, FFII (TM) were tested for toxicity to early life stages of the Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes. For medaka exposed in static non-renewal assays to quintozene for 17 d from the fertilized egg stage to yolk resorption at the fry stage, the LC50 for mortality was a nominal concentration of 707 mu g l(-1) and the effective concentration for 50% hatch (i.e. EC50) was a nominal concentration of 71 mu g l(-1). Eggs and fry showed developmental abnormalities, including ocular malformations and retarded development of the brain, notochord, organs and body segmentation, which were interpreted as teratogenic responses to exposure to PCNB. For medaka exposed to quintozene, the LOECs for abnormalities of the eye and all other developmental abnormalities were 750 and 100 mu g l(-1), respectively. In medaka exposed to the FFII (TM) formulation, similar patterns of mortalities, reduced hatching success and developmental abnormalities were observed, but at higher test concentrations that were consistent with the proportion of quintozene in the formulation.

Chemical control has been the most popular method to manage root-knot nematodes due to its high efficacy. However, 'fenamiphos' the most widely used active ingredient in nematicides, has recently been reviewed by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and subsequently has been recommended for removal from the commercial market in Australia due to concerns about its potential to contribute to adverse environmental and human health impacts. Due to this pressure of nematicide restrictions, alternative chemical and organic formulations were assessed against root-knot nematodes in a sweetpotato field trial comparing with untreated control and chemical control 'oxamyl' (currently registered chemical for sweetpotato).

Conventionally formulated pesticides have several environmental incompatibilities. The use of biocompatible and biodegradable nanocarriers in formulating pesticides could improve environmental protection. In this study, a mixture of imidacloprid and lambda-cyhalothrin was co-encapsulated for the first time using liposomes as nanocarrier to simultaneously deliver these insecticides. Ethanol injection was used to produce self-assembled liposomes. The formed nanoliposomes were coated with different concentrations of chitosan. Nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and FT-IR spectroscopy. The encapsulation efficiencies of lambda-cyhalothrin and imidacloprid were about 93% and 51%, respectively. The insecticide carrying liposomes had a size and surface charge of 57 nm and + 0.6 mV, respectively. The size and surface charge of the particles produced were increased to 69 nm and + 31 mV after being coated with chitosan (0.1%, W/V).

It is an emerging environmental contaminant that has been detected in surface waters, raising the possibility of human exposure via drinking water. Because it is not subject to the same regulations as active pesticide ingredients, its metabolism and toxicity in humans have not been studied. Here we investigate the enantioselective metabolism of benoxacor in human subcellular fractions. Pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM) and cytosol (pHLC) were incubated with racemic benoxacor for up to 30-min. Gas chromatographic analyses were used to measure the enantioselective depletion of benoxacor. pHLMs with and without nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH, co-factor for cytochrome P450 enzymes [CYPs]) and pHLC with glutathione (GSH, co-factor for glutathione Stransferases [GSTs]) metabolized benoxacor. These results demonstrate that microsomal CYPs, microsomal carboxylesterase (CESs), and cytosolic GSTs metabolize benoxacor. Females were predicted to have a higher clearance of benoxacor by GSTs than males. Male and female pHLM incubations with NADPH showed enrichment of the first eluting benoxacor enantiomer (E1-benoxacor). pHLM incubations without NADPH and pHLC incubations with GSH showed an enrichment of the second eluting enantiomer of benoxacor (E2-benoxacor). Our results indicate that human hepatic microsomal and cytosolic enzymes enantioselectively metabolize benoxacor, a fact that needs to be considered when investigating human exposures and toxicities of benoxacor.

This study evaluated the developmental toxicity of T-TEA or T-BEE in time-mated CD rats gavaged on gestation days 6-15 with 0, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day. The doses of each compound were equimolar and equivalent to 22, 76, 216 mg/kg bw/day of triclopyr, based on prior studies indicating rapid cleavage of the salt or ester and equivalent pharmacokinetics for the active ingredient. T-TEA caused matemal toxicity, evidenced by the death of one high-dose dam, reduced body weight gain, increased relative liver and kidney weights (300 mg/kg bw/day), reduced feed consumption, and increased water consumption (100 and 300 mg/kg bw/day). Developmental effects were limited to slightly decreased fetal body weight and reduced skeletal ossification at the high dose level. T-BEE caused similar, albeit slightly more severe, maternal toxicity, with three maternal deaths at 300 mg/kg bw/day, and slight maternal effects at 30 mg/kg bw/day. Due to an equivocal increase in malformations, which were mainly clustered in litters from three high dose dams with marked matemal toxicity, the T-BEE study was repeated using 30 dams/group, investigator-blind fetal evaluations, and an additional dose group (5 mg/kg bw/day). In the repeat study, the only reproducible fetal effect was an increased incidence of 14th thoracolumbar rib at 300 mg/kg bw/day. Overall analysis of the two T-BEE studies suggested that the fetal malformations unique to the initial study likely reflected a combination of spontaneous events, exacerbated by marked maternal toxicity. The combined weight of evidence from these developmental toxicity studies, coupled with their known pharmacokinetic equivalence, indicates that T-BEE and T-TEA are not selectively toxic to the fetus. The respective maternal toxicity no-observed effect levels (NOEL) for T-BEE and T-TEA were 5 and 30 mg/kgbw/day, while the NOEL for developmental toxicity was 100 mg/kg bw/day for both compounds.

Greenhouse producers typically use miticides to control twospotted spider mite (TSM) populations. This study, which involved two replicated experiments, was designed to assess the persistence or longevity and efficacy of translaminar miticides with the active ingredient (a.i.) etoxazole, chlorfenapyr, abamectin, and spiromesifen by applying these miticides to either butterfly bush (Buddleia davidii) or marigold (Tagetes erecta) plants, depending on the experiment, and then artificially infesting the plants with TSM. Based on percent mortality and number of live and dead TSM, several miticides provided adequate control of TSM even after having been applied to the test plants 14 days before being artificially infested with TSM. This suggests that these miticides have extended residual activity.

As an alternative to the use of bait pellets, molluscicidal seed treatments have been shown to protect seeds and seedlings from slug damage in laboratory and semi- field experiments. However, protection offered to plants in field trials was diminished and short-lived in comparison with laboratory experiments. To determine why field efficacy was reduced, we grew seedlings under a range of environmental conditions, with appropriate controls, that simulated differences between laboratory and field experiments. We then measured the metaldehyde content of plant seedlings using a previously unpublished methodology described herein, which, unlike previous methods, did not first depolymerize the metaldehyde to acetaldehyde. We confirmed that naturally abundant plant- derived acetaldehyde could not interfere with our measurements of metaldehyde, even if depolymerization took place within the column. Our data suggest that reduced field efficacy results from microbial breakdown and/ or loss of active ingredient caused by percolating soil water. Once the seedlings had emerged, neither volatalization nor simulated rainwater reduced the metaldehyde content of seedlings. Our findings will help develop superior seed treatment formulations to overcome these constraints.",2006,54,3646,3650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf060231a

This conclusion is based on a quantitative risk assessment that potential human exposure to atrazine and simazine is much smaller than the intakes required to produce adverse health effects in animal experiments. In human health risk assessments, the margin of exposure (MOE1) can be defined as the amount of a substance required to produce adverse health effects in animal experiments divided by the amount a human receives. The larger the MOE is, the safer the exposure. Probabilistic techniques (including Monte Carlo methods) were used to incorporate the variation in individual human exposures and resulting intakes. The frequency distributions of individual intakes and MOEs in a population were estimated from the number of individuals in each of the population's component subpopulations and their corresponding intake distributions. Even when an individual's atrazine and simazine intakes from drinking water ingestion (water) and food consumption (diet) were combined, 95% of the MOEs exceeded 30000. The minimum acceptable MOE for human environmental exposure is usually in the range between 10 and 1000; so the atrazine and simazine MOEs provide an ample safety margin. For atrazine and simazine combined, 95% of the MOEs are in excess of 38 000 for water alone and in excess of 280000 for diet alone. The MOEs were also calculated for herbicide handlers who used atrazine in conjunction with crop production (corn, sorghum, sugarcane, or sod), vegetation management, and residential lawn care, for herbicide handlers using simazine in crop production (corn or sod), and for both flowable and granular herbicide formulations. These MOEs included the combined atrazine and simazine intakes from water and diet. MOEs exceeded 3 000 in at least 95% of the calculations for each use, except for sugarcane, where the MOE exceeded 500. In comparison to a minimum acceptable MOE for occupational exposure (generally, 10-100), the calculated MOEs (including both occupational and environmental exposures) for atrazine and simazine provide an ample safety margin. The MOEs for each herbicide use were calculated not only for the population of all such herbicide handlers, but also for several subpopulations (growers, commercial operators, mixer/loaders, applicators, etc.). The calculation of the frequency distribution of triazine herbicide intake from herbicide handling included data on the size of the different herbicide handler subpopulations, the frequency distribution of pounds of herbicide (active ingredient) applied, the frequency distribution of the amount of exposure inside normal clothing per pound of active ingredient applied (for each body part, herbicide formulation, method of mixing/loading, and method of application), and the frequency distribution of adult body weight. The MOEs for water were calculated for each major-use state and for all major-use states combined. The calculation of the frequency distribution of triazine herbicide intake from water included the number of people using each community water supply system in each major-use state and the corresponding estimates of concentrations of the herbicide in the drinking water in these community water supply systems in each of the four seasons. The MOEs for diet were calculated for different regions and for all regions combined. The calculation of the frequency distribution of herbicide intake from diet included all food potentially exposed to the herbicide, the average amount of each of these foods consumed per day in a lifetime, and the frequency distribution of the residue concentration (triazine herbicide and chloro-metabolites) in each of these foods.",2008,NA,477,499,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-044451167-6.50034-9

The chemical control is the most used alternative to reduce ectoparasites. Nevertheless, inappropriate management of insecticides has contributed to the selection of population resistant to the products available on the market. This paper aimed to evaluate the practices of management and the application of insecticides used to control horn flies in farms of dairy cattle in the North of the state of Minas Gerais. Materials, Methods & Results: It was visited 62 rural properties, which produce milk. Semi-structured questionnaires were applied in order to obtain information on the characteristics of the properties (location, size and type of the cattle), on the knowledge about the epidemiology of the horn flies, and on the practices adopted to the control of those parasites. The practices adopted include the moment of application of the insecticides, frequency of the cattle treatment, used products, method of application, number of animals treated, and choice and substitution criteria of insecticides. The data collected were tabulated in contingency tables, and they were analyzed using the chi-square test, considering a significance of 5%. The racial composition of the cattle in the farms was mainly mixed-race of unknown origin, representing 77% of the animals evaluated. In this research, it was reported a greater incidence of horn flies infestation on adult beef herd, and 23.6% of the producers reported occurrences of infestation in the whole herd, not differing by categories. The infestation peaks of the fly occurred from November to March. It was also found a greater frequency of pyrethroid use in the region (P < 0.001), where 43.1% of the producers used associations of pyrethroid or organophosphate to control the flies, high efficiency being reported. From the properties assessed, 92% presented inadequacy in the practices of control of horn flies, for instance, the lack of using cattle manure tank, the accumulation of open waste, the lack of rotation of insecticides, which can favor the selection of resistant flies. Discussion: In this paper, it was reported 77.19% of predominance of Haematobia irritans infestation from November to March mainly in animals with a higher percentage of European or mixed-race genetics. Such results corroborate with the literature, because it was verified the influence of race and hair color in the level of infestation in the animals, although, in the same race, each individual presents different susceptibilities. Taurine beef cattle are more susceptible to infestation by horn flies than zebu cattle. Thus, the lower the proportion of zebu cattle genetics in the herd, the greater the infestation. Taurine beef cattle are more infested because shows a greater number of sebaceous glands and greater concentration of testosterone being attractive before the calves castrated, cows, and after, young animals. Cypermethrin was predominant in most part of the commercial insecticides used in the properties to control this ectoparasite, which could be justified by the large number of products available on the market with such compound in the formulations. The high efficiency of the associations of the insecticides reported by the producers could justify itself by the presence of active ingredients with different mechanisms of action. However, the limitation on the use of these associations is that not always the chemical compounds contained in the drug act simultaneously, being able to favor the selection of parasites resistant to different insecticides present in these formulations.",2016,44,NA,NA,NA

Previously, technical grade propiconazole (TGP) has been shown to modulate cytochrome P450 activity in mammals and birds. The present study investigated the concentration- and time-dependent effects of TGP on hepatic cytochrome CYP1A gene expression and catalytic activity in rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss). The TGP produced both a mixed-pattern response and a biphasic response for CYP1A expression following waterborne exposure. Evidence for inhibitory complex formation with cytochrome P450 may explain the occurrence of the mixed-pattern response. To further characterize the influence of TGP on CYP1A expression, a comparison was made between TGP and analytical grade propiconazole (AGP) with in vivo and in vitro assays. This comparison demonstrated that induction of the CYP1A gene resulted from unidentified compounds in TGP. Since TGP can be coapplied with other agricultural pesticides, either inhibition or induction of CYP1A protein activity by TGP and potentially other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes may lead to unexpected toxicological interactions.",1999,18,2565,2573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620181125

To improve herbicide efficacy and to prevent further spread of resistance, herbicide mixtures with different mode of action might be a solution. The aim of this study was to investigate potential interactions of ALS- and ACCase inhibiting herbicides on different A. spica-venti populations. Mixtures of pinoxaden with met- and thifensulfuron caused antagonism in herbicide performance to all populations tested. Tank mixtures of pinoxaden with flora- and pyroxsulam showed different interactions according to the status of resistance of the tested populations. Populations susceptible to both herbicides showed additive effects indicating that herbicides in the mixture do not influence their respective efficacy. Resistant populations showed not necessarily the same reaction to this herbicide mixture. In target-site resistant populations the efficacy of mixtures was increased with higher portions of the active ingredient still effective on the population. For populations with non-target-site resistance mechanisms the reaction was unpredictable depending on the population and mixture ratio. Synergism, antagonism and additive effects could be observed.

The nursery site was approximately 60 ha with two interconnected ponds, one for containment of runoff water and one serving as a source of irrigation water. The most commonly used herbicides were oxyfluorfen plus pendimethalin (granular formulation-Ornamental Herbicide 2); approximately twice as much herbicide was applied during the second year of the study. Herbicide levels found in pond water and sediment were approximately two-fold greater during the second year corresponding to the increase in active ingredients applied.

Type-l fairy ring is especially destructive due to the development of water repellent or hydrophobic soil conditions and the subsequent decline and damage to the existing turfgrass. Fairy ring management strategies, particularly the control or suppression of Type-l fairy ring symptoms, has been inconsistent in effectiveness. The objective of this field study was to evaluate the efficacy of fungicides recommended for fairy ring control when applied alone and with a soil surfactant. This research was conducted on cool-season turfgrass in California in 2005, and in Pennsylvania in 2006. The same treatments were applied at both locations. The four fungicide treatments were evaluated at 620 g active ingredient (a.i.) azoxrtrobin(.)ha(-1), 9757 g a.i. flutolanil(.)ha(-1), 310 g a.i polyoxin-D(.)ha(-1), or 558 g a.i. pyraclostrobin(.)ha(-1). Each fungicide was applied alone and in a tank-mix combination with the modified alkylated polyol soil surfactant (100% concentration) at 19 L product(.)ha(-1). All treatments were applied at two water carrier volumes of 814 and 1628 L(.)ha(-1). At both locations, Typed fairy ring symptoms were noticeably reduced in plots treated with fungicides plus soil surfactant at either water carrier volume versus plots treated with fungicides alone applied at 814 L water carrier ha(-1). Therefore, the consistently best overall treatment for the control or suppression of Typed fairy ring symptoms was fungicides plus soil surfactant at either water carrier volume. The application of plant protection products at the lower water volume is preferred by turfgrass managers and practitioners; thus the utility of soil surfactants applied with fungicides is a useful strategy for the chemical control of fairy ring in turf.",2008,1500,77,+,http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP47509S

Bacteria were grown in medium containing either formulated or technical-grade glufosinate from 0.01 to 100 mM, and growth was monitored by-turbidity measurements over time. Glufosinate inhibited bacterial growth at concentrations of I mM or greater and delayed growth at concentrations as low as 0.01 mM. Metabolism of [C-14]glufosinate by P. syringae pv. glycinea grown in Davis. minimal medium containing either a sublethal (1 mM) or a lethal (100 mM) glufosinate concentration was measured incrementally up to 45 h after inoculation. Thin-layer chromatography analysis revealed the presence of three glufosinate metabolites in addition to the parent compound. The rate of [C-14]glufosinate metabolism by bacteria was greater in medium treated with 1 mM than in medium treated with 100 mM glufosinate. More C-14 was recovered as 3-methylphosphinicopropionic,acid and as an unidentified metabolite with an Rf value of 0.45 in medium treated with I mM than in medium treated with 100 mM glufosinate. These data suggest that P. syringae pv. glycinea can slowly metabolize glufosinate into less toxic metabolites, resulting in greater bacterial growth in medium treated with 1 mM glufosinate. Treatment of transgenic glufosinate-resistant (GR) soybeans with field rates of glufosinate reduced the number of live P. syringae pv. glycinea at 90 h after inoculation. Inoculated GR soybeans showed a 45 1.0 reduction of colony forming units after treatment with 0.5 kg/ha glufosinate and a 60% reduction after treatment with 1.0 kg/ha glufosinate.

As the C12E6 concentration was increased up to the critical micelle concentration (CMC = 0.067 mM), an increasing amount of surfactant mass was deposited onto the wax film. Alongside surface adsorption, C12E6 was also observed to penetrate the wax film, which is evident from the NR measurements using fully protonated and chain-deuterated surfactants. Furthermore, surfactant action upon the model wax film was found to be physically reversible below the CMC, as water rinsing could readily remove the adsorbed surfactant, leaving the wax film in its original state. Above the CMC, the detergency action of the surfactant became dominant, and a significant proportion of the wax film was removed, causing structural damage. The results thus reveal that both water andC(12)E(6) could easily penetrate the wax film throughout the concentration range measured, indicating a clear pathway for the transport of active ingredients while the removal of the wax components above the CMC must have enhanced the transport process. As the partial removal of the wax film could also expose the underlying cutaneous substrate to the environment and undermine the plant's health, this study has a broad implication to the roles of surfactants in crop care.",2018,34,3395,3404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00143

Rates of cuticular penetration have been modelled based on two processes, namely solute mobility in cuticles (k*) and partitioning of ai or adjuvants between the formulation residue, and cuticular waxes (K-wxfr). The model distinguishes between effects of ai and adjuvants on k* and on driving force of penetration, which is proportional to the product KwxfrCfr, the latter variable being the concentration of the ai in the formulation residue. Solute mobilities in cuticles varied greatly among species but for neutral ai it depended only on molar volumes and not on lipophilicity. Solute mobility decreased exponentially with increasing size of ai but size selectivity (beta') was the same for cuticles from all plant species tested and also for extracted cuticles (polymer matrix). Differences in solute mobility among species were related to the term k(*o), which represents the mobility of a hypothetical molecule having zero molar volume. While size selectivity did not change on extraction of cuticular waxes k(*o) increased by orders of magnitude depending on plant species. Evidence is presented showing that differences in solute mobility among species and higher solute mobility in extracted cuticles are related to the tortuosity factor. Crystalline waxes increase the lengths of the diffusion paths and decrease mobility in cuticles proportional to the tortuosity factor Solute mobilities increased with increasing temperatures and it is argued that at 5 to 10 degreesC solute mobilities can become so low that significant penetration of a is prevented.",1999,NA,134,151,http://dx.doi.org/10.1533/9781845698416.3.134

In addition, concurrent treatment with technical-grade penconazole and an organophosphate (OP) insecticide has been shown to enhance the acute toxicity of OP insecticides to mammalian and avian species. This enhancement was hypothesized to result from induction of a cytochrome P450-catalyzed reaction(s) that was responsible for activating pare nt OP insecticides to their toxic oxon metabolite. The present study was conducted to determine if pre-exposure to TGP would enhance the acute toxicity of the OP insecticide parathion to an aquatic species. Pre-exposure to TGP enhanced the acute toxicity of parathion to fathead minnows (Pimphales promelas). In vitro, TGP-treated hepatic microsomes isolated from fathead minnows had an increased parathion activation rate to paraoxon. An increased parathion activation rate may have been the mechanism responsible for enhancing parathion toxicity. Since TGP is concurrently applied with OP insecticides, the acute toxicity of OP insecticides to non-target organisms may be enhanced by previous exposure to TGP.

A series of experiments was conducted to examine short term changes in soil bacterial populations stimulated by carbofuran application at field rates. In the field experiment, commercially formulated carbofuran and butylate (S-ethyl diisobutyl carbamothioate) were applied at 5.6 kg al ha-1 and 8.4 kg ai ha-1, respectively, on a soil (Putnam silt loam) exhibiting enhanced degradation of carbofuran. In laboratory studies, technical grade carbofuran (20 mg kg-l soil) was applied to samples of the field soil. Bacterial populations were estimated using non-selective (tryptic soy agar) and selective media containing carbofuran or butylate. Largest population increases in pesticide-treated soil were observed between 7 and 15 days after treatment (DAT) compared to populations in non-treated soil. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in total bacterial populations and presumed carbofuran-degraders due to carbofuran application were associated with increased populations of Pseudomonas spp. and Flavobacterium spp. Application of carbofuran appeared to provide a competitive advantage to these species over actinomycetes persisting beyond 20 DAT . Growth responses of bacteria to carbofuran in the Putnam soil were compared to those in a native prairie soil (Mexico silt loam), which exhibited a much slower rate of carbofuran degradation. Bacterial population response to carbofuran was measurable, but small and short-lived. Perpetuation of the enhanced degradation phenomenon may lie in a persistent pesticide-induced competitive advantage given to a very small segment of the MiCrobial population. This advantage may not be detectable after 20 days using conventional plating techniques",1992,27,139,154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601239209372771

In this study, toxicity of the four organic solvents methanol, ethanol, acetone, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea were determined. EC50 values of methanol, ethanol, acetone and DMSO against S. sclerotiorum were 13.5, 24.3, 21.8, and 20.1 mu l/ml, respectively, and EC50 values of the four solvents against B. cinerea were 20.7, 30.2, 57.2, and 20.6 mu l/ml, respectively. At solvent concentrations from 1 to 10 mu l/ml (0.1 % to 1 % v/v), the EC50 values of the fungicides dimethachlon and pyraclostrobin decreased along with the increase of solvent concentration. Interaction analysis based on inhibition percentages of mycelial growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA) identified synergistic, additive, and rarely antagonistic interactions between fungicide and solvent. Permeability of cell membrane of S. sclerotiorum grown on PDA amended with ethanol, acetone or DMSO at 1 % was significantly higher than at 0.1 % and that of the solvent-free control.

Their consideration in life cycle assessment (LCA) is affected by important inconsistencies between the emission inventory and impact assessment phases of LCA. A clear definition of the delineation between the product system model (life cycle inventory-LCI, technosphere) and the natural environment (life cycle impact assessment-LCIA, ecosphere) is missing and could be established via consensus building. A workshop held in 2013 in Glasgow, UK, had the goal of establishing consensus and creating clear guidelines in the following topics: (1) boundary between emission inventory and impact characterisation model, (2) spatial dimensions and the time periods assumed for the application of substances to open agricultural fields or in greenhouses and (3) emissions to the natural environment and their potential impacts. More than 30 specialists in agrifood LCI, LCIA, risk assessment and ecotoxicology, representing industry, government and academia from 15 countries and four continents, met to discuss and reach consensus. The resulting guidelines target LCA practitioners, data (base) and characterisation method developers, and decision makers. The focus was on defining a clear interface between LCI and LCIA, capable of supporting any goal and scope requirements while avoiding double counting or exclusion of important emission flows/impacts. Consensus was reached accordingly on distinct sets of recommendations for LCI and LCIA, respectively, recommending, for example, that buffer zones should be considered as part of the crop production system and the change in yield be considered. While the spatial dimensions of the field were not fixed, the temporal boundary between dynamic LCI fate modelling and steady-state LCIA fate modelling needs to be defined. For pesticide application, the inventory should report pesticide identification, crop, mass applied per active ingredient, application method or formulation type, presence of buffer zones, location/country, application time before harvest and crop growth stage during application, adherence with Good Agricultural Practice, and whether the field is considered part of the technosphere or the ecosphere. Additionally, emission fractions to environmental media on-field and off-field should be reported. For LCIA, the directly concerned impact categories and a list of relevant fate and exposure processes were identified. Next steps were identified: (1) establishing default emission fractions to environmental media for integration into LCI databases and (2) interaction among impact model developers to extend current methods with new elements/processes mentioned in the recommendations.",2015,20,765,776,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0871-1

The experiments were arranged in a randomised-block design, in a bi-factorial scheme, with factor A comprising the herbicides, and factor B the herbicide doses X and 2X, where X is the recommended dose of the active ingredient (a.i.). The treatments to be evaluated were: 2,4-D amine (806 and 1,612 g a.i. ha(-1)); metsulfuron-methyl (2.4 and 4.8 g a.i. ha(-1)); chlorimuron-ethyl (20 and 40 g a.i. ha(-1)); imazethapyr (350 and 700 g a.i. ha(-1)); diclosulam (16.8 and 33.6 g a.i. ha(-1)); saflufenacil (35 and 70 g a.i. ha(-1)) and flumioxazin (50 and 100 g a.i. ha(-1)), as well as the control (no herbicide).

Here we present a low-cost, wide-range algae-based biosensor that is easy to assemble and operate by untrained users and provides direct readings. It was developed as a request of a peasant social movement organization to assess the toxicity of drinking water in rural communities affected by pesticide spraying. Two fresh water algae strains, Scenedesmus acutus and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, were immobilized in alginate beads and tested as bioindicators. After incubation with different pollutants for five days, naked eye analysis by several observers proved to be a successful method to survey algae's growth and establish the detection limits. Best detection limits were 10 ppm for technical-grade acid glyphosate, 15 ppm for glyphosate-based formulation, 50 ppb for atrazine formulation, 7.5 ppm for copper and 250 ppb for chromium. Absorbance measurements upon algae resuspension validated these results. The developed device was successfully tested in participatory workshops conducted at rural communities. Children, adults and elders with no scientific training were able to build the sensor and interpret the results, thus evaluating the quality of rain and well water used in their communities.

Unfortunately, it has limited residual activity on plants because sunlight inactivates spores and crystals and they can be washed off by rain.

We tested approximate to 80 formulations and determined optimal combinations of ingredients and spray drying conditions for improving B. thuringiensis residual activity after simulated rain and simulated sunlight. B. thuringiensis stability, after simulated sunlight (xenon light/8 h) and rain (5 cm/50 min), was improved using formulations based on lignin, corn flours, or both, with up to 20% of the active ingredient, when compared with technical powder or Dipel 2x in laboratory assays. Two formulations, made with corn flours or lignin + pregelatinized corn flour (PCF), killed 51.6 and 75.3% of Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) neonates after rain, respectively, versus 27% for technical powder. When the insecticidal activity was tested after simulated sunlight, corn flour-based formulations killed 78.5% of test larvae, and the lignin + PCF formulation killed 70.4%, in contrast to technical powder which caused an average of 29% mortality.

In all field-collected strains, a variable fraction of the population exhibited tolerance to Raid Max. In some strains, few males were killed in the first 5 d of exposure to Raid Max and some lived for up to 123 d when provided Raid Max only. Field-collected males that were given access to Raid Max for only 3 h following a 45-h starvation exhibited a 22-fold delay in mortality of 50% of the population compared with males that were continuously exposed to Raid Max. Males exposed to COMBAT for 3 h exhibited a similar pattern of mortality as males continuously exposed to this bait. Field-collected males provided COMBAT with or without rat chow exhibited identical patterns of mortality. However, males that were offered Raid Max along with rat chow exhibited significantly delayed mortality compared with males given Raid Max alone. A direct comparison of 1% hydramethylnon and sulfluramid, the active ingredients in COMBAT and Raid Max, respectively, in rat chow showed that physiological resistance to sulfluramid was involved; field-collected males consumed both baits equally on the first day, but whereas 100% of the males that were fed hydramethylnon-containing chow died within 5 d, only one of 25 males fed sulfluramid-baited rat chow died during this period, and males continued to consume large amounts of food. This suggested that, in the presence of alternate foods, the effective dose of sulfluramid was diminished, resulting in reduced mortality in males fed Raid Max. These results suggest that relatively high levels of resistance to sulfluramid are pervasive in field populations of the German cockroach. Experiments in which cockroaches were exposed to vapors of Raid Max or sulfluramid without direct contact showed that both acted as fumigants. The Raid Max bait remained lethal without direct contact for at least 170 d of continuous aeration in a fume hood.

Effective chemical control strategies are urgently required to improve integrated SWD management. Insecticide use should be incorporated in an IPM strategy that adopts cultural and biological control methods and tools to ensure high protection of cherry production while fulfilling export market requirements. Laboratory and field trials were conducted in North-Eastern Italy to identify the most effective and sustainable insecticides to be used against SWD in cherry orchards. In the laboratory, cherries previously infested by SWD were dipped in insecticide solutions to assess their effectiveness in controlling eggs and larvae. In other laboratory trials cherries were first treated with insecticides and then exposed to adults to assess residual activity. A number of chemical control strategies (including one designed for organic orchards) were then compared in cherry orchards. These strategies were planned also considering the need to control the European cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cerasi L., a key pest of cherry in Europe and elsewhere. A number of formulations based on cyantraniliprole, spinosad, spinetoram, phosmet, lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin were effective against different life stages of SWD in the laboratory. SWD control in the field was influenced by the use of above-mentioned insecticides and the number of applications during the cherry ripening period. Insecticides selected for the protection of organic cherry orchards were almost ineffective. Some strategies defined for conventional orchards were also effective against R. cerasi. In most cases (dimethoate was the exception) insecticide residues were lower than maximum residue limits required by the European Union to export cherries to major markets. In conditions of high pest pressure, three to four applications with active ingredients having different modes of action were needed to keep D. suzukii and R. cerasi damage beneath economic thresholds. Sanitation and harvest management could be helpful in lowering pesticide use. A number of tactics such as insect-proof nets, biological and cultural methods should be incorporated for an effective IPM strategy with benefits not only for human and environmental health but also in terms of the lifetime of currently effective insecticides.

The residues were dipped in a range of chemicals, including fungicides, herbicides, and surfactants, to determine possible manipulative effects of the chemicals on the development of the fungus including ascospore discharge. Treated residues were placed in the field during the growing season. Ascospore discharge was found to be closely related to pseudothecial maturity and density. There was no significant difference between pseudothecial maturation on the crown component compared with the stem component. A high correlation between rainfall and pseudothecial density suggested that rainfall was a good complimentary indicator for timing of ascospore discharge. These results may provide the canola industry with a potential method of monitoring pseudothecial development for estimating disease hazards. This would allow manipulation of sowing times so as to minimise or avoid heavy ascospore showers coinciding with the early seedling phase. Twenty chemical treatments showed significant efficacy in decreasing ascospore numbers early in the season, most often by delaying the development of the pseudothecia on the residues. Two scenarios were formulated giving growers the potential to manipulate pseudothecial development and/or ascospore discharge. Firstly, a number of chemicals, such as fluquinconazole, technical grade flutriafol, and gluphosinate-ammonium, were able to delay pseudothecial development and subsequent ascospore discharge was decreased by 100%, 99%, and 96%, respectively. This scenario gives growers the potential to minimise synchronisation of ascospore discharge with early crop establishment. Secondly, a situation where pseudothecial development is not delayed, but number of ascospores discharged is reduced (e.g. ziram by 45%) would only be effective if the reduction resulted in a less severe disease epidemic. There is significant potential for development of commercial chemical treatments of residues to reduce disease pressure on seedlings.",2003,54,837,848,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR03056

Volatility from 2,4-D dimethylamine (DMA) was determined to be greater than that of 2,4-D choline in chambers where temperatures were held at 30 or 40 C and relative humidity (RH) was 20% or 50%. Air concentration of 2,4-D DMA was 0.399 mu g m(-3) at 40 C and 20% RH compared with 0.005 mu g m(-3) for 2,4-D choline at the same temperature and humidity at 24 h after application. Volatility from 2,4-D DMA and 2,4-D choline increased as temperature increased from 30 to 40 C. However, volatility from 2,4-D choline was lower than observed from 2,4-D DMA. Volatility from 2,4-D choline at 40 C increased from 0.00458 to 0.0263 mu g m(-3) and from 0.00341 to 0.025 mu g m(-3) when humidity increased from 20% to 50% at 72 and 96 h after treatment, respectively, whereas, volatility from 2,4-D DMA tended to be higher at 20% RH compared with 50% RH. Air concentration of dicamba diglycolamine was similar at all time points when measured at 40 C and 20% RH. By 96 h after treatment, there was a trend for lower air concentration of dicamba compared with earlier timings. This method using volatility chambers provided good repeatability with low variability across replications, experiments, and herbicides.",2018,32,691,697,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wet.2018.75

In the present study, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of malathion and isomalathion either individually or in combination, were assessed using the metabolically Competent human liver HepaRG cell line. Isomalathion reduced cell viability starting at a 100 mu M concentration after a 24 h exposure. It also significantly induced caspase-3 activity in a dosedependent manner starting at 5 mu M. On the contrary, even at concentrations as high as 500 mu M malathion affected neither cell viability nor caspase-3 activity. Moreover, co-exposure of both compounds resulted in decreased toxicity of isomalathion. By contrast, malathion and isomalathion either separately or in combination, slightly induced micronuclei formation at low concentrations and had additive genotoxic effects when combined at 25 mu M. Individually or combined isomalathion directly inhibited activity of carboxyesterases which are involved in detoxication of malathion. In addition, transcripts of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, two CYPs responsible for malathion phase I metabolism, were strongly induced by the mixture while isomalathion alone only moderately decreased CYP1A2 and increased CYP2B6 transcripts. However, these CYPs were not altered at the protein or activity levels. Taken altogether, our results showed that isomalathion was much more cytotoxic than malathion while both compounds had comparable genotoxic effects in HepaRG hepatocytes at low concentrations and brought further support to the importance of considering impurities and interactions during evaluation of health risks of pesticides.

Plants metabolize the two diastereomers of the formulations known as technical grade endosulfan (TGE) by two phase I pathways: hydrolysis leading to less toxic derivatives and oxidation giving endosulfan sulfate which is as toxic as endosulfan itself. We assessed the removal, bioaccumulation and phase I metabolization of TGE from water matrices using hairy root clones (HRs) of three edible species, Brassica napus, Raphanus sativus and Capsicum annuum. B. napus and C. annuum HRs removed 86% of TGE from the bioreaction media in 2 and 96 h, respectively, whereas R. sativus HRs removed 91% of TGE within 6 h of biotreatment. In the experiments with B. napus, only endosulfan sulfate was detected in both biomass and medium, whereas R. sativus and C. annuum accumulated endosulfan sulfate and endosulfan alcohol. Besides, endosulfan lactone was detected in C. annuum reaction medium.

Methods In three study villages, suitable households were randomly allocated to five treatments: Fludora(R) Fusion 562.5 WP-SB (target dose 225 mg active ingredient AI/m(2)); clothianidin 70 WG (target dose 200 mg AI/m(2)); K-Othrine 250 WG (deltamethrin, target dose 25 mg AI/m(2)); Ficam VC 80 WP-SB (bendiocarb, target dose 400 mg AI/m(2)) and unsprayed control. Insecticides were sprayed by hand compression sprayers with control flow valves and 8002E nozzles. Post-spray cone bioassays were done on insecticide-treated walls using a colonised, deltamethrin-resistant strain of An. culicifacies. Mosquitoes were collected from treated rooms by different methods. The insecticide content on filter papers collected from the sprayed walls was determined by chemical assay to assess the spray quality. Results The ratios of applied to target doses of insecticides were within 0.84 to 1.4, showing a good spray quality. The cone bioassays revealed residual action lasting 7 months for all insecticides without significant differences in mortality between different surfaces treated nor between the four treatment arms (P > 0.05). Considering all entomological parameters such as indoor resting density, excito-repellency, blood-feeding inhibition and delayed mortality, the overall efficacy of Fludora(R) Fusion WG-SB was equal or better compared with other insecticides. Conclusions Fludora(R) Fusion showed overall equal or better efficacy than deltamethrin and bendiocarb alone against a pyrethroid-resistant malaria vector population and can be considered as an alternative product for management of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors.",2021,26,469,477,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13549

However, occurrence of quiescent infections requires pre-harvest applications of biocontrol agents (BCA), exposing them to harmful UV radiation effects. The objective of this work was to evaluate UV sensitivity of yeast BCA strains previously selected against multiple pathogens that cause mango decay and evaluate suitable UV protectants. In a first bioassay conducted exposing yeast suspensions sprayed on glass plates, it was verified that Saccharomyces sp. ESA47 and Pichia kudriavzevii CMIAT171 were highly sensitive to UV, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae ESA45 had a slightly lower mortality. A bioassay using fragments of mango peels evaluated UV protection from increasing concentrations of starch, dextrin, casein, benzophenone, and cinnamic acid derivative compounds. Results showed that starch and isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate (NHE-1000) resulted in higher survival for yeast strains in doses of 10.0 and 1.0gkg(-1), respectively. Application of the yeast BCA in a semi-commercial mango orchard resulted in a significant reduction of post-harvest disease incidence and severity.

The low sorption of fluensulfone across the soils indicates that partitioning of fluensulfone to the soil liquid phase may be unlimited.

The microspheres were prepared by a modified hydrophobic congealable disperse-phase method. The influence of experimental parameters, such as the reciprocal ratio between the amounts of pesticide and wax employed, on size, morphology, loading efficiency, and release behavior of the particles was evaluated. Microspheres were free-flowing and showed a nonporous scaly surface at SEM analysis. The mean particle size ranged from 15.8 to 19.8 mum and was independent of the amount of Gelucire used to prepare the microspheres. At a fixed Gelucire content, the increase in theoretical carbaryl content yielded up to 72% loading efficiency, whereas at a fixed carbaryl content the increase in Gelucire amount produced a 64% increase in encapsulation efficiency. These data were accounted for by the carbaryl leakage from molten Gelucire toward the dispersing aqueous phase. The release profiles of carbaryl from microspheres showed that the use of increasing amounts of waxy material decreased the carbaryl release rate, whereas at a fixed Gelucire content, the release was the slowest when carbaryl was not completely dissolved within the matrix. The possibility to achieve different burst effects by simply varying the formulation parameters offers an efficient tool to ensure the fast release of an active dose of insecticide. The lower vertical mobility of carbaryl encapsulated in waxy microspheres compared to the vertical mobility of the technical-grade product showed that the controlled-release system has a lower potential risk for groundwater contamination.",2001,49,4808,4812,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010418w

Technical grade spinosad (spinosyns A and D), was topically applied to third instars. Initially 533 third instars were used but one to two thousand larvae were treated per generation thereafter. Initially mortality ranged from 75% to 85% with doses of 0.044-0.088mug per larva, until the fifth generation (G5) when mortality decreased. The selection dose was subsequently increased every generation from G5 to G11 in an attempt to restore mortality to > 70%. After six generations of selection, the LD50 of the selected budworms was 1.68-times that of the parental generation (G1) as estimated 15 d after treatment. By G14, the topical LD50 of the selected insects was 1068-fold greater than the parental generation. Four additional populations of the budworm from the southeastern US demonstrated similar LD(50)s to spinosad as our parental strain, suggesting that the parental budworms from North Carolina were representative of field populations elsewhere. The resistance ratio determined with spinosad (formulated as Tracer(R)) in heliothine diet was 314-fold at 15 d after the start of exposure. Injection of spinosad into the larval hemocoel resulted in a > 163-fold resistance ratio 15 d after injection, indicating that resistance could not be explained simply by altered penetration alone. Mortality was delayed in the resistant relative to the parental generation regardless of whether third instars were topically treated or exposed to treated diet. Spinosad resistance was also expressed in G14 adults, indicating that an adult vial test would be feasible for monitoring resistance.

This inter-disciplinary study evaluated an Insecticide Resistance Management-based Integrated Pest Management (IRM-IPM) programme in cotton and compared it with non-IRM production for a range of IPM and economic measures. The IRM-IPM programme has been implemented in 28 districts of 10 states of India since 2002 to help rationalize and reduce the use of insecticides and to overcome the development of resistance in cotton pests, especially Helicoverpa armigera. The IRM-IPM strategy includes applying insecticides only when pests exceed economic threshold levels, using selective insecticides that are compatible with biological control, and rotating between different insecticide classes. The IRM-IPM programme we evaluated resulted in a reduction in insecticide consumption (technical grade material) by 30%, and it reduced the number of sprays by 15%; however, it did not result in a significant change in productivity. The majority of IRM farmers avoided using highly toxic insecticides such as monocrotophos, avoided use of synthetic pyrethroids beyond 140 days after sowing to avoid resurgence of Bemisia tabaci, and rotated the insecticide compounds/groups to delay the development of resistance and ensured effective management of H. armigera. On average, the IRM-IPM programme resulted in a return of US $24.05 ha(-1) (at 2005 rates: US $1 = 45 Indian rupees), by saving on insecticide costs.

Since a single in vitro assay has proved inadequate for evaluating the toxicity of a chemical and its ability to cause an irritant response, a combination of assays was employed to examine the potential toxicities of two pesticide formulations. The surfactant-based vehicles had toxicities that reflected their surfactant concentration. The formulation containing 5% permethrin required a more concentrated vehicle than was needed to dissolve 0.1% cypermethrin. In vitro, the ID50 dose (i.e. the dose which inhibited the increase in total cellular protein by 50%) was 576 mu g/ml for the permethrin formulation and 1080 mu g/ml for the cypermethrin formulation.

DFB is potentially toxic to nontarget biota because it can enter aquatic systems through aerial application or runoff after precipitation events. Based on this concern, the objectives of this study were to: (1) compile, review, and synthesize literature on the fate, persistence, and environmental concentrations of DFB in both freshwater and saltwater environments; (2) compile, review, and synthesize acute and chronic aquatic toxicity data on DFB effects on freshwater and saltwater organisms; (3) assess possible risk to aquatic biota associated with the use of this insecticide in one specific area (Maryland); and (4) recommend future research based on the data gaps identified from this study. DFB has low solubility in water and exists as a technical grade (TG) and wettable powder (WP) formulation. The toxicity of both formulations is similar at concentrations <10-mu-g/l. Organic matter is a major factor influencing the adsorption and degradation of DFB in freshwater, saltwater, and sediment. The half-life of this insecticide in freshwater is almost-equal-to 3 days at a pH of 10 and temperature of 36-degrees-C. At lower pH conditions of 6 and at the same temperature, DFB is more persistent since half-life values of almost-equal-to 9 days have been reported. The half-life of DFB in soil is <14 days when the particle size was almost-equal-to 2-mu-m. The half-life is generally greater in cool, dry soil than in hot, wet soil. Aquatic vegetation acts as a sink for DFB by gradually adsorbing the chemical and releasing it over a period of time. Freshwater organisms demonstrated a wide range of sensitivity to DFB. Sensitivity was dependent on body composition (i.e., exo- vs. endoskeleton), trophic level, and life stage. During acute exposures, aquatic invertebrates were more than 25,000 times as sensitive to DFB than fishes. The most acutely sensitive species tested was the Amphipod, Hyallela azteca (96-h LC50 = 1.84-mu-g/l). A mature Plecopteran, Skwala sp., was the most resistant invertebrate species tested in acute tests (96-h LC50 > 100,000-mu-g/l). In chronic tests, DFB concentrations of 1-mu-g/l or greater were reported to eliminate populations of various Plecopteran (stoneflies) and Ephemeropteran (mayflies) species after 1 month of exposure. A 30-day LC50 of 0.1-mu-g/l DFB was also reported for the Tricopteran, Clistorinia magnifica. Freshwater fish were resistant to acute exposures of DFB as 96-h LC50s were generally >50,000-mu-g/l. Fish were also reported to accumulate DFB rapidly during acute exposures but were capable of eliminating this insecticide within 7 days. Most of the DFB aquatic toxicity studies with saltwater organisms were conducted with invertebrates. The most acutely sensitive species tested was the premolt stage of grass shrimp (96-h LC50 = 1.11-mu-g/l). The mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, the most resistant species tested, had a 96-h LC50 of 32.99 mg/l. The lowest reported chronic effect concentration for saltwater organisms exposed to DFB was 0.075-mu-g/l. This concentration was reported to significantly reduce reproduction in the mysid shrimp, Mysidopsis bahia. Data from the State of Maryland were used as an example for predicting the potential environmental effects of DFB on aquatic biota in Maryland waters. A case can be made for possible environmental effects given the worst case conditions of the most sensitive species (premolt stage of grass shrimp with a 96-h LC50 of 1.11-mu-g/l) exposed to the highest reported environmental concentration (1.5-mu-g/l DFB in water). However, in most cases, the present data base would suggest that environmental effects are not likely.",1992,22,45,79,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10408449209145321

Every seven days, the numbers of semi-engorged females were counted and laboratory tests were conducted using different commercial technical-grade products for resistance monitoring. Results G4 showed the best percentage reduction, with the highest rate on the seventh day post-treatment (DPT) (83.23%). G3 was the second best strategy, with a percentage of inverse reduction such that the best results were on the 28th DPT (82.85%), while G1 and G2 reached their best results on the 21st DPT (32.63% and 2.79%). Conclusion It was noteworthy that the formulation used in G4 was the only one that was efficient for strategic control and that, based on the economic analysis, was shown to be economically viable over the medium term due to the need for investment. The presence of a multidrug-resistant strain in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul in vitro, for the chemical bases amitraz, cypermethrin and cypermethrin + DDVP, is reported here for the first time.",2022,67,1564,1572,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11686-022-00611-8

We explored the joint impact of glyphosate and the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei on freshwater phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and periphyton, and on the physical and chemical properties of the water. We manipulated both stressors simultaneously in a 25-day experiment using outdoor mesocosms; we assayed technical-grade glyphosate acid at four concentrations: 0, 1, 3 and 6 mg gly L-1 under scenarios with and without mussels. The addition of the glyphosate significantly increased total phosphorus according to the concentration used; the high clearance rate of L. fortunei significantly decreased phytoplanktonic abundance leading to low values of turbidity. The mussel significantly stimulated the development of filamentous green algae (metaphyton). Interestingly, the combined effect revealed that L. fortunei accelerated the dissipation of glyphosate, which showed a 4-fold decrease in its half-life; this promoted the rapid bioavailability of glyphosate-derived phosphorus in the water. The interaction had a synergistic effect on soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations and was directly dependent on the concentration of glyphosate. A synergistic effect was also observed on bacterioplankton, water turbidity and metaphyton, thus inducing enhanced and rapid eutrophication. The ability of mussels to reduce glyphosate in water may be valued as positive, but our results allow us to predict that the invasion of Limnoperna fortunei in natural freshwater systems contaminated by glyphosate will accelerate the negative impact of the herbicide associated with eutrophication.",2016,25,56,68,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-015-1566-x

The potential exposure to pesticides creates a concern for occupants in affected homes, apartments, and other occupied buildings. Pesticides that are improperly applied within these locations may require remediation prior to reoccupation. Incident response personnel rely heavily on data from sampling results to identify residue levels and determine when site remediation is complete. Surface wipe samples are often collected for this purpose. Therefore, it is important to ensure sampling and analysis procedures are well estab-lished for the contaminants of concern, particularly for wipe sampling variables that can affect analysis results. This investigation evaluated the effects of surface wipe media, wipe wetting solvents, pesticide concentrations effects, com-posite sampling, surface types, and pesticide formulation effects on analysis results for fipronil, permethrin, and delta-methrin. Tested surface types included galvanized steel, vinyl tile, and plywood. Wipe media included pre-packaged, sterile cotton gauze, pre-cleaned cotton twill, and a pre-packaged, pre-wetted wipes. Surface recovery results are re-ported for commercially available fipronil formulations and compared to technical grade fipronil solutions. Fipronil recoveries were 92-107 % for twill wipes, 81-98 % for cotton gauze wipes, and 79 % for pre-packaged, pre-wetted wipes on a galvanized steel surface. Permethrin recoveries were 83-116 % for twill wipes, 66-94 % for cotton gauze wipes, and 73 % for pre-packaged, pre-wetted wipes on a galvanized steel surface. Deltamethrin recoveries were 67-88 % for twill wipes, 55-71 % for cotton gauze wipes, and 63 % for pre-packaged, pre-wetted wipes on a galvanized steel surface. The data collected in this study can inform surface wipe sampling methods and potentially assist in obtaining more accurate sampling data associated with pesticide misuse incidents involving the target analytes.",2023,856,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159053

This study focused on improving biocontrol efficacy by adjusting doses of a BCA formulation and the timing for the substitution of synthetic fungicides sprays. Technical grade formulations containing increasing doses (104 - 108) of the yeast strains Saccharomyces sp. ESA45, S. boulardii ESA46, Saccharomyces sp. ESA47, and Pichia kudriavzeviii CMIAT171 were applied to mango fruits, followed by the inoculation of Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Neofusicoccum parvum in artificial wounds. Non-linear regression analysis of increasing doses of the BCAs against severity data and curve slopes comparison showed a significant difference in control efficiency among yeast strains. A log-linear regression model showed that ESA45 and CMIAT171 exhibited lower doses to achieve 90% control. Two field experiments were conducted in commercial mango orchards cultivated with the cultivars 'Kent' and 'Palmer'. Starting the substitution of fungicides by BCA in fruit onset and when fruits achieved egg size resulted in lower fruit rot incidence and severity during cold storage and shelf life. The complete substitution of fungicides during fruit development did not show consistent performance. Similarly, applying BCA formulation only at the end of fruit development did not hinder the establishment of quiescent infections.",2022,170,NA,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2022.104912

Each experiment consisted of the uniform application of a 0.4-cm pulse of a solution containing a mixture of the four chemicals to the surface of a 1.5 x 1.5-m plot. The plot was then irrigated with 12 cm of water and soil samples were collected and analyzed to a depth of 150 cm. In all, 64 different plots were employed to study individual as well as interactive effects of such variables as irrigation method (continuous or intermittent sprinkling or ponding), pesticide formulation method (technical grade dissolved in water, wettable powder, or emulsifiable concentrate), and tillage (undisturbed or tilled and repacked surface layer) on pesticide transport. While all three pesticides were expected to be retained in the top 10-20 cm, there was considerable movement below this zone. When averaged over all the treatments, 18.8% of the recovered mass of atrazine, 9.4% of the prometryn and 16.4% of the napropamide were found between 30- and 150-cm depth. Moreover, all pesticides were highly mobile in the surface 30 cm regardless of their adsorption coefficient. There were occurrences of extreme mobility or preferential flow of pesticide under every experimental condition except where the pesticides were applied in wettable powder form to plots which had their surface tilled and repacked. This finding implies that there may be fine preferential flow pathways through which solution may move but particulates may not.",1992,11,101,125,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-7722(92)90036-E

Wild-caught California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi (Richardson), were individually housed in the laboratory to serve as natural hosts to O. montana and for on-animal insecticide trials. Several concentrations of technical grade fipronil and imidacloprid in acetone were applied to samples of clean rodent bedding to determine residual activity and longevity against fleas. Immature and adult cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche), were used as representative fleas for periodic assays in place of less fecund O. montana. Toxicity of treated bedding did not decrease significantly for I yr at all applied concentrations. Fipronil provided 100% kill for at least 1 yr at greater than or equal to100 ppm, whereas imidacloprid required 10,000 ppm for similar performance. Laboratory squirrels were treated with topical formulations of fipronil (Frontline Top Spot) and imidacloprid (Advantage Flea Adulticide) at a dosage rate of 15 mg/kg and evaluated for residual activity every 2 wk against adult O. montana. Residual activity was determined by percent recovery of O. montana adults released on treated and untreated animals after 48 h. Frontline provided 100% kill of adult fleas for at least 10 wk, and up to 26 wk oil one animal. Advantage failed to provide 100% kill of adult fleas at 2 wk. with complete loss of efficacy by week 6. Concurrent assays with bedding samples from squirrel nest boxes showed negligible toxicity transfer from treated animals to nest bedding.",2002,39,152,161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585-39.1.152
